"'''John Doe'''" (for males) and "'''Jane Doe'''" (for females) are [[multiple-use name]]s that are used when the true name of a person is unknown or is being intentionally concealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/ceos-delego-indictment-twitched.pdf |title=Twitched Indictment|publisher=Justice.gov|accessdate=2 October 2012}}</ref><ref name="ireland"/> In the context of [[law enforcement in the United States]], such names are often used to refer to a [[Dead body|corpse]] whose identity is unknown or unconfirmed. Secondly, such names are also often used to refer to a hypothetical "[[everyman]]" in other contexts, in a manner similar to "'''[[John Q. Public]]'''" or "Joe Public". There are many variants to the "John Doe" and "Jane Doe" names, many others such include "'''John Roe'''", "'''Richard Roe'''", "'''Jane Roe'''" and "'''Baby Doe'''", "'''Janie Doe'''" or "'''Johnny Doe'''" (for children). 

==Use in criminal investigation==
In other [[English-speaking countries]], unique placeholder names, numbers or [[codename]]s have become more often used in the context of police investigations. This has included the [[United Kingdom]], where usage of "John Doe" originated during the [[Middle Ages]]. However, the legal term ''John Doe injunction'' or ''John Doe order''<ref name="order">{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=30920&sectioncode=1 |title=Obtaining a John Doe order |publisher=PressGazette |date= |accessdate=2 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911032452/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=30920&sectioncode=1 |archivedate=11 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> has survived in [[English law]] and other legal systems influenced by it. Other names used informally such as "'''[[Joe Bloggs]]'''" or "'''John Smith'''" have sometimes been informally used as placeholders for an everyman in the UK, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; such names are seldom used in legal or police circles in the same sense as John Doe.

Well-known legal cases named after placeholders include:
* the landmark 1973 [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] decision regarding abortion: ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) and;
* the civil cases ''Doe dem. John Hurrell Luscombe v Yates, Hawker, and Mudge (1822) 5 B. & Ald. 544'' (England; 1822),<ref name="england">{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/law/case-law/Doe-dem-Luscombe-v-Yates-1822|title=Deed Poll Office (D·P·O)|author=|date=|website=Deed Poll Office|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> ''McKeogh v.

Use of "John Doe" in the sense of an everyman, includes:
* the 1941 film ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' and;
* the 2002 US television series [[John Doe (TV series)|''John Doe'']].

Use of "Jane Doe" in the sense of an unidentified corpse, includes:

==History==
Under the [[Roman law|legal terminology of Ancient Rome]], the names [[Numerius Negidius|"''Numerius Negidius''"]] and "''Aulus Agerius''" were used in relation to hypothetical defendants and [[plaintiff]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The name "John Doe" (or "John Doo"), "Richard Roe," along with "John Roe", were regularly invoked in English legal instruments to satisfy technical requirements governing standing and jurisdiction, beginning perhaps as early as the reign of England's King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] (1327–1377).<ref name="Webster1996">{{cite book |title=What's In A Name |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-87779-613-8}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref> Though the rationale behind the choice of Doe and Roe are still unknown with many suggested [[folk etymologies]].<ref name="mentalfloss.com">{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/29996/why-are-unidentified-people-called-john-or-jane-doe|title=Why Are Unidentified People Called John or Jane Doe?|author=|date=15 February 2012|website=mentalfloss.com|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> Other fictitious names for a person involved in litigation in medieval English law were "John Noakes" (or "Nokes") and "John-a-Stiles" (or "John Stiles").<ref name="Noakes">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-joh2.htm |title=World Wide Words – John DoeZ|publisher=Worldwidewords.org|accessdate=2 October 2012}}</ref> The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' states that John Doe is "the name given to the [[legal fiction|fictitious]] lessee of the plaintiff, in the (now obsolete in the UK) mixed action of [[ejectment]], the fictitious defendant being called Richard Roe".<ref name="mentalfloss.com"/>

This usage is mocked in the 1834 English song "John Doe and Richard Roe":
<div><blockquote><poem>
Two giants live in Britain's land,
John Doe and Richard Roe,
Who always travel hand in hand,
John Doe and Richard Roe.
Their fee-faw-fum's an ancient plan
To smell the purse of an Englishman,
And, 'ecod, they'll suck it all they can,
John Doe and Richard Roe ...<ref name=songster>{{cite book|title=The Universal Songster: Or, Museum of Mirth: Forming the Most Complete, Extensive, and Valuable Collection of Ancient and Modern Songs in the English Language, with a Copious and Classified Index, Volume 1|date=1827|publisher=Jones and Company|location=London|page=378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWQLAAAAYAA|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref>
</poem></blockquote></div>
This particular use became obsolete in the UK in 1852:
<blockquote>As is well known, the device of involving real people as notional lessees and ejectors was used to enable freeholders to sue the real ejectors. These were then replaced by the fictional characters John Doe and Richard Roe. Eventually the medieval remedies were (mostly) abolished by the Real Property Limitation Act of 1833; the fictional characters of John Doe and Richard Roe by the Common Law Procedure Act 1852; and the forms of action themselves by the Judicature Acts 1873–75." <br />''Secretary of State for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Respondent) v Meier and another(FC) (Appellant) and others and another (FC)(Appellant) and another (2009).''<ref name="SC">{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2009_0087_Judgment.pdf |publisher=Supremecourt.gov.uk|title=Supreme Court Decided Cases (pdf)|accessdate=2 October 2012}}</ref></blockquote> In the UK, usage of "John Doe" survives mainly in the form of John Doe Injunction or John Doe Order (see above).<blockquote>8.02 If an unknown person has possession of the confidential personal information and is threatening to disclose it, a 'John Doe' injunction may be sought against that person. The first time this form of injunction was used since 1852 in the United Kingdom was in 2005 when lawyers acting for JK Rowling and her publishers obtained an interim order against an unidentified person who had offered to sell chapters of a stolen copy of an unpublished Harry Potter novel to the media.<ref name="uae">{{cite web|url=http://www.uea.ac.uk/law |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030707131130/http://www.uea.ac.uk/law/resources/8-02.htm |archivedate=7 July 2003 |title=THE LAW OF PROFESSIONAL-CLIENT CONFIDENTIALITY: Regulating the Disclosure of Confidential Personal Information, Update |website=Uea.ac.uk}}</ref></blockquote> Unlike the United States, the name "John Doe" does not actually appear in the formal name of the case, for example: X & Y v Persons Unknown [2007] HRLR 4.<ref name="eady">{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmcumeds/memo/press/uc7502.htm |title=Uncorrected Evidence 75 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=2 October 2012}}</ref>

Well-known cases of unidentified corpses include "[[Murder of Tammy Alexander|Cali Doe]]" (1979) and "[[Princess Doe]]" (1982). The baby victim in a 2001 murder case in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], was referred to as [[Precious Doe]].<ref>{{cite news

In 2009, the ''New York Times'' reported the difficulties and unwanted attention experienced by a man actually named John Doe, who had often been suspected of using a [[pseudonym]]. He had been questioned repeatedly by airport security staff. Another man named John Doe was often suspected of being an incognito celebrity.<ref name="nyt2009">{{cite news |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/a-name-only-a-lawyer-could-love/ | title=Meet John Doe.

==Other variants==
In cases where a large number of unidentified individuals are mentioned, numbers may be appended, such as "Doe #2" or "Doe II". [[Operation Delego]] (2009), which targeted an international child sexual abuse ring, cited 21 numbered "John Does", as well as other people known by the surnames "Doe", "Roe", and "Poe".

"John Stiles", "Richard Miles" have been used for the third and fourth participants in an action. "Mary Major" has been used in some [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal cases in the US]].<ref name="wwwords">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-joh2.htm |publisher=World Wide Words |title=John Doe |author=Quinion M |date=15 March 2003 |accessdate=26 November 2008}}</ref> "James Doe" and "Judy Doe" are among other common variants. 

Less often, other surnames ending in ''-oe'' have been used when more than two unknown or unidentified persons are named in U.S. court proceedings, ''e.g.'', ''Poe v. Snyder'', 834 F.Supp.2d 721 (W. D. Mich. 2011),<ref>{{cite web |title=Poe v. Snyder|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020111228719|website=www.leagle.com}}</ref> whose full style is

The use and selection of pseudonyms is not standardized in U.S. courts and the practice itself is opposed on legal grounds by some and was rare prior to 1969.
:"Currently there are no court rules about pseudonym use. The rules of civil procedure,...are silent on the matter..."
