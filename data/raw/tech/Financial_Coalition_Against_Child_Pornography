The '''Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography''' (FCACP) is a coalition of [[credit card]] issuers and [[Internet]] services companies that seeks to eliminate commercial [[child pornography]] by taking action on the payment systems that are used to fund these illegal operations.

In 2006, the [[International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children]] (ICMEC), the [[National Center for Missing & Exploited Children]] (NCMEC), and a number of banks, credit card companies, and electronic and third party [[payment network]]s created the Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography.<ref name=perspectives>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjXn3zA7HFcC&pg=PA514|title=International Perspectives on the Assessment and Treatment of Sexual Offenders: Theory, Practice and Research|author1=Reinhard Eher |author2=Leam A.

This U.S.-based effort expanded regionally with the creation of the Asia Pacific Financial Coalition in August 2009.
