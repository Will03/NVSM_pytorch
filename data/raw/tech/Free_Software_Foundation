The '''Free Software Foundation''' ('''FSF''') is a [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] founded by [[Richard Stallman]] on 4 October 1985 to support the [[free software movement]], which promotes the universal freedom to study, distribute, create, and modify [[computer software]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fsf.org/about/ |title=Free software is a matter of liberty, not price|publisher=Free Software Foundation| accessdate=2012-07-22}}</ref> with the organization's preference for software being distributed under [[copyleft]] ("share alike") terms,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html |publisher=Free Software Foundation |title=Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses |accessdate=2012-07-22}}</ref> such as with its own [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What Is Copyleft? |url=https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=2012-07-22}}</ref> The FSF was incorporated in [[Massachusetts]], [[United States|US]], where it is also based.<ref name="FSF MACorpRegistry">{{cite web|url=http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/CorpSearchSummary.asp?ReadFromDB=True&UpdateAllowed=&FEIN=042888848|title=FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC.

From its founding until the mid-1990s, FSF's funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write [[free software]] for the [[GNU Project]]. Since the mid-1990s, the FSF's employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the [[free software community]].

Consistent with its goals, the FSF aims to use only [[free software]] on its own computers.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/linux-gnu-freedom.html |title = Linux, GNU, and freedom |accessdate = 2006-12-10 |author = Stallman, Richard M. |authorlink = Richard Stallman |year = 2002 |work = Philosophy of the GNU Project |publisher = GNU Project }}</ref>

==History==
{{cleanup|reason=the timeline of the narrative|date=May 2014}}
The Free Software Foundation was founded in 1985 as a non-profit corporation supporting [[free software]] development. It continued existing GNU projects such as the sale of manuals and [[Magnetic tape data storage|tapes]], and employed developers of the free software system.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html |title=The GNU Project |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref> Since then, it has continued these activities, as well as advocating for the free software movement. The FSF is also the steward of several free software licenses, meaning it publishes them and has the ability to make revisions as needed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html |title=Licenses |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref>

The FSF holds the copyrights on many pieces of the [[GNU]] system, such as [[GNU Compiler Collection]]. As holder of these copyrights, it has the authority to enforce the [[copyleft]] requirements of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) when [[copyright infringement]] occurs on that software.

From 1991 until 2001, GPL enforcement was done informally,  usually by Stallman himself, often with assistance from FSF's lawyer, [[Eben Moglen]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Typically, GPL violations during this time were cleared up by short email exchanges between Stallman and the violator.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In the interest of promoting copyleft assertiveness by software companies to the level that the FSF was already doing, in 2004 [[Harald Welte]] launched [[gpl-violations.org]].

In late 2001, [[Bradley M. Kuhn]] (then executive director), with the assistance of Moglen, David Turner, and [[Peter T. Brown]], formalized these efforts into FSF's GPL Compliance Labs. From 2002-2004, high-profile GPL enforcement cases, such as those against [[Linksys]] and OpenTV, became frequent.<ref>{{cite web |last = Meeker |first = Heather |title = The Legend of Linksys |date= 2005-06-28 |url = http://linuxinsider.com/story/qECCd2x743n32T/The-Legend-of-Linksys.xhtml |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090419230853/http://linuxinsider.com/story/qECCd2x743n32T/The-Legend-of-Linksys.xhtml |archivedate = 2009-04-19}} Hosted on the [[Wayback machine]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |last = Gillmor |first = Dan |title = GPL Legal Battle Coming? |publisher = SiliconValley.com (a division of the [[San Jose Mercury News]]) |date= 2003-05-21 |url = http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001029.shtml |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030524174013/http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001029.shtml |archivedate = 2003-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last = Turner |first = David |author2=[[Bradley M.

GPL enforcement and educational campaigns on GPL compliance was a major focus of the FSF's efforts during this period.<ref>{{cite web |last = Kennedy |first = Dennis |date= 2004-01-11 |title = A Great Learning Opportunity for Software Lawyers&nbsp;— Upcoming GPL Seminar |url = http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2004/01/a_great_learning_opportunity_f.html |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928125310/http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2004/01/a_great_learning_opportunity_f.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/18/1835252 |publisher= [[Slashdot]] |last = Lord |first = Timothy |date= 2003-07-18 |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |title = Seminar On Details Of The GPL And Related Licenses}}</ref>

In March 2003, [[SCO v. IBM|SCO filed suit against IBM]] alleging that IBM's contributions to various [[free software]], including FSF's [[GNU]], violated SCO's rights. While FSF was never a party to the lawsuit, FSF was [[subpoena]]ed on November 5, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |last = Heise |first = Mark |title = SCO Subpoena of FSF |publisher = Free Software Foundation |date= 2003-11-05 |url = https://www.fsf.org/licensing/sco/sco-subpoena.pdf |format = PDF |accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref> During 2003 and 2004, FSF put substantial advocacy effort into responding to the lawsuit and quelling its negative impact on the adoption and promotion of free software.<ref>{{cite web |last = Kuhn |first = Bradley |authorlink = Bradley M.

From 2003 to 2005, FSF held legal seminars to explain the GPL and the surrounding law.<ref>{{cite web |title = Seminar On Details Of The GPL And Related Licenses |url = http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/18/1835252 |accessdate = 2008-07-04 |date = 2003-07-18}}</ref> Usually taught by [[Bradley M.

In 2007, the FSF published the third version of the [[GNU General Public License]] after significant outside input.<ref>{{cite web |title=GNU General Public License |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html |accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/gplv3-draft-4.html |title=gplv3.fsf.org comments for discussion draft 4}}</ref>

In December 2008, FSF filed a lawsuit against [[Cisco]] for using GPL-licensed components shipped with [[Linksys]] products. Cisco was notified of the licensing issue in 2003 but Cisco repeatedly disregarded its obligations under the GPL.<ref>{{cite web |last = Paul |first = Ryan |title = Free Software Foundation lawsuit against Cisco a first |date = 2007-12-13 |publisher = [[Arstechnica.com]] |url = https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081211-free-software-foundation-lawsuit-against-cisco-a-first.html |accessdate = 2008-12-11}}</ref> In May 2009, FSF dropped the lawsuit when Cisco agreed to make a monetary donation to the FSF and appoint a Free Software Director to conduct continuous reviews of the company's license compliance practices.<ref>{{cite web |last = Paul |first = Ryan |title = Cisco settles FSF GPL lawsuit, appoints compliance officer |date = 2009-05-21 |publisher = [[Arstechnica.com]] |url = https://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/05/cisco-settles-fsf-gpl-lawsuit-appoints-compliance-officer.ars |accessdate = 2009-10-06}}</ref>

==Current and ongoing activities==
;The [[GNU Project]]: The original purpose of the FSF was to promote the ideals of free software. The organization developed the [[GNU]] operating system as an example of this.
;GNU licenses: The [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) is a widely used license for free software projects. The current version (version 3) was released in June 2007. The FSF has also published the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL), the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), and the [[GNU Affero General Public License]] (AGPL).

;The [[Free Software Directory]]: This is a listing of software packages that have been verified as free software. Each package entry contains 47 pieces of information such as the project's homepage, developers, programming language, etc. The goals are to provide a search engine for free software, and to provide a cross-reference for users to check if a package has been verified as being free software. FSF has received a small amount of funding from [[UNESCO]] for this project. It is hoped{{By whom|date=May 2010}} that the directory can be translated into many languages in the future.
;Maintaining the [[Free Software Definition]]: FSF maintains many of the documents that define the free software movement.
;Project hosting: FSF hosts software development projects on its [[GNU Savannah|Savannah]] website.
;[[h-node]]: An abbreviation for "Hardware-Node", the ''h-node'' website lists [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[device driver]]s that have been verified as compatible with free software. It is user-edited and volunteer supported with hardware entries tested by users before publication.<ref>[http://sdtimes.com/fsf-debian-join-forces-help-free-software-users-find-hardware-need/ FSF and Debian join forces to help free software users find the hardware they need]</ref><ref>[http://sourceforge.jp/magazine/14/09/11/062900 FSFとDebianがGNU/Linuxハードウェア情報サイトh-node.orgを共同支援]</ref><ref>[https://www.h-node.org/ Hardware-Node Database]</ref>

[[Defective by Design]] is an FSF-initiated campaign against DRM. It also has a campaign to promote [[Ogg]]+[[Vorbis]], a free alternative to [[proprietary formats]] like [[MP3]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]]. FSF also sponsors free software projects it deems "high-priority".
;Annual awards: "[[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]]" and "[[Free Software Award for Projects of Social Benefit]]"
;[[LibrePlanet]] wiki:The LibrePlanet wiki organizes FSF members into regional groups in order to promote free software [[activism]] against [[Digital Rights Management|Digital Restrictions Management]] and other issues promoted by the FSF.

==High priority projects==
[[File:Gnewsensescreenshot.png|thumb|300px|[[gNewSense]] is a distribution officially supported by the ''FSF'']]

The FSF maintains a list of "high priority projects" to which the Foundation claims that "''there is a vital need to draw the [[free software community]]'s attention''".<ref name="highpriority">{{cite web|url=https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/ |title=High Priority Free Software Projects |publisher=Free Software Foundation |authorlink=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref> The FSF considers these projects "''important because computer users are continually being seduced into using [[non-free software]], because there is no adequate free replacement.''"<ref name="highpriority" />

Current high priority tasks include [[reverse engineering]] proprietary firmware; reversible debugging in [[GNU Debugger]]; developing [[Transcription (service)|automatic transcription]] and [[video editing software|video editing]] software, [[Coreboot]], drivers for [[network routers]] and creating replacements for [[Skype]], [[Google Earth]], [[OpenDWG]] libraries, [[BitTorrent Sync]] and [[Oracle Forms]].<ref name="highpriority" />

Previous projects highlighted as needing work included the [[Free Java implementations]], [[GNU Classpath]], and [[GNU Compiler for Java]], which ensure compatibility for the Java part of [[OpenOffice.org]], and the [[GNOME]] desktop environment (see [[Java (Sun)#Licensing|Java: Licensing]]).<ref>https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/changelog</ref>

The effort has been criticized by [[Michael Larabel]] for either not instigating active development or for being slow at the work being done, even after certain projects were added to the list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTAwMTY |title=The Sad State Of FSF's High Priority Projects |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2014-12-29 |quote=''Long story short, being on the Free Software Foundation's high priority list really doesn't mean much with some of these "important" projects not even being actively developed or even discussed.''|first=Michael |last=Larabel |authorlink=Michael Larabel |publisher=[[Phoronix]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTA5MDk |title=Many FSF Priority Projects Still Not Progressing|date=2012-04-22|accessdate=2014-12-29|quote=''Most of the projects are basically not going anywhere.

==Hardware endorsements (RYF)==
{{See also|Coreboot|Libreboot}}
The FSF maintains a "Respects Your Freedom" (RYF) hardware certification program. To be granted certification, a product must use 100% Free Software, allow user installation of modified software, be free of [[Backdoor (computing)|back doors]] and conform with several other requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/criteria |title=Respects Your Freedom hardware certification requirements |publisher=Free Software Foundation |date=Jan 27, 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2014 |author=Josh Gay}}</ref>

Currently, a total of 27 products have been granted the certification, including three [[laptop]]s, a [[3D printer]], a [[wireless router]], and three [[USB]] interface [[wireless adapter]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/respects-your-freedom|title=Respects Your Freedom hardware product certification |publisher=Free Software Foundation |date=October 9, 2012 |accessdate=30 October 2015 |author=Gay, Joshua}}</ref>

Among the 27 certified products are:
* The [[Libreboot]] X200 laptop

==Structure==
===Board===
{{update section|date=May 2014}}

The FSF's [[board of governors]] includes amongst themselves professors at leading universities, senior engineers, and founders. A few high-profile activists, and software businessmen are admitted as well. Currently on the board there is one high-profile activist, and one world-class, software-campaign strategist (Windows 95, ''et al.''). There was once a majorly contributing programmer (Mono and Gnome) and businessman who lost favor badly. Founders are also major software developers of the free software in the GNU Project.

[[William John Sullivan|John Sullivan]] is the current FSF executive director. Previous members that occupied the position were [[Peter T. Brown]] (2005–2010) and [[Bradley M. Kuhn]] (2001–2005).

===Legal===
[[Eben Moglen]] and [[Dan Ravicher]] previously served individually as [[pro bono]] legal counsel to the FSF. After forming the [[Software Freedom Law Center]], Eben Moglen continued to serve as the FSF's general counsel until 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-announces-change-in-general-counsel|title=FSF announces change in general counsel — Free Software Foundation — working together for free software|website=www.fsf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref>

===Financial===
Most of the FSF funding comes from patrons and members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html|title=About the GNU Project|last=Stallman|first=Richard|work=Gnu Project|publisher=FSF|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> Revenue streams also come from free-software-related compliance labs, job postings, published works, and a [[web store]]. FSF offers speakers and seminars for pay, and all FSF projects accept donations.

Revenues fund free-software programs and campaigns, while cash is invested conservatively in [[socially responsible investing]]. The financial strategy is designed to maintain the Foundation's long-term future through economic stability.

The FSF is a tax-exempt organization and posts annual IRS Form 990 filings online.<ref name="IRS Form 990">{{cite web|title=2014 Free Software Foundation IRS Form 990|url=http://static.fsf.org/nosvn/Form990_FY2014.pdf|accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>

==Criticism==
[[Linus Torvalds]] has criticized FSF for using [[GPLv3]] as a weapon in the fight against [[Digital rights management|DRM]]. Torvalds argues that the issue of DRM and that of a software license should be treated as two separate issues.<ref>{{cite web|author=à 21:00 |url=http://linuxfr.org/nodes/85904/comments/1230981 |title=Original version |publisher=LinuxFr.org |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref>

On June 16, 2010, Joe Brockmeier, a journalist at ''[[Linux Magazine]]'', criticized the [[Defective by Design]] campaign by the FSF as "negative" and "juvenile" and not being adequate for providing users with "credible alternatives" to proprietary software.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Party of Gno.| accessdate = 2010-06-22 |url = http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7806/1.html}}</ref> FSF responded to this criticism by saying "that there is a fundamental difference between speaking out against policies or actions and smear campaigns", and "that if one is taking an ethical position, it is justified, and often necessary, to not only speak about the benefits of freedom but against acts of dispossession and disenfranchisement."<ref>[https://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2011/fall/in-defense-of-negativity In defense of negativity — Free Software Foundation — working together for free software]. https://www.fsf.org.
