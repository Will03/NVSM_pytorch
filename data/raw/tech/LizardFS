LizardFS is a distributed, scalable and fault-tolerant file system. This is achieved by spreading data over several physical servers and their associated physical data storage. This storage is presented to the end-user as a single logical name space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/lizardfs/lizardfs/wiki|title=www.github.com/lizardfs/lizardfs/wiki|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref> The file system is designed so that it is possible to add more disks and servers “on the fly”, without the need for any server reboots or shut-downs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Korenkov|first=V.

Alternatively, a time-limited trial version of the Windows client is available and high availability can be achieved manually by scripting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itcentralstation.com/product_reviews/lizardfs-review-34235-by-valentin-hobel|title=Review of LizardFS by a Real User|publisher=}}</ref>
