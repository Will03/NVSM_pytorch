'''''Ars Technica''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑːr|z|_|ˈ|t|ɛ|k|n|ᵻ|k|ə}}; a [[Latin]]-derived term that the site translates as the "art of [[technology]]") is a website covering news and opinions in technology, science, politics, and society, created by Ken Fisher and Jon Stokes in 1998. It publishes news, reviews, and guides on issues such as [[computer hardware]] and [[software]], science, [[technology policy]], and video games. Many of the site's writers are postgraduates and some work for [[research institution]]s. Articles on the website are written in a less-formal tone than those in traditional journals.

''Ars Technica'' was privately owned until May 2008, when it was sold to [[Condé Nast|Condé Nast Digital]], the online division of Condé Nast Publications. Condé Nast purchased the site, along with two others, for $25 million and added it to the company's ''Wired'' Digital group, which also includes ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' and, formerly, [[Reddit]]. The staff mostly works from home and has offices in [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[London]], [[New York City]], and [[San Francisco]].

The operations of ''Ars Technica'' are funded primarily by [[online advertising]], and it has offered a paid subscription service since 2001. The website generated controversy in 2010, when it experimentally prevented readers who used [[Ad filtering|advertisement-blocking]] software from viewing the site.

== History ==
Ken Fisher and Jon Stokes created the ''Ars Technica'' [[website]] and [[limited liability company]] in 1998.<ref name=latin/><ref name=llc/> Its purpose was to publish [[computer hardware]]- and [[software]]-related news articles and guides;<ref name=boomtown/> in their words, "the best multi-[[operating system|OS]], [[personal computer|PC]] hardware, and tech coverage possible while&nbsp;... having fun, being productive, and being as informative and as accurate as possible".<ref name=orig_mission_statement/> "Ars technica" is a [[Latin]] phrase that translates to "Art of Technology".<ref name=boomtown/> The website published news, reviews, guides, and other content of interest to computer enthusiasts. Writers for ''Ars Technica'' were geographically distributed across the United States at the time; Fisher lived in his parents' house in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], Stokes in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and the other writers in their respective cities.<ref name=llc/><ref name=orig_staff/>

On May 19, 2008, ''Ars Technica'' was sold to Condé Nast Digital, the online division of [[Condé Nast|Condé Nast Publications]].{{efn|Condé Nast Digital was named CondéNet at the time.<ref name="CondéNet" />}} The sale was part of a purchase by Condé Nast Digital of three unaffiliated websites costing $25 million in total: ''Ars Technica'', [[Webmonkey]], and ''[[HotWired]]''. ''Ars Technica'' was added to the company's ''Wired'' Digital group, which included ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' and [[Reddit]]. In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Fisher said other companies offered to buy ''Ars Technica'' and the site's writers agreed to a deal with Condé Nast because they felt it offered them the best chance to turn their "hobby" into a business.<ref name=nytimes_buyout/> Fisher, Stokes, and the eight other writers at the time were employed by Condé Nast, with Fisher as [[editor-in-chief]].<ref name=boomtown/><ref name=arrington/> Layoffs at Condé Nast in November 2008 affected websites owned by the company "across the board", including ''Ars Technica''.<ref name=layoffs/>

On May 5, 2015, ''Ars Technica'' launched its United Kingdom site to expand its coverage of issues related to the UK and Europe.<ref name="Ars Technica UK" /> The UK site began with around 500,000 readers and had reached roughly 1.4 million readers a year after its launch.<ref name="UK 1 year"/> In September 2017, Condé Nast announced that it was significantly downsizing its ''Ars Technica'' UK arm, and laid off all but one member of its permanent editorial staff.<ref name="Digiday">{{cite web|last1=Jessica|first1=Davies|title=Conde Nast's Ars Technica struggles in UK expansion - Digiday|url=https://digiday.com/media/conde-nasts-ars-technica-struggles-uk-expansion/|website=''[[Digiday]]''|accessdate=November 12, 2017|date=September 1, 2017}}</ref>

== Content ==
The content of articles published by ''Ars Technica'' has generally remained the same since its creation in 1998 and is categorized by four types: news, guides, reviews, and features. News articles relay current events. ''Ars Technica'' also hosts OpenForum, a free [[Internet forum]] for the discussion of a variety of topics.

Originally, most news articles published by the website were relayed from other technology-related websites. ''Ars Technica'' provided short commentary on the news, generally a few paragraphs, and a link to the original source. After being purchased by Condé Nast, ''Ars Technica'' began publishing more original news, investigating topics, and interviewing sources themselves. A significant portion of the news articles published there now are original. Relayed news is still published on the website, ranging from one or two sentences to a few paragraphs.

''Ars Technica''{{'}}s features are long articles that go into great depth on their subject.<ref name=atlantic/><ref name=guardian_long_os_revs/> For example, the site published a guide on [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[Computer architecture|architecture]] in 1998 named "Understanding CPU caching and performance".<ref name=old_cpu_guide/> An article in 2009 discussed in detail the [[Scientific theory|theory]], [[physics]], [[mathematical proof]]s, and applications of [[quantum computer]]s.<ref name=qubits/> The website's 18,000-word review of [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPad]] described everything from the product's packaging to the specific type of [[integrated circuit]]s it uses.<ref name=ipad_review/>

''Ars Technica'' is written in a less-formal tone than that found in a traditional journal.<ref name=nature/><ref name=bonetta/> Many of the website's regular writers have postgraduate degrees, and many work for academic or private [[research institution]]s. Website cofounder Jon Stokes published the computer architecture textbook ''Inside The Machine'' in 2007;<ref name=inside_the_machine/> John Timmer performed [[postdoctoral research]] in [[Neural development|developmental neurobiology]];<ref name=nature/> Until 2013, Timothy Lee was a scholar at the [[Cato Institute]], a [[policy institute|public-policy institute]], which republished ''Ars Technica'' articles by him.<ref name=cato/><ref name=cato_lee/> Biology journal ''[[Disease Models & Mechanisms]]'' called ''Ars Technica'' a "conduit between researchers and the public" in 2008.<ref name=dmm/>

On September 12, 2012, ''Ars Technica'' recorded its highest daily traffic ever with its [[iPhone 5]] event coverage. It recorded 15.3 million [[page view]]s, 13.2 million of which came from its live blog platform of the event.<ref name="MinOnline" />

== Revenue ==
The cost of operating ''Ars Technica'' has always been funded primarily by [[online advertising]].<ref name=niemanlab/> Originally handled by Federated Media Publishing, selling advertising space on the website is now managed by Condé Nast.<ref name=arrington/> In addition to online advertising, ''Ars Technica'' has sold subscriptions to the website since 2001, now named Ars Premier subscriptions. Subscribers are not shown advertisements, and receive benefits including the ability to see exclusive articles, post in certain areas of the ''Ars Technica'' forum, and participate in live [[chat rooms]] with notable people in the computer industry.<ref name=subs-faq/> To a lesser extent, revenue is also collected from content sponsorship. A series of articles about the future of collaboration was sponsored by [[IBM]],<ref name=niemanlab/> and the site's Exploring [[data center|Datacenters]] section is sponsored by [[data management|data-management]] company [[NetApp]]. In the past, ''Ars Technica'' collected [[Revenue sharing|shared revenue]] from [[affiliate marketing]] by advertising deals and discounts from online retailers, and from the sale of ''Ars Technica''-branded merchandise<!--until when?-->.<ref name=sales-merch-2001/>

=== Advertisement block ===
On March 5, 2010, ''Ars Technica'' experimentally blocked readers who used [[Adblock Plus]]—one of several computer programs that stop advertisements from being displayed in a [[web browser]]—from viewing the website. Fisher estimated 40% of the website's readers had the software installed at the time. The next day, the block was lifted, and the article "Why [[Ad blocking|Ad Blocking]] is devastating to the sites you love" was published on ''Ars Technica'', persuading readers not to use the software on websites they care about:<ref name=niemanlab/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Ken|title=Why Ad Blocking is devastating to the sites you love|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/03/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love/|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us}}</ref>

{{quote|text=...&nbsp;blocking ads can be devastating to the sites you love. I am not making an argument that blocking ads is a form of stealing, or is immoral, or unethical&nbsp;... It can result in people losing their jobs, it can result in less content on any given site, and it definitely can affect the quality of content. It can also put sites into a real advertising death spin.}}

The block and article were controversial, generating articles on other websites about them, and the broader issue of advertising ethics.<ref name=asay_abp/><ref name=wsj_abp/> Readers of ''Ars Technica'' generally followed Fisher's persuasion; the day after his article was published, 25,000 readers who used the software had allowed the display of advertisements on ''Ars Technica'' in their browser, and 200 readers had subscribed to Ars Premier.<ref name=niemanlab/>

In February 2016, Fisher noted, "That article lowered the ad-block rate by 12 percent, and what we found was that the majority of people blocking ads on our site were doing it because other sites were irritating them." In response to an increasing use of ad blockers, ''Ars Technica'' {{as of|2016|02|alt=intends to}} identify readers who filter out advertisements and ask them to support the site by several means.<ref name="NYT 2016 ad blocking"/>
