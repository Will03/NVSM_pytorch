==Architecture==
[[File:Mobile Cloud Architecture.jpg|thumb|right|Mobile cloud architecture]]
MCC uses computational augmentation approaches (computations are executed remotely instead of on the device) by which resource-constraint mobile devices can utilize computational resources of varied cloud-based resources.<ref name=":0" /> In MCC, there are four types of cloud-based resources, namely distant immobile clouds, proximate immobile computing entities, proximate mobile computing entities, and hybrid (combination of the other three model).<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Khan 42–49"/> Giant clouds such as Amazon EC2 are in the distant immobile groups whereas [[cloudlet]] or surrogates are member of proximate immobile computing entities. Smartphones, tablets, handheld devices, and wearable computing devices are part of the third group of cloud-based resources which is proximate mobile computing entities.<ref name="Khan 42–49"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernando|first=Niroshinie|author2=Seng W.

== Challenges ==
In the MCC landscape, an amalgam of mobile computing, cloud computing, and communication networks (to augment smartphones) creates several complex challenges such as Mobile Computation Offloading, Seamless Connectivity, Long WAN Latency, Mobility Management, Context-Processing, Energy Constraint, Vendor/data Lock-in, Security and Privacy,<ref name="Khan 753–776"/> Elasticity that hinder MCC success and adoption.<ref name="Khan 42–49"/><ref name="Sanaei 2013 1–24"/>

===Open research issues===
Although significant research and development in MCC is available in the literature, efforts in the following domains is still lacking:<ref name="mccsurvey"/><ref name="Sanaei 2013 1–24"/>
* '''Architectural issues: '''A reference architecture for heterogeneous MCC environment is a crucial requirement for unleashing the power of mobile computing towards unrestricted ubiquitous computing.
* '''Energy-efficient transmission: '''MCC requires frequent transmissions between cloud platform and mobile devices, due to the stochastic nature of wireless networks, the transmission protocol should be carefully designed.<ref>Peng Shu, Fangming Liu, Hai Jin, Min Chen, Feng Wen, Yupeng Qu, Bo Li, "[http://grid.hust.edu.cn/fmliu/infocom-etime.pdf eTime: Energy-Efficient Transmission between Cloud and Mobile Devices]", in Proc. of ''IEEE INFOCOM'' (Mini-conference), Italy, April, 2013.</ref><ref>Fangming Liu, Peng Shu, "[http://committees.comsoc.org/mmc/e-news/E-Letter-January13.pdf eTime: Energy-Efficient Mobile Cloud Computing for Rich-Media Applications]", ''IEEE COMSOC MMTC'' E-Letter (IEEE Communications Society, Multimedia Communications Technical Committee), vol. 8, no. 1, January 2013.</ref>
* '''Context-awareness issues: '''Context-aware and socially-aware computing are inseparable traits of contemporary handheld computers. To achieve the vision of mobile computing among heterogeneous converged networks and computing devices, designing resource-efficient environment-aware applications is an essential need.
* '''Live VM migration issues: '''Executing resource-intensive mobile application via Virtual Machine (VM) migration-based application offloading involves encapsulation of application in VM instance and migrating it to the cloud, which is a challenging task due to additional overhead of deploying and managing VM on mobile devices.
* '''Mobile communication congestion issues: '''Mobile data traffic is tremendously hiking by ever increasing mobile user demands for exploiting cloud resources which impact on mobile network operators and demand future efforts to enable smooth communication between mobile and cloud endpoints.
* '''Trust, security, and privacy issues:''' Trust is an essential factor for the success of the burgeoning MCC paradigm. It is because the data along with code/component/application/complete VM is offloaded to the cloud for execution. Moreover, just like software and mobile application piracy, the MCC application development models are also affected by the piracy issue.<ref name="Khan 753–776">{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=Atta ur Rehman|last2=Othman|first2=Mazliza|last3=Ali|first3=Mazhar|last4=Khan|first4=Abdul Nasir|last5=Madani|first5=Sajjad Ahmad|date=2013-12-01|title=Pirax: framework for application piracy control in mobile cloud environment|journal=The Journal of Supercomputing|language=en|volume=68|issue=2|pages=753–776|doi=10.1007/s11227-013-1061-1|issn=0920-8542}}</ref> Pirax<ref name="Khan 753–776"/> is known to be the first specialized framework for controlling application piracy in MCC requirements

==MCC research groups and activities==
