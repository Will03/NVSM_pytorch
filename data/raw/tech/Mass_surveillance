{{Global surveillance}}

'''Mass surveillance''' is the intricate [[surveillance]] of an entire or a substantial fraction of a population in order to monitor that group of citizens.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mass Surveillance |url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/node/52 |publisher=Privacy International |accessdate=20 April 2017}}</ref> The surveillance is often carried out by local and federal governments or [[intelligence agency|governmental organisations]], such as organizations like the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], but it may also be carried out by corporations (either on behalf of governments or at their own initiative). Depending on each nation's laws and judicial systems, the legality of and the permission required to engage in mass surveillance varies. It is the single most indicative distinguishing trait of [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]]. It is also often distinguished from [[targeted surveillance]].

Mass surveillance has often been cited as necessary to fight [[terrorism]], prevent [[crime]] and [[social unrest]], protect [[national security]], and control the population. Conversely, mass surveillance has equally often been criticized for violating [[privacy]] rights, limiting [[Civil and political rights|civil and political rights and freedoms]], and being illegal under some legal or constitutional systems. Another criticism is that increasing mass surveillance could lead to the development of a [[#Surveillance state|surveillance state]] or an [[#Electronic police state|electronic police state]] where civil liberties are infringed or political dissent is undermined by [[COINTELPRO]]-like programs. Such a state could be referred to as a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]].

==By country==
[[Privacy International]]'s 2007 survey, covering 47 countries, indicated that there had been an increase in surveillance and a decline in the performance of privacy safeguards, compared to the previous year. Balancing these factors, eight countries were rated as being 'endemic surveillance societies'. Of these eight, [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Russia]] scored lowest, followed jointly by [[Singapore]] and the [[United Kingdom]], then jointly by [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]] and the [[United States]]. The best ranking was given to [[Greece]], which was judged to have 'adequate safeguards against abuse'.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/reports/surveillance-monitor-2007-international-country-rankings |title=Surveillance Monitor 2007 - International country rankings |publisher=[[Privacy International]] |date=28 December 2007}}</ref>

Many countries throughout the world have already been adding thousands of surveillance cameras to their urban, suburban and even rural areas.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=9662 |title=Police Surveillance: Go Snoop, Yourself |author=Tom Steinert-Threlkeld |publisher=ZDNet |date=13 August 2008}}</ref><ref name="yougov1">{{cite web |url=http://www.yougov.co.uk/extranets/ygarchives/content/pdf/TEL060101024_3.pdf |title=YouGov / Daily Telegraph Survey Results |year=2006 |publisher=YouGov |accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref> For example, in September 2007 the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) stated that we are "in danger of tipping into a genuine surveillance society completely alien to American values" with "the potential for a dark future where our every move, our every transaction, our every communication is recorded, compiled, and stored away, ready to be examined and used against us by the authorities whenever they want."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/why-surveillance-society-clock |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |title= Why a Surveillance Society Clock? |date=4 September 2007 |accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref>

On 12 March 2013, [[Reporters Without Borders]] published a ''Special report on Internet Surveillance''. The report included a list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Five countries were placed on the initial list: [[Bahrain]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and [[Vietnam]].<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013>[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831072750/http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ |date=31 August 2013 }}, Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013</ref>

===Bahrain===
[[Bahrain]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. The level of Internet filtering and surveillance in Bahrain is one of the highest in the world. The royal family is represented in all areas of Internet management and has sophisticated tools at its disposal for spying on its subjects. The online activities of dissidents and news providers are closely monitored and the surveillance is increasing.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>

===China===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in China}}
[[China]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. All Internet access in China is owned or controlled by the state or the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]. Many foreign journalists in China have said that they take for granted that their telephones are tapped and their email is monitored.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>

The tools put in place to filter and monitor the Internet are collectively known as the [[Great Firewall of China]]. Besides the usual routing regulations that allow access to an IP address or a particular domain name to be blocked, the Great Firewall makes large-scale use of [[Deep Packet Inspection]] (DPI) technology to monitor and block access based on keyword detection. The Great Firewall has the ability to dynamically block encrypted connections. One of the country's main ISPs, [[China Unicom]], automatically cuts a connection as soon as it is used to transmit encrypted content.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>

The monitoring system developed by China is not confined to the Great Firewall, monitoring is also built into social networks, chat services and VoIP. Private companies are directly responsible to the Chinese authorities for surveillance of their networks to ensure banned messages are not circulated. The QQ application, owned by the firm Tencent, allows the authorities to monitor in detail exchanges between Internet users by seeking certain keywords and expressions. The author of each message can be identified by his or her user number. The QQ application is effectively a giant Trojan horse. And since March 2012, new legislation requires all new users of micro-blogging sites to register using their own name and telephone number.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>

[[Skype]], one of the world's most popular Internet telephone platforms, is closely monitored. Skype services in China are available through a local partner, the TOM media group. The Chinese-language version of Skype, known as [[TOM-Skype]], is slightly different from the downloadable versions in other countries. A report by [[OpenNet Initiative|OpenNet Initiative Asia]]<ref>[http://www.oni-asia.net/ ONI Asia], web site, OpenNet Initiative, retrieved 15 September 2013.</ref> says everyday conversations are captured on servers. Interception and storage of a conversation may be triggered by a sender's or recipient's name or by keywords that occur in the conversation.<ref>[http://www.nartv.org/mirror/breachingtrust.pdf "Breaching Trust: An analysis of surveillance and security practices on China's TOM-Skype platform"], Nart Villeneuve, Information Warfare Monitor and ONI Asia, 1 October 2008.</ref>

On 30 January, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that it had been the target of attacks by the Chinese government. The first breach took place on 13 September 2012 when the newspaper was preparing to publish an article about the fortune amassed by the family of outgoing Prime Minister [[Wen Jiabao]]. The newspaper said the purpose of attacks was to identify the sources that supplied the newspaper with information about corruption among the prime minister's entourage. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[CNN]]'' also said they had been the targets of cyber attacks from China. In February, [[Twitter]] disclosed that the accounts of some 250,000 subscribers had been the victims of attacks from China similar to those carried out on the ''New York Times''. Mandiant, the company engaged by the NYT to secure its network, identified the source of the attacks as a group of hackers it called Advanced Persistent Threat 1, a unit of the People's Liberation Army operating from a 12-story building in the suburbs of Shanghai that had hundreds, possibly thousands, of staff and the direct support of the Chinese government.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>

The newest form of mass surveillance in China is the [[Social Credit System]], where citizens and businesses are given or deducted good behavior points depending on their choices.

===East Germany===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in East Germany}}
Before the Digital Revolution, one of the world's biggest mass surveillance operations was carried out by the [[Stasi]], the [[secret police]] of the former [[East Germany]]. By the time the state collapsed in 1989, the Stasi had built up an estimated civilian network of 300,000 informants (approximately one in fifty of the population), who monitored even minute hints of political dissent among other citizens. Many [[West Germany|West Germans]] visiting friends and family in East Germany were also subject to Stasi spying, as well as many high-ranking West German politicians and persons in the public eye.

Most East German citizens were well aware that their government was spying on them, which led to a culture of mistrust: touchy political issues were only discussed in the comfort of their own four walls and only with the closest of friends and family members, while widely maintaining a façade of unquestioning followership in public.

===European Union===
The right to [[privacy]] is a highly developed area of law in Europe. The [[Data Protection Directive]] regulates the processing of personal data within the [[European Union]]. For comparison, the US has no data protection law that is comparable to this; instead, the US regulates data protection on a sectoral basis.<ref>See Julia M. Fromholz, The European Union Data Privacy Directive, 15 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 471, 472 (2000); Dean William Harvey & Amy White, The Impact of Computer Security Regulation on American Companies, 8 Tex. Wesleyan L. Rev. 505 (2002); Kamaal Zaidi, Harmonizing U.S.-EU Online Privacy Law: Toward a U.S. Comprehensive Regime For the Protection of Personal Data, 12 Mich.St. J. Int’l L. 169 (2003).</ref>

Since early 2012, the European Union has been working on a [[General Data Protection Regulation]] to replace the [[Data Protection Directive]] and harmonise data protection and privacy law. On 20 October 2013, a committee at the [[European Parliament]] backed the measure, which, if it is enacted, could require American companies to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The vote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|revelations about a far-reaching spying program]] by the [[U.S. National Security Agency]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/business/international/eu-panel-backs-plan-to-shield-online-data.html "Rules Shielding Online Data From N.S.A. and Other Prying Eyes Advance in Europe"], James Kanter and Mike Scott, ''New York Times'', 21 October 2013. Retrieved 22 October 2013.</ref> European Union justice and rights commissioner Viviane Reding said "The question has arisen whether the large-scale collection and processing of personal information under US surveillance programmes is necessary and proportionate to meet the interests of national security." The EU is also asking the US for changes to US legislation to match the legal redress offered in Europe; American citizens in Europe can go to the courts if they feel their rights are infringed but Europeans without right of residence in America cannot.<ref>{{cite news|last=Traynor|first=Ian|title=NSA surveillance: Europe threatens to freeze US data-sharing arrangements|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/nsa-surveillance-europe-threatens-freeze-us-data-sharing|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 November 2013}}</ref> When the EU / US arrangement to implement [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] were struck down by the European Court of Justice, a new framework for transatlantic data flows, called the "EU-US Privacy Shield", was adopted in July 2016.<ref>{{cite press release|title=EU Commission and United States agree on new framework for transatlantic data flows: EU-US Privacy Shield|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-216_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=2 February 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite press release|title=Restoring trust in transatlantic data flows through strong safeguards: European Commission presents EU-U.S. Privacy Shield|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-433_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 March 2016|date=29 February 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite press release|title=European Commission launches EU-U.S. Privacy Shield: stronger protection for transatlantic data flows|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2461_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 July 2016|date=12 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. and Europe in ‘Safe Harbor’ Data Deal, but Legal Fight May Await|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/technology/us-europe-safe-harbor-data-deal.html?_r=0|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=New York Times|date=2 February 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Privacy Shield deal lets US tech firms transfer European customers' data again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/08/privacy-shield-data-transfer-us-european-union|accessdate=8 July 2016|work=The Guardian|date=8 July 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Privacy Shield forced US to be ‘transparent’ about intelligence agencies|url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/privacy-shield-forced-us-to-be-transparent-about-intelligence-agencies/|work=EurActiv|accessdate=16 July 2016|date=12 July 2016}}</ref>

===Iran===
[[Iran]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in naturally active efforts to news providers . The government runs or controls almost all of the country's institutions for regulating, managing or legislating on telecommunications. The Supreme Council for Cyberspace, which was headed by [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|President Ahmadinejad]], was established in March 2012 and now determines digital policy. The construction of a parallel "Iranian Internet", with a high connection speed but fully monitored and censored, is almost complete.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>

The tools used by the Iranian authorities to monitor and control the Internet include data interception tools capable of [[Deep Packet Inspection]]. Interception products from leading Chinese companies such as [[ZTE]] and [[Huawei]] are in use. The products provided by Huawei to [[Mobin Net]], the leading national provider of mobile broadband, can be used to analyze email content, track browsing history and block access to sites. The products that ZTA sold to the [[Telecommunication Company of Iran]] (TCI) offer similar services plus the possibility of monitoring the mobile network. European companies are the source of other spying and data analysis tools. Products designed by [[Ericsson]] and [[Nokia Solutions and Networks|Nokia Siemens Networks]] (later Trovicor) are in use.

The use of Israeli surveillance devices has also been detected in Iran. The network traffic management and surveillance device NetEnforcer was provided by Israel to Denmark and then resold to Iran. Similarly, US equipment has found its way to Iran via the Chinese company ZTE.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>

===Malaysia===

In July 2018, the Malaysian police announced the creation of the Malaysian Internet Crime Against Children Investigation Unit (Micac) that is equipped with real-time mass internet surveillance software developed in the United States and is tasked with the monitoring of all Malaysian internet users, with a focus on pornography and child pornography. The system creates a "data library" of users which includes details such as IP addresses, websites, locations, duration and frequency of use and files uploaded and downloaded.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.malaymail.com/s/1650214/watching-porn-cops-now-have-their-eyes-on-you | title=Watching porn?

===Mexico===
After struggling with drug trafficking and criminal groups for decades Mexico has been strengthening their military mass surveillance. Approximately half of the population in Mexico does not support democracy as a form of government, and believe an authoritarian system is better if social matters are solved through it.<ref>Arteaga, Nelson. 2017. Mexico: Internal security, surveillance, and authoritarianism. Surveillance & Society 15(3/4): 491-495.</ref> The relevance of these political beliefs may make it easier for mass surveillance to take spread within the country. "This does not necessarily mean the end of democratic institutions as a whole—such as free elections or the permanence of critical mass media—but it means strengthening the mechanisms for exercising power that exclude dialogue, transparency and social agreement."<ref>Arteaga, Nelson. 2017. Mexico: Internal security, surveillance, and authoritarianism. Surveillance & Society 15(3/4): 491-495.(Artega, 494)</ref> Developing intelligence agencies has been on Mexico's radar for a while for means of security. 

===Netherlands===
According to a 2004 report, the government of the Netherlands carries out more clandestine wire-taps and intercepts than any country, per capita, in the world.<ref name="Italy and the Netherlands top wiretaps chart. EDRi-gram 15 July 2004 from EDRI.org">[https://edri.org/edrigramnumber2-14wiretap/ "Italy and the Netherlands top wiretap chart"], Digital Civil Rights in Europe, EDRI-gram Number 2.14, 15 July 2004.

===North Korea===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in North Korea}}
Having attained the nickname ‘surveillance state’, North Korea's government has complete control over all forms of telecommunications and Internet.  It is routine to be sent to a prison camp for communicating with the outside world. The government enforces restrictions around the types of appliances North Koreans may own in their home, in case radio or TV sets pick up signals from nearby South Korea, China and Russia.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/north-korea-surveillance-state-prison-camp-internet-phone-technology | title=North Korea, the surveillance state}}</ref> There is no attempt to mask the way this government actively spies on their citizens. In North Korea, an increasing number of citizens do have smartphones. However, these devices are heavily controlled and are being used to censor and observe everything North Koreans do on their phones. Reuters reported in 2015 that Koryolink, North Korea's official mobile phone network, has around 3 million subscribers in a country of 24 million. Obviously, in order to have digital data to draw from, the citizens must have access to phones and other things online.

===Russia===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in Russia}}
The [[SORM]] (and SORM-2) laws enable complete monitoring of any [[communication]], [[Telecommunication|electronic]] or traditional, by eight state agencies, without warrant. These laws seem to be in conflict with Article 23 of the [[Constitution of Russia]] which states:<ref name="1993const">[http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-03.htm "Chapter 2. Rights and Freedoms of Man And Citizen"], ''Constitution of Russia''. Retrieved 17 September 2013.</ref>

===Singapore===
[[Singapore]] is known as a city of sensors. Singapore's surveillance structure spreads widely from [[Closed-circuit television]] in public areas even around the neighbourhood, internet monitoring/ traffic monitoring and to the use of surveillance [[metadata]] for government initiatives. In [[Singapore]], SIM card registration is mandatory even for prepaid card. Singapore's government have the rights to access communication data. Singapore's largest telecompany, [[Singtel]], has close relations to the government and Singapore's laws are broadly phrased to allow the government to obtain sensitive data such as text-messages, email, call logs and web surfing history from its people without the need for court permission.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-advanced-surveillance-state-citizens-mind | title=Tech in Asia - Connecting Asia's startup ecosystem}}</ref>

In 2018, the [[Singapore]] government would be rolling out new and more advanced surveillance systems. Starting with Singapore's maritime borders, new panoramic electro-optic sensors will be put in place on the north and south coasts, monitoring a 360-degree view of the area.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/bevy-of-cameras-high-tech-sensors-to-secure-shoreline | title=Bevy of cameras, high-tech sensors to secure shoreline| date=2016-03-18}}</ref> A tethered [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) will also be operational, which can be used during search and rescue operations including hostage situations and public order incidents.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-drones-command-vehicles-to-help-police-fight-crime-better-9819786 | title=New drones, command vehicles to help police fight crime better}}</ref>

===Syria===
[[Syria]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Syria has stepped up its web censorship and cyber-monitoring as the [[Syrian civil war|country's civil war]] has intensified. At least 13 [[Blue Coat Systems|Blue Coat proxy servers]] are in use, [[Skype]] calls are intercepted, and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering techniques]], [[phishing]], and [[malware]] attacks are all in use.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>

===Turkey===
The failed coup attempt June 15, 2016 led to an authoritarian shift that uses mass surveillance to suppress opposite views. Digital surveillance is part of everyday life due to the box the government puts the Turkish citizens in. It is increasingly difficult to release any academic knowledge beyond what the Turkish government wants to be released. They have a digital and physical strong hold over any knowledge that goes against their regime. Today, the surveillance of academicians goes along with the state's oppression in Turkey. It is hard to say what will happen in the next few years in Turkey as they become increasingly more authoritarian. The centralization of state power along with digitalization expands the scope of the state surveillance. The digitalization and the centralization of state power are closely related to the regime of power that becomes prominent in this conjuncture.<ref name="State vs. Academy 550-556">2017. State vs. Academy in Turkey: Academy Under Surveillance. Surveillance & Society 15(3/4): 550-556.</ref>  National security and terrorism are Turkey's main explanations to the world on this topic, although there is clearly more happening there. According to the report of Human Rights Joint Platform published on February 23, 2017, during the nine months period of the state of emergency, the number of dismissed academicians reached 4,811, increasing to 7,619 with the addition of academicians who were working in the universities closed after the failed coup attempt.<ref name="State vs. Academy 550-556"/> The extended surveillance in Turkey helped them to control the population at a massive scale.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article |Mass surveillance in the United Kingdom}}

State surveillance in the [[United Kingdom]] has formed part of the public consciousness since the 19th century. The postal espionage crisis of 1844 sparked the first panic over the privacy of citizens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/surveillance-privacy-and-history|title=Surveillance, privacy and history|last=Vincent|first=David|date=1 October 2013|website=History & Policy|publisher=History & Policy|access-date=27 July 2016}}</ref> However, in the 20th century, electronic surveillance capabilities grew out of wartime [[signal intelligence]] and pioneering [[code breaking]].<ref>{{cite news|title=How the British and Americans started listening in|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35491822|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=BBC|date=8 February 2016}}</ref> In 1946, the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) was formed. The United Kingdom and the United States signed the bilateral [[UKUSA Agreement]] in 1948. It was later broadened to include Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as cooperation with several "third-party" nations. This became the cornerstone of Western intelligence gathering and the "[[Special Relationship]]" between the UK and the USA.<ref name="timecoldwar">{{cite journal|last=Adam White|title=How a Secret Spy Pact Helped Win the Cold War|journal=Time|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2000262,00.html|date=29 June 2010}}</ref>

After the growth of the Internet and development of the [[World Wide Web]], a series of [[2013 Global surveillance disclosure|media reports in 2013]] revealed more recent programs and techniques involving GCHQ, such as [[Tempora]].<ref>{{cite news|title=US and Britain team up on mass surveillance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/22/nsa-leaks-britain-us-surveillance|accessdate=13 May 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 June 2013}}</ref>

The use of these capabilities is controlled by laws made in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]. In particular, access to the content of private messages (that is, interception of a communication) must be authorized by a warrant signed by a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Andrew Marr Show Interview: Theresa May, MP Home Secretary|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/2311201402.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2014|publisher=BBC|date=23 November 2014|quote=Well I guess what he’s talking about is the fact that for certain aspects and certain of the more intrusive measures that our security service and police have available to them – i.e. Intercept, intercepting people’s telephones and some other intrusive measures – the decision is taken by the Secretary of State, predominantly me. A significant part of my job is looking at these warrants and signing these warrants. I think it’s ...

Many advanced nation-states have implemented laws that partially protect citizens from unwarranted intrusion, such as the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and [[Data Protection Act 1998]] in the United Kingdom, and laws that require a formal warrant before private data may be gathered by a government.

The UK is a member of the [[European Union]], participates in its programs, and is subject to [[Mass surveillance#European Union|EU policies and directives on surveillance]].

The vast majority of video surveillance cameras in the UK are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses.

{{NSA surveillance}}

Historically, mass surveillance was used as part of wartime censorship to control communications that could damage the war effort and aid the enemy. For example, during the world wars, every international telegram from or to the United States sent through companies such as [[Western Union]] was reviewed by the US military. After the wars were over, surveillance continued in programs such as the [[Black Chamber]] following World War I and [[Project SHAMROCK|project Shamrock]] following World War II.<ref>[[James Bamford]] (2008), ''[[The Shadow Factory]]'', Doubleday, {{ISBN|0-385-52132-4}}, Chapter 'Shamrock', especially pg. 163.</ref> [[COINTELPRO]] projects conducted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) between 1956 and 1971 targeted various "subversive" organizations, including peaceful anti-war and racial equality activists such as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr]].

Billions of dollars per year are spent, by agencies such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]], [[Echelon (signals intelligence)|ECHELON]], and [[NarusInsight]] to intercept and analyze the immense amount of data that traverses the Internet and telephone system every day.<ref name="zdnet-fbi">{{cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/fbi-turns-to-broad-new-wiretap-method/151059  |title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method |last=McCullagh |first=Declan |date=30 January 2007 |work=ZDNet News|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>

Since the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], a vast domestic intelligence apparatus has been built to collect information using the NSA, FBI, local police, state homeland security offices and military criminal investigators.

Counter-Mapping Surveillance: A Critical Cartography of Mass Surveillance Technology After Snowden.

Such revelations allow critical commentators to raise questions and scrutinize the implementation, use, and abuse of networking technologies, devices, and software systems that partake in a “global surveillant assemblage” (Bogard 2006; Collier and Ong 2004; Haggerty and Ericson 2000; Murakami Wood 2013).<ref name="van der Vlist 137-157"/>  The NSA collected millions of Verizon user's telephone records in between 2013-2014. The NSA also collected data through Google and Facebook with a program called 'Prism'. Journalists through Snowden published nearly 7,000 top-secret documents since then, yet the information disclosed seems to be less than 1% of the entire information. Having access to every individual's private records seems to directly contradict the fourth amendment. 

===Vietnam===
[[Vietnam]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Most of the country's 16 service providers are directly or indirectly controlled by the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]]. The industry leader, [[Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group]], which controls 74 per cent of the market, is state-owned. So is [[Viettel Mobile|Viettel]], an enterprise of the [[Ministry of Defence (Vietnam)|Vietnamese armed forces]]. FPT Telecom is a private firm, but is accountable to the Party and depends on the market leaders for bandwidth.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>

Service providers are the major instruments of control and surveillance. Bloggers monitored by the government frequently undergo [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s. These are designed to intercept data meant to be sent to secure (https) sites, allowing passwords and other communication to be intercepted.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/> According to a July 2012 [[Freedom House]] report, 91 percent of survey respondents connected to the Internet on their mobile devices and the government monitors conversations and tracks the calls of "activists" or "reactionaries."<ref>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Safety%20on%20the%20Line%20vFINAL.pdf "Country Report: Socialist Republic of Vietnam"], ''Safety on the Line'', Cormac Callanan and Hein Dries-Ziekenheiner, Freedom House, July 2012.

==Commercial mass surveillance==
{{Further information|Mass surveillance industry}}
As a result of the [[digital revolution]], many aspects of life are now captured and stored in digital form. Concern has been expressed that governments may use this information to conduct mass surveillance on their populations. Commercial mass surveillance often makes use of [[copyright]] laws and "[[Clickwrap|user agreements]]" to obtain (typically uninformed) 'consent' to surveillance from consumers who use their software or other related materials. This allows gathering of information which would be technically illegal if performed by government agencies. This data is then often shared with government agencies - thereby - in practice - defeating the purpose of such privacy protections.

One of the most common forms of mass surveillance is carried out by commercial organizations. Many people are willing to join supermarket and grocery [[loyalty card]] programs, trading their personal information and surveillance of their shopping habits in exchange for a discount on their groceries, although base prices might be increased to encourage participation in the program.

Through programs like [[Google]]'s [[AdSense]], [[OpenSocial]] and their increasing pool of so-called "web gadgets", "social gadgets" and other Google-hosted services many web sites on the Internet are effectively feeding user information about sites visited by the users, and now also their social connections, to Google. [[Facebook]] also keep this information, although its acquisition is limited to page views within Facebook. This data is valuable for authorities, advertisers and others interested in profiling users, trends and web site marketing performance. Google, Facebook and others are increasingly becoming more guarded about this data as their reach increases and the data becomes more all inclusive, making it more valuable.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/05/15/he-said-she-said-in-google-v-facebook/ |title=He Said, She Said In Google v.

New features like [[geolocation]] give an even increased admission of monitoring capabilities to large service providers like Google, where they also are enabled to track one's physical movements while users are using mobile devices, especially those which are syncing without any user interaction. Google's [[Gmail]] service is increasingly employing features to work as a stand-alone application which also might activate while a web browser is not even active for synchronizing; a feature mentioned on the [[Google I/O]] 2009 developer conference while showing the upcoming [[HTML5]] features which Google and others are actively defining and promoting.<ref>{{cite conference |title="Google's HTML 5 Work: What's Next?"

At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on 16 February 2010, Google presented their vision of a new business model for mobile operators and trying to convince mobile operators to embrace [[location-based service]]s and advertising.

==Surveillance state==
A surveillance state is a country where the government engages in pervasive surveillance of large numbers of its citizens and visitors. Such widespread surveillance is usually justified as being necessary for [[national security]], such as to prevent crime or acts of terrorism, but may also be used to stifle criticism of and opposition to the government.

Retrieved 23 September 2013.</ref> But these states did not have today's technologies for mass surveillance, such as the use of [[database]]s and [[pattern recognition]] software to cross-correlate information obtained by [[wire tapping]], including [[speech recognition]] and telecommunications [[traffic analysis]], monitoring of financial transactions, [[automatic number plate recognition]], the tracking of the position of mobile telephones, and [[facial recognition system]]s and the like which recognize people by their appearance, [[Gait (human)|gait]], [[DNA profiling]], etc.

===Smart cities===
{{Main article|Smart city}}

The development of smart cities has seen the increased adoption of surveillance technologies by governments, although the primary purpose of surveillance in such cities is to [[Smart city#Characteristics|use information and communication technologies]] to improve the urban environment. The implementation of such technology by [[Smart city#Flagship cases|a number of cities]] has resulted in increased efficiencies in urban infrastructure as well as improved community participation. Sensors and systems monitor a smart city's infrastructure, operations and activities and aim to help it run more efficiently. For example, the city could use less electricity; its traffic run more smoothly with fewer delays; its citizens use the city with more safety; hazards can be dealt with faster; citizen infractions of rules can be prevented, and the city's infrastructure; power distribution and roads with traffic lights for example, dynamically adjusted to respond to differing circumstances.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/09/07/smart_cities_are_surveillance_cities/ | title=Smart cities? Tell it like it is, they're surveillance cities}}</ref>

The development of smart city technology has also led to an increase in potential unwarranted [[Surveillance issues in smart cities#Privacy and autonomy|intrusions into privacy and restrictions upon autonomy]]. The widespread incorporation of information and communication technologies within the daily life of urban residents results in increases in the [[Surveillance issues in smart cities#Panopticism|surveillance capacity of states]] - to the extent that individuals may be unaware of what information is being accessed, when the access occurs and for what purpose. It is possible that such conditions could give rise to the [[Surveillance issues in smart cities#Police state|development of an electronic police state]]. Shanghai, Amsterdam, San Jose, Dubai, Barcelona, Madrid, Stockholm, and New York are all cities that use various techniques from smart city technology.

An electronic [[police state]] is a [[State (polity)|state]] in which the government aggressively uses electronic technologies to record, collect, store, organize, analyze, search, and distribute information about its citizens.<ref>The first use of the term "electronic police state" was likely in a posting by Jim Davis {{cite journal |date=11 August 1994 |url=http://cu-digest.org/CUDS6/cud6.72 |title=Police Checkpoints on the Information Highway |journal=Computer Underground Digest |volume=6 |issue=72 |issn=1066-632X |quote=The so-called 'electronic frontier' is quickly turning into an electronic police state.}}</ref><ref name=EPS-2008NationalRankings>The term "electronic police state" became more widely known with the publication of [https://secure.cryptohippie.com/pubs/EPS-2008.pdf ''The Electronic Police State: 2008 National Rankings''], by Jonathan Logan, Cryptohippie USA.</ref> Electronic police states also engage in mass government surveillance of [[landline]] and [[cellular phone|cellular]] telephone traffic, mail, email, web surfing, Internet searches, radio, and other forms of electronic communication as well as widespread use of video surveillance. The information is usually collected in secret.

The crucial elements are not politically based, so long as the government can afford the technology and the populace will permit it to be used, an electronic police state can form. The continual use of electronic mass surveillance can result in constant low-level fear within the population, which can lead to [[self-censorship]] and exerts a powerful coercive force upon the populace.<ref name="Applications of Social Control Theory: Criminality and Governmentality">Kingsley Ufuoma OMOYIBO, Ogaga Ayemo OBARO (2012), [http://www.pdoaj.com/pdf-files/ijass,%20pp.1026-1032.pdf "Applications of Social Control Theory: Criminality and Governmentality"], ''International Journal of Asian Social Science'', Vol. 2, No. 7, pp.1026-1032.</ref>

Seventeen factors for judging the development of an electronic police state were suggested in ''The Electronic Police State: 2008 National Rankings'':<ref name=EPS-2008NationalRankings/>
* '''Daily documents''': Requirement for the use and tracking of state-issued [[identity document]]s and registration.
* '''Border and travel control''': Inspections at borders, searching computers and cell phones, demanding decryption of data, and tracking travel within as well as to and from a country.
* '''Financial tracking''': A state's ability to record and search [[financial transaction]]s: checks, credit cards, wires, etc.
* '''Gag orders''': Restrictions on and criminal penalties for the disclosure of the existence of state surveillance programs.
* '''Anti-crypto laws''': Outlawing or restricting [[cryptography]] and/or privacy enhancing technologies.
* '''Lack of constitutional protections''': A lack of constitutional privacy protections or the routine overriding of such protections.
* '''Data storage''': The ability of the state to store the data gathered.
* '''Data search''': The ability to organize and search the data gathered.
* '''Data retention requirements''': Laws that require Internet and other service providers to save detailed records of their customers’ Internet usage for a minimum period of time.
** '''Telephone data retention requirements''': Laws that require telephone companies to record and save records of their customers’ telephone usage.
** '''Cell phone data retention requirements''': Laws that require cellular telephone companies to record and save records of their customers’ usage and location.
* '''Medical records''': Government access to the records of medical service providers.
* '''Enforcement''': The state's ability to use force to seize anyone they want, whenever they want.
* '''Lack of ''habeas corpus''''': Lack of a [[Habeas corpus|right for a person under arrest to be brought before a judge or into court]] in a timely fashion or the overriding of such rights.
* '''Lack of a police-intel barrier''': The lack of a barrier between police organizations and intelligence organizations, or the overriding of such barriers.
* '''Covert hacking''': State operatives collecting, removing, or adding digital evidence to/from private computers without permission or the knowledge of the computers' owners.
* '''Loose or no warrants''': Arrests or searches made without warrants or without careful examination and review of police statements and justifications by a truly independent judge or other third-party.

The list includes factors that apply to other forms of [[Police State|police states]], such as the use of identity documents and police enforcement, but go considerably beyond them and emphasize the use of technology to gather and process the information collected.

==In popular culture==
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in popular culture}}
The concept of being monitored by our government collects a large audience of curious citizens. Mass surveillance has been prominently featured in a wide array of books, films, and other media. Advances in technology over the last century have led to possible social control through the Internet and the conditions of late capitalism. Many directors and writers have been enthralled with the potential stories that could come from mass surveillance. Perhaps the most iconic example of fictional mass surveillance is [[George Orwell]]'s 1949 novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', which depicts a [[dystopia]]n surveillance state. 

Here are a few other works that focus on mass surveillance:
* ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' , a 1920 novel by Russian author [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]] , that predates ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and was read by its author [[George Orwell]].
* ''[[Little Brother (Doctorow novel)|Little Brother]]'' is a novel by [[Cory Doctorow]], and is set in San Francisco after a major terrorist attack. The DHS uses technologies such as RFIDs and surveillance cameras to create a totalitarian system of control.
* ''[[The Lives of Others]]'', is a 2006 German drama film, which movingly conveys the impact that relentless surveillance has on the emotional well-being and the outcome of individuals subjected to it.
* ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' by [[Suzanne Collins]] is a trilogy in which ‘the capital’ has totalitarian surveillance & control over all aspects of the other ‘districts’.
* ''[[Digital Fortress]]'', novel by [[Dan Brown]], involving an NSA code breaking machine called 'TRANSLTR'. The machine read and decrypted email messages, with which the NSA used to foil terrorist attacks and mass murders.
