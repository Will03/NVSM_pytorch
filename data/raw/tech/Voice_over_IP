'''Voice over Internet Protocol''' ('''VoIP'''), also called '''IP telephony''',  is a methodology and group of technologies for the delivery of [[speech|voice communication]]s and [[multimedia]] sessions over [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) networks, such as the [[Internet]]. The terms '''Internet telephony''', '''broadband telephony''', and '''broadband phone service''' specifically refer to the provisioning of communications services (voice, [[fax]], [[Short Message Service|SMS]], voice-messaging) over the public Internet, rather than via the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).

The steps and principles involved in originating VoIP telephone calls are similar to traditional digital [[telephony]] and involve signaling, channel setup, digitization of the analog voice signals, and encoding. Instead of being transmitted over a [[circuit-switched network]], the digital information is packetized, and transmission occurs as IP packets over a [[packet-switched network]]. They transport media streams using special media delivery protocols that encode audio and video with [[audio codec]]s, and [[video codec]]s. Various codecs exist that optimize the media stream based on application requirements and network bandwidth; some implementations rely on [[narrowband]] and [[Speech coding|compressed speech]], while others support [[high fidelity|high-fidelity]] stereo codecs. Some popular codecs include [[μ-law]] and [[A-law]] versions of [[G.711]], [[G.722]], an [[Open-source license|open source]] voice codec known as [[iLBC]], a codec that uses only 8&nbsp;kbit/s each way called [[G.729]], and many others.

Early providers of voice-over-IP services offered business models and technical solutions that mirrored the architecture of the legacy telephone network. Second-generation providers, such as [[Skype]], built closed networks for private user bases, offering the benefit of free calls and convenience while potentially charging for access to other communication networks, such as the PSTN. This limited the freedom of users to mix-and-match third-party hardware and software. Third-generation providers, such as [[Google Talk]], adopted the concept of [[federated VoIP]]—which is a departure from the architecture of the legacy networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2006/01/xmpp-federation.html|title=XMPP Federation|publisher=Google Talkabout|year=2006|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref> These solutions typically allow dynamic interconnection between users on any two domains on the Internet when a user wishes to place a call.

In addition to [[VoIP phone]]s, VoIP is also available on many personal computers and other Internet access devices. Calls and SMS text messages may be sent over [[mobile data]] or [[Wi-Fi]].<ref name=EBSCOhost>{{cite journal|last=Booth|first=C|title=Chapter 2: IP Phones, Software VoIP, and Integrated and Mobile VoIP|journal=Library Technology Reports|year=2010|volume=46|issue=5|pages=11–19}}</ref> VoIP allows modern communications technologies (including telephones, smartphones, voice and video conferencing, email, and presence detection) to be consolidated using a single [[unified communications]] system.<ref name=":0" /> 

==Pronunciation==
''VoIP'' is variously pronounced as an [[initialism]], ''V-O-I-P'', or as an [[acronym]] /ˈvɔɪp/ (''voyp''), as in ''voice''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/british/voip|title=VoIP|dictionary=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher= |location= |id= }}</ref> Full words, ''voice over Internet Protocol'', or ''voice over IP'', are sometimes used.

==Protocols==
Voice over IP has been implemented in various ways using both [[proprietary protocol]]s and protocols based on [[Open standard#Protocols|open standards]]. These protocols can be used by a [[VoIP phone]], special-purpose software, a mobile application or [[Web-based VoIP|integrated into a web page]]. VoIP protocols include:
* [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), connection management protocol developed by the IETF
* [[H.323]], one of the first VoIP call signaling and control protocols that found widespread implementation. Since the development of newer, less complex protocols such as MGCP and SIP, H.323 deployments are increasingly limited to carrying existing long-haul network traffic.{{cn|date=September 2017}}
* [[Media Gateway Control Protocol]] (MGCP), connection management for media gateways
* [[H.248]], control protocol for media gateways across a converged internetwork consisting of the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN) and modern packet networks
* [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP), transport protocol for real-time audio and video data
* [[Real-time Transport Control Protocol]] (RTCP), sister protocol for RTP providing stream statistics and status information
* [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol]] (SRTP), encrypted version of RTP
* [[Session Description Protocol]] (SDP), file format used principally by SIP to describe VoIP connections
* [[Inter-Asterisk eXchange]] (IAX), protocol used between VoIP servers
* [[XMPP|Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol]] (XMPP), instant messaging, presence information, and contact list maintenance
* [[Jingle (protocol)|Jingle]], adds peer-to-peer session control to XMPP
* [[Skype protocol]], proprietary Internet telephony protocol suite based on peer-to-peer architecture

==Adoption==

===Consumer market===
[[File:Voip-typical.gif|thumb|Example of residential network including VoIP]]
Mass-market VoIP services use existing [[broadband Internet access]], by which subscribers place and receive telephone calls in much the same manner as they would via the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN). Full-service VoIP phone companies provide inbound and outbound service with [[direct inbound dialing]]. Many offer unlimited domestic calling and sometimes international calls for a flat monthly subscription fee. Phone calls between subscribers of the same provider are usually free when flat-fee service is not available.

A VoIP phone is necessary to connect to a VoIP service provider. This can be implemented in several ways:
* Dedicated VoIP phones connect directly to the IP network using technologies such as wired [[Ethernet]] or [[Wi-Fi]]. These are typically designed in the style of traditional digital business telephones.
* An [[analog telephone adapter]] connects to the network and implements the electronics and firmware to operate a conventional analog telephone attached through a modular phone jack. Some residential Internet gateways and [[cablemodem]]s have this function built in.
* [[Softphone]] application software installed on a networked computer that is equipped with a microphone and speaker, or headset. The application typically presents a dial pad and display field to the user to operate the application by mouse clicks or keyboard input.

===PSTN and mobile network providers===
It is increasingly common for telecommunications providers to use VoIP telephony over dedicated and public IP networks as a [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]] to connect switching centers and to interconnect with other telephony network providers; this is often referred to as ''IP backhaul''.<ref>{{cite web|title=WIRELESS: Carriers look to IP for backhaul |url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4052152/WIRELESS-Carriers-look-to-IP-for-back-haul |website=www.eetimes.com |publisher=EE Times |accessdate=8 April 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809025050/http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4052152/WIRELESS-Carriers-look-to-IP-for-back-haul |archivedate=August 9, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mobile's IP challenge |url=http://www.totaltele.com/View.aspx?ID=77588&t=4 |website=www.totaltele.com |publisher=Total Telecom Online |accessdate=8 April 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217064211/http://www.totaltele.com/View.aspx?ID=77588&t=4 |archivedate=February 17, 2006 }}</ref>

[[Smartphones]] may have SIP clients built into the firmware or available as an application download.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.callcentric.com/support/device/android/sip_client |title=Android SIP Client |access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lifewire.com/apps-for-sip-on-android-3426471 |title=Learn to Make Free or Inexpensive Calls Using SIP on Android |access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref>

===Corporate use===
Because of the bandwidth efficiency and low costs that VoIP technology can provide, businesses are migrating from traditional copper-wire telephone systems to VoIP systems to reduce their monthly phone costs. In 2008, 80% of all new [[Private branch exchange]] (PBX) lines installed internationally were VoIP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.axiaaudio.com/tech/voip/default.htm|title=VoIP in the Broadcast Studio|author=Michael Dosch and Steve Church|publisher=Axia Audio|accessdate=2011-06-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007231611/http://www.axiaaudio.com/tech/voip/default.htm|archivedate=October 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> For example, in the United States, the [[Social Security Administration]] is converting its field offices of 63,000 workers from traditional phone installations to a VoIP infrastructure carried over its existing data network.<ref>{{cite web|first=William|last=Jackson|title=SSA goes big on VOIP|url=http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/06/01/SSA-VOIP-implementation.aspx?s=gcndaily_280509&Page=1|publisher=Government Computer News|date=May 27, 2009|accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Social Security to Build "World's Largest VOIP"|url=http://www.govtech.com/gt/275677|publisher=Government Technology|accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref>

VoIP allows both voice and data communications to be run over a single network, which can significantly reduce infrastructure costs. The prices of extensions on VoIP are lower than for PBX and key systems. VoIP switches may run on commodity hardware, such as [[personal computer]]s. Rather than closed architectures, these devices rely on standard interfaces.<ref name="Korzeniowski">{{cite journal |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/08/small-business-voip-ent-tech-cx_bm_0108bmightytech09.html/ |title=Three Technologies You Need In 2009 |date=January 8, 2009 |last=Korzeniowski |first=Peter |accessdate=2009-03-02 |journal=Forbes}}</ref> VoIP devices have simple, intuitive user interfaces, so users can often make simple system configuration changes. Dual-mode phones enable users to continue their conversations as they move between an outside cellular service and an internal [[Wi-Fi]] network, so that it is no longer necessary to carry both a desktop phone and a cell phone. Maintenance becomes simpler as there are fewer devices to oversee.<ref name="Korzeniowski"/>

VoIP solutions aimed at businesses have evolved into [[unified communications]] services that treat all communications—phone calls, faxes, voice mail, e-mail, web conferences, and more—as discrete units that can all be delivered via any means and to any handset, including cellphones. Two kinds of service providers are operating in this space: one set is focused on VoIP for medium to large enterprises, while another is targeting the small-to-medium business (SMB) market.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/12/09/skype-vonage-ringcentral_leadership_clayton_in_rc_1209claytonchristensen_inl.html |title= Businesses Move To Voice-Over-IP|date=December 9, 2008|last=Callahan|first=Renee|accessdate=2009-03-03|journal=Forbes}}</ref>

[[Skype]], which originally marketed itself as a service among friends, has begun to cater to businesses, providing free-of-charge connections between any users on the Skype network and connecting to and from ordinary [[PSTN]] telephones for a charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skype.com/business/allfeatures/3skypephone/|title=Skype For Business|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=skype.com}}</ref>

==Quality of service==
Communication on the IP network is perceived as less reliable in contrast to the circuit-switched public telephone network because it does not provide a network-based mechanism to ensure that data packets are not lost, and are delivered in sequential order. It is a best-effort network without fundamental [[Quality of Service]] (QoS) guarantees. Voice, and all other data, travels in packets over IP networks with fixed maximum capacity. This system may be more prone to data loss in the presence of congestion{{efn|IP networks may also be more prone to [[Denial-of-service attack|DoS attacks]] that cause congestion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.continuitycentral.com/feature074.htm|title=VoIP– Vulnerability over Internet Protocol?}}</ref>}} than traditional [[circuit switched]] systems; a circuit switched system of insufficient capacity will refuse new connections while carrying the remainder without impairment, while the quality of real-time data such as telephone conversations on packet-switched networks degrades dramatically.<ref name=cisco/> Therefore, VoIP implementations may face problems with [[latency (engineering)|latency]], packet loss, and [[jitter]].<ref name=cisco>{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/solutions_docs/qos_solutions/QoSVoIP/QoSVoIP.html|title=Quality of Service for Voice over IP|accessdate= May 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Prabhakar|first=G.|author2=Rastogi, R. |author3=Thotton, M |title=OSS Architecture & Requirements for VoIP Networks|journal=Bell Labs Technical Journal|year=2005|volume=10|issue=1|pages=31–45|doi=10.1002/bltj.20077}}</ref>

By default, network routers handle traffic on a first-come, first-served basis. Fixed delays cannot be controlled as they are caused by the physical distance the packets travel. They are especially problematic when satellite circuits are involved because of the long distance to a [[Geosynchronous satellite|geostationary satellite]] and back; delays of 400–600&nbsp;ms are typical. Latency can be minimized by marking voice packets as being delay-sensitive with QoS methods such as [[DiffServ]].<ref name=cisco/>

Network routers on high volume traffic links may introduce latency that exceeds permissible thresholds for VoIP. Excessive load on a link can cause congestion and associated [[queueing delay]]s, [[packet loss]]. This signals a transport protocol like [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] to reduce its transmission rate to alleviate the congestion. But VoIP usually uses [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] not TCP because recovering from congestion through retransmission usually entails too much latency.<ref name=cisco/> So QoS mechanisms can avoid the undesirable loss of VoIP packets by immediately transmitting them ahead of any queued bulk traffic on the same link, even when the link is congested by bulk traffic.

VoIP endpoints usually have to wait for completion of transmission of previous packets before new data may be sent. Although it is possible to preempt (abort) a less important packet in mid-transmission, this is not commonly done, especially on high-speed links where transmission times are short even for maximum-sized packets.<ref name=ciscoPacket>{{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/solutions_docs/qos_solutions/QoSVoIP/QoSVoIP.html#wp1029054 |title=Quality of Service for Voice over IP |accessdate=May 3, 2011}}</ref> An alternative to preemption on slower links, such as dialup and [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL), is to reduce the maximum transmission time by reducing the [[maximum transmission unit]]. But since every packet must contain protocol headers, this increases relative header overhead on every link traversed.<ref name=ciscoPacket/>

The receiver must resequence IP packets that arrive out of order and recover gracefully when packets arrive too late or not at all. [[Packet delay variation]] results from changes in [[queuing delay]] along a given network path due to competition from other users for the same transmission links. VoIP receivers accommodate this variation by storing incoming packets briefly in a [[playout buffer]], deliberately increasing latency to improve the chance that each packet will be on hand when it is time for the [[voice engine]] to play it. The added delay is thus a compromise between excessive latency and excessive [[Dropout (communications)|dropout]], i.e. momentary audio interruptions.

Although jitter is a random variable, it is the sum of several other random variables which are at least somewhat independent: the individual queuing delays of the routers along the Internet path in question. According to the [[central limit theorem]], jitter can be modeled as a [[gaussian random variable]]. This suggests continually estimating the mean delay and its standard deviation and setting the playout delay so that only packets delayed more than several standard deviations above the mean will arrive too late to be useful. In practice, the variance in latency of many Internet paths is dominated by a small number (often one) of relatively slow and congested "bottleneck" links. Most Internet backbone links are now so fast (e.g. 10&nbsp;Gbit/s) that their delays are dominated by the transmission medium (e.g. optical fiber) and the routers driving them do not have enough buffering for queuing delays to be significant. Some VoIP providers now offer fiber to the building (FTTB) in order to ensure the highest VoIP call quality, reliability, and service up-time.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.epiknetworks.com/what-is-voip/|title=What Is VoIP|last=Nespeca|first=Claudio|date=August 18, 2018|website=Epik Networks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref>

It has been suggested to rely on the packetized nature of media in VoIP communications and transmit the stream of packets from the source phone to the destination phone simultaneously across different routes (multi-path routing).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4520089|title=IEEE Multipath routing with adaptive playback scheduling for Voice over IP in Service Overlay Networks|doi=10.1109/SARNOF.2008.4520089|ISBN=978-1-4244-1843-5|journal=Sarnoff Symposium, 2008 IEEE|date=28–30 April 2008|pages=1–5}}</ref> In such a way, temporary failures have less impact on the communication quality. In [[capillary routing]] at the packet level [[Fountain code]]s or particularly [[raptor code]]s it is recommended for transmitting extra redundant packets making the communication more reliable.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

A number of protocols have been defined to support the reporting of [[quality of service]] (QoS) and [[quality of experience]] (QoE) for VoIP calls. These include [[RTP Control Protocol|RTCP]] Extended Report (RFC 3611), [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] RTCP Summary Reports, H.460.9 Annex B (for [[H.323]]), [[Media Gateway Control Protocol (Megaco)|H.248.30]] and [[Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP)|MGCP]] extensions. The RFC&nbsp;3611 VoIP Metrics block is generated by an IP phone or gateway during a live call and contains information on packet loss rate, packet discard rate (because of jitter), packet loss/discard burst metrics (burst length/density, gap length/density), network delay, end system delay, signal / noise / echo level, [[Mean Opinion Score]]s (MOS) and R factors and configuration information related to the jitter buffer.

RFC&nbsp;3611 VoIP metrics reports are exchanged between IP endpoints on an occasional basis during a call, and an end of call message sent via SIP RTCP Summary Report or one of the other signaling protocol extensions. RFC&nbsp;3611 VoIP metrics reports are intended to support real time feedback related to QoS problems, the exchange of information between the endpoints for improved call quality calculation and a variety of other applications.

Rural areas in particular are greatly hindered in their ability to choose a VoIP system over PBX. This is generally down to the poor access to superfast broadband in rural country areas. With the release of 4G data, there is a potential for corporate users based outside of populated areas to switch their internet connection to 4G data, which is comparatively as fast as a regular superfast broadband connection. This greatly enhances the overall quality and user experience of a VoIP system in these areas.

===DSL and ATM===
DSL modems provide Ethernet (or Ethernet over [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]) connections to local equipment, but inside they are actually [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) modems (Note: Non-ATM technologies such as [[802.3ah]] also provide this capability). They use [[ATM Adaptation Layer 5]] (AAL5) to segment each Ethernet packet into a series of 53-byte ATM cells for transmission, reassembling them back into Ethernet frames at the receiving end. A [[virtual circuit identifier]] (VCI) is part of the 5-byte header on every ATM cell, so the transmitter can [[multiplexing|multiplex]] the active virtual circuits (VCs) in any arbitrary order. Cells from the ''same'' VC are always sent sequentially.

A majority of DSL providers use only one VC for each customer, even those with bundled VoIP service. Every Ethernet frame must be completely transmitted before another can begin. If a second VC were established, given high priority and reserved for VoIP, then a low priority data packet could be suspended in mid-transmission and a VoIP packet sent right away on the high priority VC. Then the link would pick up the low priority VC where it left off. Because ATM links are multiplexed on a cell-by-cell basis, a high priority packet would have to wait at most 53 byte times to begin transmission. There would be no need to reduce the interface MTU and accept the resulting increase in higher layer protocol overhead, and no need to abort a low priority packet and resend it later.

ATM has substantial header overhead: 5/53 = 9.4%, roughly twice the total header overhead of a 1500 byte Ethernet frame. This "ATM tax" is incurred by every DSL user whether or not they take advantage of multiple virtual circuits&nbsp;-&nbsp;and few can.<ref name=cisco/>

ATM's potential for latency reduction is greatest on slow links, because worst-case latency decreases with increasing link speed. A full-size (1500 byte) Ethernet frame takes 94&nbsp;ms to transmit at 128&nbsp;kbit/s but only 8&nbsp;ms at 1.5&nbsp;Mbit/s. If this is the bottleneck link, this latency is probably small enough to ensure good VoIP performance without MTU reductions or multiple ATM VCs. The latest generations of DSL, [[VDSL]] and [[VDSL2]], carry Ethernet without intermediate ATM/AAL5 layers, and they generally support [[IEEE 802.1p]] priority tagging so that VoIP can be queued ahead of less time-critical traffic.<ref name=cisco/>

===Layer 2===
A number of protocols that deal with the [[data link layer]] and [[physical layer]] include quality-of-service mechanisms that can be used to ensure that applications like VoIP work well even in congested scenarios. Some examples include:
* [[IEEE 802.11e]] is an approved amendment to the [[IEEE 802.11]] standard that defines a set of quality-of-service enhancements for wireless LAN applications through modifications to the [[Media Access Control]] (MAC) layer. The standard is considered of critical importance for delay-sensitive applications, such as voice over wireless IP.
* [[IEEE 802.1p]] defines 8 different classes of service (including one dedicated to voice) for traffic on layer-2 wired [[Ethernet]].
* The [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 gigabit per second) [[Local area network]] (LAN) using existing home wiring ([[Power line communication|power lines]], phone lines and [[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]]). G.hn provides QoS by means of "Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities" (CFTXOPs) which are allocated to flows (such as a VoIP call) which require QoS and which have negotiated a "contract" with the network controllers.

==Performance metrics==
The quality of voice transmission is characterized by several metrics that may be monitored by network elements, by the user agent hardware or software. Such metrics include network [[packet loss]], packet [[jitter]], packet [[round-trip delay time|latency]] (delay), post-dial delay, and echo. The metrics are determined by VoIP performance testing and monitoring.<ref>CableLabs, ''PacketCable Residential SIP Telephony Feature Definition'', Technical Report, PKT-TR-RST-V03-071106 (2007)</ref><ref>{{cite web

==PSTN integration==
A VoIP media gateway controller (aka Class 5 Softswitch) works in cooperation with a media gateway (aka IP Business Gateway) and connects the digital media stream, so as to complete creating the path for voice as well as data media. They include the interfaces for connecting the standard PSTN networks with the ATM and Inter Protocol networks. The Ethernet interfaces are also included in the modern systems, which are specially designed to link calls that are passed via the VoIP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ixc.ua/importance-of-softswitch-voip-technology-properly|title=Importance of Softswitch VoIP Technology|publisher=ixc.ua|date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>

[[E.164]] is a global FGFnumbering standard for both the [[public switched telephone network|PSTN]] and [[Public land mobile network|PLMN]]. Most VoIP implementations support [[E.164]] to allow calls to be routed to and from VoIP subscribers and the PSTN/PLMN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.packetizer.com/rfc/rfc3824/|title=RFC 3824– Using E.164 numbers with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)|publisher=The Internet Society|date=June 1, 2004|accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref> VoIP implementations can also allow other identification techniques to be used. For example, Skype allows subscribers to choose "Skype names"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skype.com/help/guides/createskypename_windows/|title=Create a Skype Name|publisher=Skype|accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref> (usernames) whereas SIP implementations can use [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.packetizer.com/rfc/rfc3969/|title=RFC 3969– The Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Parameter Registry for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)|publisher=The Internet Society|date=December 1, 2004|accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref> similar to [[E-mail address|email addresses]]. Often VoIP implementations employ methods of translating non-E.164 identifiers to E.164 numbers and vice versa, such as the Skype-In service provided by Skype<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skype.com/allfeatures/onlinenumber/|title=Your personal online number|publisher=Skype|accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref> and the [[Telephone Number Mapping|ENUM]] service in IMS and SIP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipcommunications.tmcnet.com/hot-topics/MCP/articles/1311-application-level-network-interoperability-the-evolution-ims.htm|title=Application-level Network Interoperability and the Evolution of IMS|publisher=TMCnet.com|date=May 24, 2006|accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref>

Echo can also be an issue for PSTN integration.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeff Riddel|title=Packetcable Implementation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CNBbrxytcAC&pg=PA557|year=2007|publisher=Cisco Press|isbn=978-1-58705-181-4|page=557}}</ref> Common causes of echo include [[Impedance matching|impedance mismatches]] in analog circuitry and acoustic coupling of the transmit and receive signal at the receiving end.

===Number portability===
[[Local number portability]] (LNP) and [[mobile number portability]] (MNP) also impact VoIP business. In November 2007, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the United States released an order extending number portability obligations to interconnected VoIP providers and carriers that support VoIP providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/numbport.html|title=Keeping your telephone number when you change your service provider|work=FCC}}</ref> Number portability is a service that allows a subscriber to select a new telephone carrier without requiring a new number to be issued. Typically, it is the responsibility of the former carrier to "map" the old number to the undisclosed number assigned by the new carrier. This is achieved by maintaining a database of numbers. A dialed number is initially received by the original carrier and quickly rerouted to the new carrier. Multiple porting references must be maintained even if the subscriber returns to the original carrier. The FCC mandates carrier compliance with these consumer-protection stipulations.

A voice call originating in the VoIP environment also faces challenges to reach its destination if the number is routed to a mobile phone number on a traditional mobile carrier. VoIP has been identified in the past as a [[Least Cost Routing]] (LCR) system, which is based on checking the destination of each telephone call as it is made, and then sending the call via the network that will cost the customer the least. This rating is subject to some debate given the complexity of call routing created by number portability. With [[GSM]] number portability now in place, LCR providers can no longer rely on using the network root prefix to determine how to route a call. Instead, they must now determine the actual network of every number before routing the call.

Therefore, VoIP solutions also need to handle MNP when routing a voice call. In countries without a central database, like the UK, it might be necessary to query the [[GSM]] network about which home network a mobile phone number belongs to. As the popularity of VoIP increases in the enterprise markets because of [[least cost routing]] options, it needs to provide a certain level of reliability when handling calls.

MNP checks are important to assure that this quality of service is met. Handling MNP lookups before routing a call provides some assurance that the voice call will actually work.

===Emergency calls===
A telephone connected to a [[land line]] has a direct relationship between a telephone number and a physical location, which is maintained by the telephone company and available to emergency responders via the national emergency response service centers in form of emergency subscriber lists. When an emergency call is received by a center the location is automatically determined from its databases and displayed on the operator console.

In IP telephony, no such direct link between location and communications end point exists. Even a provider having hardware infrastructure, such as a DSL provider, may know only the approximate location of the device, based on the [[IP address]] allocated to the network router and the known service address. Some ISPs do not track the automatic assignment of IP addresses to customer equipment.<ref name=fcc>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/voip911.pdf|title=FCC Consumer Advisory VoIP and 911 Service|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref>

IP communication provides for device mobility. For example, a residential broadband connection may be used as a link to a [[virtual private network]] of a corporate entity, in which case the IP address being used for customer communications may belong to the enterprise, not being the IP address of the residential ISP. Such [[off-premises extension]]s may appear as part of an upstream IP PBX. On mobile devices, e.g., a 3G handset or USB wireless broadband adapter, the IP address has no relationship with any physical location known to the telephony service provider, since a mobile user could be anywhere in a region with network coverage, even roaming via another cellular company.

At the VoIP level, a phone or gateway may identify itself with a [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) registrar by its account credentials. In such cases, the [[Internet telephony service provider]] (ITSP) knows only that a particular user's equipment is active. Service providers often provide emergency response services by agreement with the user who registers a physical location and agrees that emergency services are provided to that address only if an emergency number is called from the IP device.

Such emergency services are provided by VoIP vendors in the United States by a system called [[Enhanced 911]] (E911), based on the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999. The VoIP E911 emergency-calling system associates a physical address with the calling party's telephone number. All VoIP providers that provide access to the public switched telephone network are required to implement E911,<ref name=fcc/> a service for which the subscriber may be charged. "VoIP providers may not allow customers to "opt-out" of 911 service."<ref name=fcc/>

The VoIP E911 system is based on a static table lookup. Unlike in cellular phones, where the location of an E911 call can be traced using [[assisted GPS]] or other methods, the VoIP E911 information is accurate only if subscribers, who have the legal responsibility, keep their emergency address information current.

==Fax support==
Sending faxes over VoIP networks is sometimes referred to as Fax over IP (FoIP). Transmission of fax documents was problematic in early VoIP implementations, as most voice digitization and compression [[codec]]s are optimized for the representation of the human voice and the proper timing of the modem signals cannot be guaranteed in a packet-based, connection-less network. A standards-based solution for reliably delivering fax-over-IP is the [[T.38]] protocol.

The T.38 protocol is designed to compensate for the differences between traditional packet-less communications over analog lines and packet-based transmissions which are the basis for IP communications. The fax machine may be a standard device connected to an [[analog telephone adapter]] (ATA), or it may be a software application or dedicated network device operating via an Ethernet interface.<ref>[http://soft-switch.org/foip.html Soft-Switch.org], Faxing over IP networks</ref> Originally, T.38 was designed to use UDP or TCP transmission methods across an IP network. UDP provides near real-time characteristics due to the "no recovery rule" when a UDP packet is lost or an error occurs during transmission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/kurose/transport/UDP.html|title=UMass Discussion on UDP transmission Characteristics}}</ref>

Some newer high end fax machines have built-in T.38 capabilities which are connected directly to a network switch or router. In T.38 each packet contains a portion of the data stream sent in the previous packet. Two successive packets have to be lost to actually lose data integrity.

==Power requirements==
Telephones for traditional residential analog service are usually connected directly to telephone company [[phone line]]s which provide direct current to power most basic analog handsets independently of locally available electrical power.

[[IP Phone]]s and VoIP telephone adapters connect to [[Network router|routers]] or [[cable modem]]s which typically depend on the availability of [[mains electricity]] or locally generated power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/Section.3083.html|title=ICT Regulation Tool Kit&nbsp;– 4.4 VOIP&nbsp;– Regulatory Issues&nbsp;– Universal Service|publisher=|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref> Some VoIP service providers use customer premises equipment (e.g., cablemodems) with battery-backed power supplies to assure uninterrupted service for up to several hours in case of local power failures. Such battery-backed devices typically are designed for use with analog handsets.

Some VoIP service providers implement services to route calls to other telephone services of the subscriber, such a cellular phone, in the event that the customer's network device is inaccessible to terminate the call.

The susceptibility of phone service to power failures is a common problem even with traditional analog service in areas where many customers purchase modern telephone units that operate with wireless handsets to a base station, or that have other modern phone features, such as built-in voicemail or phone book features.

==Security==
The security concerns of VoIP telephone systems are similar to those of other Internet-connected devices. This means that [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]] with knowledge of [[VoIP vulnerabilities]] can perform [[denial-of-service]] attacks, harvest customer data, record conversations, and compromise voicemail messages. Compromised VoIP user account or session credentials may enable an attacker to incur substantial charges from third-party services, such as long-distance or international calling.

The technical details of many VoIP protocols create challenges in routing VoIP traffic through [[firewall (networking)|firewalls]] and [[network address translator]]s, used to interconnect to transit networks or the Internet. Private [[session border controller]]s are often employed to enable VoIP calls to and from protected networks. Other methods to [[NAT traversal|traverse NAT]] devices involve assistive protocols such as [[STUN]] and [[Interactive Connectivity Establishment]] (ICE).

Though many consumer VoIP solutions do not support encryption of the signaling path or the media, securing a VoIP phone is conceptually easier to implement than on traditional telephone circuits. A result of the lack of encryption is that it is relatively easy to eavesdrop on VoIP calls when access to the data network is possible.<ref>{{cite web|website=CircleID|url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/examining_two_well_known_attacks_on_voip1/|title=Examining Two Well-Known Attacks on VoIP|accessdate=2006-04-05}}</ref> Free open-source solutions, such as [[Wireshark]], facilitate capturing VoIP conversations.

Standards for securing VoIP are available in the [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol]] (SRTP) and the [[ZRTP]] protocol for [[analog telephony adapter]]s, as well as for some [[softphone]]s. [[IPsec]] is available to secure [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] VoIP at the transport level by using [[opportunistic encryption]].

Government and military organizations use various security measures to protect VoIP traffic, such as voice over secure IP (VoSIP), secure voice over IP (SVoIP), and secure voice over secure IP (SVoSIP).<ref>[http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/stig/VoIP-STIG-V2R2.pdf Disa.mil], Internet Protocol Telephony & Voice over Internet Protocol Security Technical Implementation Guide</ref> The distinction lies in whether encryption is applied in the telephone endpoint or in the network.<ref>[http://www.gdc4s.com/Documents/Products/SecureVoiceData/GD-SVOIP_FAQ-w.pdf Secure Voice over IP (SVoIP) vs. Voice over Secure IP (VoSIP) Installations] General Dynamics C4 Systems</ref> Secure voice over secure IP may be implemented by encrypting the media with protocols such as [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol|SRTP]] and [[ZRTP]]. Secure voice over IP uses [[Type 1 encryption]] on a classified network, such as [[SIPRNet]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=Markus|last=Dunte|first2=Christoph|last2=Ruland|url=http://paper.ijcsns.org/07_book/200706/20070610.pdf|title=Secure Voice-over-IP|journal=International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security|date=June 2007|volume=7|issue=6|pages=63–68}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/voip/secure_voice_over_ip_322 Sans.org], SANS Institute InfoSec Reading Room</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=White|first=C.M.|author2=Teague, K.A.  |author3=Daniel, E.J. |title=Browse Conference Publications > Signals, Systems and Computer ...

==Caller ID==
Voice over IP protocols and equipment provide [[caller ID]] support that is compatible with the facility provided in the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN). Many VoIP service providers also allow callers to configure arbitrary caller ID information.<ref>[http://voipsa.org/blog/2006/09/29/hello-mom-im-a-fake/ VOIPSA.org], Blog: "Hello Mom, I'm a Fake!" (Telespoof and Fakecaller).</ref>

==Compatibility with traditional analog telephone sets==
Most analog telephone adapters do not decode dial pulses generated by rotary dial telephones, but rather support only [[touch-tone]] signaling, but pulse-to-tone converters are commercially available.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Support for other telephony devices==
Some special telephony services, such as those that operate in conjunction with digital video recorders, satellite television receivers, alarm systems, conventional modems over PSTN lines, may be impaired when operated over VoIP services, because of incompatibilities in design.

==Operational cost==
VoIP has drastically reduced the cost of communication by sharing network infrastructure between data and voice.<ref>[http://www.fcc.gov/voip/ FCC.gov], What are some advantages of VoIP?</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Voip Infrastructure|url=http://www.hp.com/rnd/pdfs/final_voip_techbrief.pdf}}</ref>
A single broad-band connection has the ability to transmit more than one telephone call. Secure calls using standardized protocols, such as [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol]], as most of the facilities of creating a [[secure telephone]] connection over traditional phone lines, such as digitizing and digital transmission, are already in place with VoIP. It is necessary only to [[encrypt]] and [[authenticate]] the existing data stream. Automated software, such as a [[Business telephone system#Current trends|virtual PBX]], may eliminate the need of personnel to greet and switch incoming calls.

==Regulatory and legal issues==
As the popularity of VoIP grows, governments are becoming more interested in regulating VoIP in a manner similar to PSTN services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipall.org/matrix/|title=Global VOIP Policy Status Matrix|accessdate=2006-11-23|publisher=Global IP Alliance}}</ref>

Throughout the developing world, particularly in countries where regulation is weak or captured by the dominant operator, restrictions on the use of VoIP are often imposed, including in [[Panama]] where VoIP is taxed, Guyana where VoIP is prohibited and India where its retail commercial sales is allowed but only for long distance service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-forall.org/pdf/Wireless&VOIP_10July2006.pdf|title=The Road to Broadband Development in Developing Countries is through Competition Driven by Wireless and VOIP|last=Proenza|first=Francisco J. |accessdate=2008-04-07|format=PDF}}</ref> In [[Ethiopia]], where the government is nationalising telecommunication service, it is a criminal offence to offer services using VoIP. The country has installed firewalls to prevent international calls being made using VoIP. These measures were taken after the popularity of VoIP reduced the income generated by the state owned telecommunication company.

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] regulates telephone service, including VoIP telephony service. VoIP services operating in Canada are required to provide [[9-1-1]] emergency service.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2005/dt2005-21.htm | title = Telecom Decision CRTC 2005-21 | date = 4 April 2005 | website = Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission | publisher = Government of Canada | access-date = 29 April 2017}}</ref>

===European Union===
{{update|section|2006|date=September 2013}}
In the [[European Union]], the treatment of VoIP service providers is a decision for each national telecommunications regulator, which must use competition law to define relevant national markets and then determine whether any service provider on those national markets has "significant market power" (and so should be subject to certain obligations). A general distinction is usually made between VoIP services that function over managed networks (via broadband connections) and VoIP services that function over unmanaged networks (essentially, the Internet).{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The relevant EU Directive is not clearly drafted concerning obligations which can exist independently of market power (e.g., the obligation to offer access to emergency calls), and it is impossible to say definitively whether VoIP service providers of either type are bound by them. A review of the EU Directive is under way and should be complete by 2007.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Arab states of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]]===

====Oman====
In [[Oman]], it is illegal to provide or use unauthorized VoIP services, to the extent that web sites of unlicensed VoIP providers have been blocked. Violations may be punished with fines of 50,000 Omani Rial (about 130,317 US dollars) or spend two years in jail or both. In 2009, police raided 121 Internet cafes throughout the country and arrested 212 people for using or providing VoIP services.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|title=Oman cuffs 212 for selling VoIP calls|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/20/oman_and_voip/|website=The Register|accessdate=20 September 2016}}</ref>

In the interest of the Access Service Providers and International Long Distance Operators the Internet telephony was permitted to the ISP with restrictions. Internet Telephony is considered to be different service in its scope, nature and kind from real time voice as offered by other Access Service Providers and Long Distance Carriers. Hence the following type of Internet Telephony are permitted in India:<ref>Harish Kumar Gangwar [https://www.scribd.com/doc/101919043/TECHNICAL-NOTE-ON-ILLEGAL-INTERNATIONAL-LONG-DISTANCE-TELEPHONE-EXCHANGE-IN-INDIA Technical Note on Illegal International Long Distance telephone Exchange in India]</ref>

Translation of E.164 number / private number to IP address allotted to any device and vice versa, by ISP to show compliance with IANA numbering scheme is not permitted.<br/> (f) The Internet Service Licensee is not permitted to have PSTN/PLMN connectivity. Voice communication to and from a telephone connected to PSTN/PLMN and following E.164 numbering is prohibited in India.

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], only providers registered with the government are authorized to offer VoIP services. Unlike many VoIP providers, most of whom offer flat rates, Korean VoIP services are generally metered and charged at rates similar to terrestrial calling. Foreign VoIP providers encounter high barriers to government registration. This issue came to a head in 2006 when [[Internet service providers]] providing personal Internet services by contract to [[United States Forces Korea]] members residing on USFK bases threatened to block off access to VoIP services used by USFK members as an economical way to keep in contact with their families in the United States, on the grounds that the service members' VoIP providers were not registered. A compromise was reached between USFK and Korean telecommunications officials in January 2007, wherein USFK service members arriving in Korea before June 1, 2007, and subscribing to the ISP services provided on base may continue to use their US-based VoIP subscription, but later arrivals must use a Korean-based VoIP provider, which by contract will offer pricing similar to the flat rates offered by US VoIP providers.<ref>[http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=41826&archive=true Stripes.com<!-- Bot generated title -->], Stars and Stripes: USFK deal keeps VoIP access for troops</ref>

===United States===
In the United States, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] requires all interconnected VoIP service providers to comply with requirements comparable to those for traditional telecommunications service providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cybertelecom.org/voip/fcc.htm|title=Cybertelecom :: VoIP :: FCC|first=Genny|last=Pershing|website=www.cybertelecom.org|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref> VoIP operators in the US are required to support [[local number portability]]; make service accessible to people with disabilities; pay regulatory fees, [[universal service]] contributions, and other mandated payments; and enable law enforcement authorities to conduct surveillance pursuant to the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA).

Operators of "Interconnected" VoIP (fully connected to the PSTN) are mandated to provide [[Enhanced 911]] service without special request, provide for customer location updates, clearly disclose any limitations on their E-911 functionality to their consumers, obtain affirmative acknowledgements of these disclosures from all consumers,<ref>[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/47cfr9_07.html GPO.gov], 47 C.F.R. pt. 9 (2007)</ref> and 'may not allow their customers to “opt-out” of 911 service.'<ref name=FCC-VoIP-911>{{cite web|title=VoIP and 911 Service|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/voip-and-911-service|publisher=FCC|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> VoIP operators also receive the benefit of certain US telecommunications regulations, including an entitlement to [[interconnection]] and exchange of traffic with [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]s via wholesale carriers. Providers of "nomadic" VoIP service—those who are unable to determine the location of their users—are exempt from state telecommunications regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/voip/|title=Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP)|date=November 18, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref>

Another legal issue that the US Congress is debating concerns changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The issue in question is calls between Americans and foreigners. The National Security Agency (NSA) is not authorized to tap Americans' conversations without a warrant—but the Internet, and specifically VoIP does not draw as clear a line to the location of a caller or a call's recipient as the traditional phone system does. As VoIP's low cost and flexibility convinces more and more organizations to adopt the technology, the surveillance for law enforcement agencies becomes more difficult. VoIP technology has also increased security concerns because VoIP and similar technologies have made it more difficult for the government to determine where a target is physically located when communications are being intercepted, and that creates a whole set of new legal challenges.<ref name="Greenberg">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/05/15/wiretapping-voip-lichtblau-tech-security08-cx_ag_0515wiretap.html/|title=The State Of Cybersecurity Wiretapping's Fuzzy Future|date=May 15, 2008|last=Greenberg|first=Andy |accessdate=2009-03-02|work=Forbes}}</ref>

==History==
The early developments of packet network designs by [[Paul Baran]] and other researchers were motivated by a desire for a higher degree of circuit redundancy and network availability in face of infrastructure failures than was possible in the circuit-switched networks in telecommunications in the mid-twentieth century.
In 1973, [[Danny Cohen (engineer)|Danny Cohen]] first demonstrated a form of [[packet telephony|packet voice]] as part of a flight simulator application, which operated across the early ARPANET.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/danny-cohen|title=Danny Cohen |publisher=INTERNET HALL of FAME|accessdate=2014-12-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yaUBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&ots=_Hz7Sw23PW&focus=viewport&dq=Network+Voice+Protocol+%28NVP%29+developed+by+Danny+Cohen|publisher=Willey|title=Advanced Content Delivery, Streaming, and Cloud Services (Pg 34)|accessdate=2014-12-06}}</ref> In the following time span of about two decades, various forms of packet telephony were developed and industry interest groups formed to support the new technologies. Following the termination of the ARPANET project, and expansion of the Internet for commercial traffic, IP telephony became an established area of interest in commercial labs of the major IT concerns, such [[Microsoft]] and [[Intel]], and open-source software, such as [[VocalTec]], became available by the mid-1990s. By the late 1990s, the first [[softswitch]]es became available, and new protocols, such as [[H.323]], the [[Media Gateway Control Protocol]] (MGCP) and the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) gained widespread attention. In the early 2000s, the proliferation of high-bandwidth always-on Internet connections to residential dwellings and businesses, spawned an industry of Internet telephony service providers (ITSPs). The development of open-source telephony software, such as [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk PBX]], fueled widespread interest and entrepreneurship in voice-over-IP services, applying new Internet technology paradigms, such as [[cloud service]]s to telephony.
