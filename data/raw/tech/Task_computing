'''Task computing''' is a computation meant to fill the gap between [[Task (computing)|tasks]] (what the user wants to be done) and [[Service (computing)|services]] (functionalities that are available to the user). Task computing seeks to redefine how users interact with and use computing environments. It is built on [[pervasive computing]].

== Task Computing Framework (TCF) and Task Computing Environment (TCE) ==
A Task Computing Framework (TCF) is a framework that supports task computing, by providing support for:
* The [[workflow]]s of task computing, i.e., at a minimum, discovery, followed by composition and [[Execution (computing)|execution]]
* [[Semantics|Semantic]] description of tasks and services
* Specification, execution, and re-usability of tasks by [[end user]]s
* Manipulation, including creation and disposal of services by end users

This definition of a task computing framework does not make reference to computational components. This is referred to as a Task Computing Environment (TCE). A TCE is a computational system that includes, at a minimum, the following components:
* One or more Task Computing Clients (TCCs),
* One or more [[Semantic service-oriented architecture|Semantically Described Services]] (SDSs),
* One or more Semantic Service Discovery Mechanisms (SSDMs), and
* Optionally, one or more Service Controls (SCs)

== Applications ==
Using Task Execution EditoR (STEER),<ref>[http://www.flacp.fujitsulabs.com/~rmasuoka/papers/Task-Computing-ISWC2003-202-color-final.pdf Microsoft Word - Task-Computing-ISCW2003-202-final.doc<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016164132/http://www.flacp.fujitsulabs.com/~rmasuoka/papers/Task-Computing-ISWC2003-202-color-final.pdf |date=2005-10-16 }}</ref> embodiments of multiple semantically described services and service controls, the following applications are possible:
* Exchanging [[Business Card]]s
* Showing and Sharing the Presentation
* Scheduling a Future Presentation
* Checking and Printing Directions to the Airport
