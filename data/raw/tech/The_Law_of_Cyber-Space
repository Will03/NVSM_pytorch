'''''The Law of Cyber-Space''''' is a book by [[Ahmad Kamal]], Senior Fellow at the [[United Nations Institute for Training and Research]] on the subject of [[Cyber law]].

As is explained in its Foreword, the book is a sequel to the earlier work on “Information Insecurity” published in 2002, in which it had been pointed out that the absence of globally harmonised legislation was turning cyber-space into an area of ever increasing dangers and worries.

The book lays down the possible parameters for a Law of Cyber-Space, and argues in favour of starting negotiations with the full participation of the three concerned stake-holders, namely governments, the private sector, and civil society.

Kamal believes that, in many ways, the current situation in cyber-space is similar to the problems once faced on the open ocean, where the absence of any jurisdiction or consensus legislation had also created a lawless situation. The international community finally woke up to the challenge, and started negotiations on the [[Law of the Sea]]. Those negotiations went on for almost a decade before they succeeded and Kamal writes that the world is much better off as a result. 

Kamal asserts that in the case of cyber-space the challenge appears to be far greater; 
:"The speed of change is phenomenal, new shoals and icebergs appear every day, the dangers affect all countries without exception, yet global responses are sporadic or non-existent.  That is why a globally negotiated and comprehensive Law of Cyber-Space is so essential."
