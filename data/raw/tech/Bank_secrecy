Swiss banking secrecy was first codified with the [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks|Banking Act of 1934]] which made it a crime to disclose client information to third parties without their consent. The law, coupled with a stable Swiss currency and international neutrality, prompted large capital flight to private Swiss accounts. During the 1940s, [[Numbered bank account|numbered bank accounts]] were introduced creating an enduring principle of bank secrecy that continues to be considered one of the main aspects of [[private banking]] globally. Advances in [[financial cryptography]] (via [[public-key cryptography]]) could make it possible to use anonymous electronic money and anonymous digital bearer certificates for financial privacy and anonymous Internet banking, given enabling institutions and secure computer systems.

[[Numbered bank account|Numbered bank accounts]], used by Swiss banks and other offshore banks located in tax havens, have been accused by the international community of being a major instrument of the underground economy, facilitating tax evasion and money laundering.<ref name=":0" /> After [[Al Capone]]'s 1931 condemnation for tax evasion, according to journalist [[Lucy Komisar]]:

<blockquote>mobster [[Meyer Lansky]] took money from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] slot machines and shifted it to accounts overseas. The Swiss secrecy law two years later assured him of [[G-Man (slang)|G-man]]-proof-banking. Later, he bought a Swiss bank and for years deposited his Havana casino take in Miami accounts, then wired the funds to Switzerland via a network of shell and [[holding company|holding]] companies and offshore accounts.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2003/04/offshore-banking-the-secret-threat-to-america/|title=Offshore Banking: The Secret Threat to America|last=Komisar|first=Lucy|date=April 4, 2003|website=www.thekomisarscoop.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 18, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

Economist and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]], told Komisar:

<blockquote>You ask why, if there's an important role for a regulated banking system, do you allow a non-regulated banking system to continue? It's in the interest of some of the moneyed interests to allow this to occur. It's not an accident; it could have been shut down at any time. If you said the US, the UK, the major [[G7]] banks will not deal with offshore bank centers that don't comply with G7 banks regulations, these banks could not exist. They only exist because they engage in transactions with standard banks.<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>
