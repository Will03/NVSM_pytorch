'''Science outreach''', also called '''Education and Public Outreach''' ('''EPO''' or '''E/PO''') or simply '''public outreach''',{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} is an [[umbrella term]] for a variety of activities by [[research institute]]s, [[University|universities]], and institutions such as [[science museum]]s, aimed at promoting [[Public awareness of science|public awareness (and understanding) of science]] and making informal contributions to [[science education]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Varner, Johanna|title=Scientific outreach: toward effective public engagement with biological science|journal=BioScience|volume=64|issue=4|year=2014|pages=333–340|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu021}}</ref>

==Scope and history==

While there have always been individual scientists interested in educating the public, science outreach has recently become more organized. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]) now requires all of its projects to organize suitable outreach activities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Also working to inform the public are organizations such as Communicating Astronomy to the Public<ref>[http://www.communicatingastronomy.org/meetings/ Communicating Astronomy to the Public]</ref> and the Washington Declaration on Communicating Astronomy to the Public<ref>[http://www.nrao.edu/ccap/conf_wash.shtml Washington Declaration on Communicating Astronomy to the Public]</ref> that organize conferences for the public on science issues and make efforts to put outreach on a more general institutional footing.

Recently, an increasing number of projects have hired designated outreach scientists (part-time or full-time) that handle public relations for their project. There are also specialized outreach providers such as the Education branch of the [[Space Science Institute]]<ref>[http://www.spacescience.org/education/index.html Education branch of the Space Science Institute]</ref> in Boulder, Colorado and the [[NASA Education and Public Outreach Group at Sonoma State University|Education and Public Outreach Group]] at [[Sonoma State University]] which offer to organize a project's outreach activities on a contractual basis.

In addition to outreach by research institutions, an important part of informal science education are outreach programs such as [[science museum]]s and [[science festival]]s.

==Examples of science outreach activities==

Science outreach can take on a variety of forms.

===Public talks/lectures/discussions===
[[File:Universum für Alle - New book showcases ESO images.jpg|thumb|Universum für Alle: 70 short popular lectures at [[Heidelberg University]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New Book Showcases ESO Images|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann12091/|accessdate=3 December 2012|newspaper=ESO Announcements}}</ref> ]]

Lectures are probably the oldest form of science outreach, dating back to the 1820s when [[Michael Faraday]] organized the first of the [[Royal Institution|Royal Institution's]] [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas Lectures]].<ref>{{cite web | title=The RI Christmas Lectures (Royal Institution Website)| url=http://www.rigb.org/rimain/events/christmaslectures.jsp}}</ref>

Public talks can be part of a lecture series, given at a [[science festival]] or in cooperation with a special interest group such as a local [[astronomy club]]. Public presentations can have a variety of formats, including straightforward lecture formats with or without [[Scientific demonstration|experimental demonstrations]], guided live interviews, and discussions with several participants and a moderator. There are also less formal initiatives such as [[Café Scientifique]], in which a café or bar is the venue for regular meetings involving guest scientists that come to talk about their work or take part in discussions with members of the public.

===Visiting primary and secondary schools===

School students and teachers are an important target group for science outreach. Outreach activities can include scientists visiting schools, giving talks at assemblies, discussions with students, or participation in events such as [[career fair]]s and science and technology camps.  One organization that focuses on this kind of science outreach is [[Robogals]]. Many universities also have science outreach programs that are dedicated to building relationships between high school students, university scientists, and K-12 teachers. A few of the most prominent university science outreach programs include Carolina Science Outreach,<ref>{{cite web | title=Carolina Science Outreach | url=http://www.csousc.org}}</ref> the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science,<ref>{{cite web | title=Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science | url=http://studentorgs.vanderbilt.edu/vsvs/}}</ref> the Rockefeller University Science Outreach Program,<ref>{{cite web | title=Rockefeller University Science Outreach Program | url=http://www.rockefeller.edu/outreach/}}</ref> the Present Your Ph.D. Thesis to a 12-Year Old Outreach Project at University of Texas in Austin,<ref>{{cite web | title=Science Educational Outreach Programs That Benefit Students and Scientists | url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002368}}</ref> and the Stanford University Office of Science Outreach.<ref>{{cite web | title=Stanford University Office of Science Outreach| url=http://oso.stanford.edu/}}</ref> Using Canada as an example, it has been estimated that with sufficient organization, every classroom from kindergarten through graduation could in practice receive a visit from one or more scientists annually with participation from only 10-15% of the scientific enterprise.<ref>Bechara J. Saab, [http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/?p=902 "Engaging the Clutch of the Science Communication Continuum – Shifting Science Outreach into High Gear"], ''Hypothesis'' Volume 8 Issue 1 (September 2010).</ref> Some examples of science outreach programs in Canada include: [[Let's Talk Science]], [[Actua (Canadian charity)|Actua]], [[Chemical Institute of Canada|The Chemical Institute of Canada]], and [[Science Rendezvous]]. 

===Workshops/schools for teachers and/or students===
[[File:Cover of the ALMA radioastronomy manual.jpg|thumb|Cover of the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] [[radioastronomy]] manual.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALMA Material for Teachers|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15052/|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>]]
Inviting groups of school students to a research institution for a workshop is another popular form of outreach.  Formats range from a one-day visit to more involved week-long events such as [[Perimeter Institute]]'s International Summer School for Young Physicists, a two-week-long programs for a total of a hundred Canadian and international students from grade 11.<ref>[http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/Outreach/Education/ISSYP_Overview International Summer School for Young Physicists]</ref>

Another method of science outreach invites school teachers to participate in workshops where they are able to learn effective strategies to engage students in science. This approach was especially embraced by the [[Canadian Space Agency]] which held an annual "Space Educators" conference up until 2012 to provides teachers with access to resources to educate their students in space-related science.<ref>{{cite web | title=Canadian Space Agency Educators Resources | url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/educators/default.asp}}</ref>

===Supporting science fairs and similar events===
[[File:Cloud chamber as science for general public.jpg|thumb|One of the major goals of [[science festival]]s is to make [[science]] more accessible to [[general public]]. [[Cloud chamber]]s are popular at [[science fair]]s for their capacity to visualize the otherwise [[invisible]] [[radiation]] which surrounds us.]]
Besides organizing independent events, many outreach organizations sponsor existing events that promote sciences awareness. A notable examples are [[science fair]]s, [[public science]] events in which working scientists can participate both as judges and as sponsors of student projects.

=== Online aggregation of science activities, resources, and programs ===
The internet is a rich source of science activities, resources, and programs. For example, research laboratories often maintain educational outreach projects aimed at translating their science into something meaningful for the general public, often [[K–12|K-12]] students, as an effort to increase research broader impacts required by funding agencies such as the NSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/special/broaderimpacts/|title=Broader Impacts - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2016-07-11}}</ref> These may include activities using fast-growing plants that exhibit distinctive mutants with unique [[phenotype]]s useful to teach K-12 students about both Mendelian and molecular genetics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fpsc.wisc.edu/program/index.shtm|title=FPsc: genetics, evolution, modern genetic sciences|website=fpsc.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}</ref> Some institutions and organizations maintain large<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/|title=Home {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}</ref> or small<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanfordlab.org/education/updates|title=Education and Outreach {{!}} Sanford Underground Research Facility|website=www.sanfordlab.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}</ref> aggregations of their activity resources,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanfordlab.org/education/curriculum-modules|title=Curriculum Modules {{!}} Sanford Underground Research Facility|website=www.sanfordlab.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}</ref> outreach programs,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/outreachprograms.htm|title=Outreach Programs {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}</ref> upcoming events calendars,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://today.wisc.edu/events/feed/2/|title=Science / UW-Madison Events Calendar|website=today.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}</ref> and partnering programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/sciencealliance.htm|title=Science Alliance {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}</ref>
