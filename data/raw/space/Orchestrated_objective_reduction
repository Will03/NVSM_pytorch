'''Orchestrated objective reduction''' ('''Orch OR''') is a biological [[theory of mind]] that postulates that [[consciousness]] originates at the [[Quantum mind|quantum level]] inside [[neurons]], rather than the conventional view that it is a product of connections between neurons. The mechanism is held to be a [[quantum physics|quantum]] process called [[objective reduction]] that is orchestrated by cellular structures called [[microtubule]]s.

===Background===
{{further|Penrose–Lucas argument}}
In 1931, mathematician and logician [[Kurt Gödel]] [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|proved]] that any [[effective procedure|effectively generated]] theory capable of proving basic arithmetic cannot be both [[consistency|consistent]] and [[completeness (logic)|complete]]. In other words, a mathematically sound theory lacks the means to prove itself. An analogous statement has been used to show that humans are subject to the same limits as machines.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=476–477}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=950}}, {{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "The Argument from Mathematics" where he writes "although it is established that there are limitations to the powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect."</ref> However, in his first book on consciousness, ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'' (1989), [[Roger Penrose]] argued that Gödel-unprovable results are provable by human mathematicians.<ref name=Penrose1989/> He takes this disparity to mean that human mathematicians are not describable as formal proof systems, and are therefore running a [[computable function|non-computable algorithm]].

If correct, the [[Penrose–Lucas argument]] leaves the question of the physical basis of non-computable behaviour open. Most physical laws are computable, and thus algorithmic. However, Penrose determined that [[wave function collapse]] was a prime candidate for a non-computable process. In [[quantum mechanics]], particles are treated differently from the objects of [[classical mechanics]]. Particles are described by [[wave function]]s that evolve according to the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Non-stationary wave functions are [[linear combination]]s of the [[eigenstate]]s of the system, a phenomenon described by the [[superposition principle]]. When a quantum system interacts with a classical system—i.e. when an [[observable]] is measured—the system appears to [[wave function collapse|collapse]] to a random eigenstate of that observable from a classical vantage point.

If collapse is truly random, then no process or algorithm can deterministically predict its outcome. This provided Penrose with a candidate for the physical basis of the non-computable process that he hypothesized to exist in the brain. However, he disliked the random nature of environmentally induced collapse, as randomness was not a promising basis for mathematical understanding. Penrose proposed that isolated systems may still undergo a new form of wave function collapse, which he called objective reduction (OR).<ref name="Penrose-Hameroff2014"/>

Penrose sought to reconcile [[general relativity]] and quantum theory using his own ideas about the possible structure of [[spacetime]].<ref name=Penrose1989>{{Cite book |last=Penrose |first= Roger |authorlink=Roger Penrose |title=The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds and The Laws of Physics |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |page=480|isbn=978-0-19-851973-7|title-link= The Emperor's New Mind }}</ref><ref name= Penrose1994>{{Cite book |last=Penrose |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Penrose |title=Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989 |page= 457 |isbn=978-0-19-853978-0}}</ref> He suggested that at the [[Planck scale]] curved spacetime is not continuous, but discrete. He further postulated that each separated [[quantum superposition]] has its own piece of [[spacetime curvature]], a blister in spacetime. Penrose suggests that gravity exerts a force on these spacetime blisters, which become unstable above the Planck scale of <math>10^{-35} \text{m}</math> and collapse to just one of the possible states. The rough threshold for OR is given by Penrose's indeterminacy principle:
::<math>\tau \approx \hbar/E_G</math>
:where:
::* <math>\tau</math> is the time until OR occurs, 
::* <math>E_G</math> is the gravitational self-energy or the degree of spacetime separation given by the superpositioned mass, and
::* <math>\hbar</math> is the [[reduced Planck constant]]. 
Thus, the greater the mass-energy of the object, the faster it will undergo OR and vice versa. Atomic-level superpositions would require 10 million years to reach OR threshold, while an isolated 1 [[kilogram]] object would reach OR threshold in 10<sup>−37</sup>s. Objects somewhere between these two scales could collapse on a timescale relevant to neural processing.<ref name="Penrose-Hameroff2014"/>{{additional citation needed|date=May 2013 |reason=Search for supporting evidence besides the papers from the main authors of the theory.}}

An essential feature of Penrose's theory is that the choice of states when objective reduction occurs is selected neither randomly (as are choices following wave function collapse) nor algorithmically. Rather, states are selected by a "non-computable" influence embedded in the [[Planck]] scale of spacetime geometry. Penrose claimed that such information is [[Platonism|Platonic]], representing pure mathematical truth, aesthetic and ethical values at the Planck scale. This relates to Penrose's ideas concerning the three worlds: the physical, the mental, and  the Platonic mathematical world.<ref name="Penrose-Hameroff2014"/>{{additional citation needed|date=May 2013 |reason=Search for supporting evidence besides the papers from the main authors of the theory.}}

===Orch OR===
Penrose outlined a predecessor to Orch OR in ''The Emperor's New Mind'', coming to the problem from a mathematical viewpoint and in particular Gödel's theorem, but lacked a detailed proposal for how quantum processes could be implemented in the brain. [[Stuart Hameroff]] separately worked in cancer research and [[anesthesia]], which gave him an interest in brain processes. Hameroff read Penrose's book and suggested to him that [[microtubule]]s within neurons were suitable candidate sites for quantum processing, and ultimately for consciousness.<ref name="Hameroff1982">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(82)90137-0 |author1=Hameroff, S.R. |author2=Watt, R.C.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Information processing in microtubules |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=549–561 |year=1982 |url= http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/documents/informationprocessing_hameroff_000.pdf |pmid=6185798}}</ref><ref name="Hameroff1987">{{cite book |author=Hameroff, S.R. |title=Ultimate Computing |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=1987 |url=http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/ultimatecomputing.html |isbn=978-0-444-70283-8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406000209/http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/ultimatecomputing.html |archivedate=2005-04-06 |df= }}</ref> Throughout the 1990s, the two collaborated on the Orch-OR theory, which Penrose published in ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]'' (1994).<ref name=Penrose1994/>

Hameroff's contribution to the theory derived from his study of the neural [[cytoskeleton]], and particularly on microtubules.<ref name=Hameroff1987/> As neuroscience has progressed, the role of the cytoskeleton and microtubules has assumed greater importance. In addition to providing structural support, microtubule functions include [[axoplasmic transport]] and control of the cell's movement, growth and shape.<ref name=Hameroff1987/>

Orch OR combines the Penrose–Lucas argument with Hameroff's hypothesis on quantum processing in microtubules. It proposes that when condensates in the brain undergo an objective wave function reduction, their collapse connects noncomputational decision-making to experiences embedded in spacetime's fundamental geometry. The theory further proposes that the microtubules both influence and are influenced by the conventional activity at the synapses between neurons.

====Microtubule computation====

Hameroff proposed that microtubules were suitable candidates for quantum processing.<ref name=Hameroff1987/> Microtubules are made up of [[tubulin]] [[protein]] subunits. The tubulin protein [[Dimer (biochemistry)|dimers]] of the microtubules have [[hydrophobic]] pockets that may contain delocalized [[π electron]]s. Tubulin has other, smaller non-polar regions, for example 8 [[tryptophan]]s per tubulin, which contain π electron-rich [[indole]] rings distributed throughout tubulin with separations of roughly 2&nbsp;nm. Hameroff claims that this is close enough for the tubulin π electrons to become [[quantum entanglement|quantum entangled]].<ref name=Hameroff_2007>{{cite book |last=Hameroff |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Hameroff |chapter=That's life!

Hameroff originally suggested in the fringe ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]'' that the tubulin-subunit electrons would form a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].<ref name="Penrose-Hameroff2011">{{cite journal

However, this too was rejected by Reimers' group.<ref name="Reimers2009">{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0806273106 |pmid=19251667 |pmc=2657444 |title=Weak, strong, and coherent regimes of Frohlich condensation and their applications to terahertz medicine and quantum consciousness |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=11 |pages=4219–4224 |year=2009 |last1=Reimers |first1=J.

"Reimers et al have most definitely NOT shown that strong or coherent Frohlich condensation in microtubules is unfeasible. The model microtubule on which they base their Hamiltonian is not a microtubule structure, but a simple linear chain of oscillators." Hameroff reasoned that such condensate behavior would magnify nanoscopic quantum effects to have large scale influences in the brain.

Hameroff proposed that condensates in microtubules in one [[neuron]] can link with microtubule condensates in other neurons and [[glial cell]]s via the [[gap junctions]] of [[electrical synapse]]s.<ref name="Hameroff2006a">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000542-200608000-00024 |author=Hameroff, S.R. |title=The entwined mysteries of anesthesia and consciousness |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=400–412 |year=2006 |pmid=16871075}}</ref><ref name="Hameroff2009">{{cite journal |author= Hameroff, S. |title=The "conscious pilot"—dendritic synchrony moves through the brain to mediate consciousness |journal=Journal of Biological Physics |volume= 36 |pages= 71–93 |year=2009 |doi=10.1007/s10867-009-9148-x |pmid= 19669425 |issue= 1 |pmc= 2791805}}</ref> Hameroff proposed that the gap between the cells is sufficiently small that quantum objects can [[quantum tunneling|tunnel]] across it, allowing them to extend across a large area of the brain.

===Decoherence in living organisms===
In 2000 [[Max Tegmark|Tegmark]] claimed that any quantum coherent system in the brain would undergo effective [[wave function collapse]] due to environmental interaction long before it could influence neural processes (the ''"warm, wet and noisy"'' argument, as it was later came to be known).<ref name=Tegmark2000/> He determined the decoherence timescale of microtubule entanglement at brain temperatures to be on the order of [[femtosecond]]s, far too brief for neural processing. [[Christof Koch]] and [[Klaus Hepp]] also agreed that [[Coherence (physics)#Quantum coherence|quantum coherence]] does not play, or does not need to play any major role in [[neurophysiology]].<ref name=Koch2006/><ref name=Hepp2012/> Koch and Hepp concluded that ''``The empirical demonstration of slowly decoherent and controllable quantum bits in neurons connected by electrical or chemical synapses, or the discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for computations performed by the brain, would do much to bring these speculations from the ‘far-out’ to the mere ‘very unlikely’.''''<ref name=Koch2006/>

In response to Tegmark's claims, Hagan, Tuszynski and Hameroff<ref name="Hagan2002">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.65.061901 |pmid=12188753 |title=Quantum computation in brain microtubules: Decoherence and biological feasibility |journal=Physical Review E |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=061901 |year=2002 |last1=Hagan |first1=S. |last2=Hameroff |first2=S.

This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24&nbsp;nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, although still far below 25&nbsp;ms. Hameroff's group also suggested that the [[Debye force|Debye]] layer of [[counterion]]s could screen thermal fluctuations, and that the surrounding actin [[gel]] might enhance the ordering of water, further screening noise. They also suggested that incoherent metabolic energy could further order water, and finally that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for [[quantum error correction]], a means of resisting quantum decoherence.

Since the 1990s numerous counter-observations to the "warm, wet and noisy" argument existed at ambient temperatures, ''in vitro''<ref name=elsevier2014 /><ref name="Bandyopadhyay2013A" /> and ''in vivo'' (i.e. [[photosynthesis]], [[bird navigation]]).

In 2009, Reimers ''et al.'' and McKemmish ''et al.,'' published critical assessments.<ref name=" McKemmish2009"/><ref name="Reimers2009"/><ref name="Reimers2013">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2013.11.003 |pmid=24268490 |title=The revised Penrose–Hameroff orchestrated objective-reduction proposal for human consciousness is not scientifically justified |journal=Physics of Life Reviews |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=101–103 |year=2014 |last1=Reimers |first1=Jeffrey R. |last2=McKemmish |first2=Laura K. |last3=McKenzie |first3=Ross H. |last4=Mark |first4=Alan E. |last5=Hush |first5=Noel S. |bibcode=2014PhLRv..11..101R }}</ref> Earlier versions of the theory had required tubulin-electrons to form either [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein]]s or [[Herbert Fröhlich|Frohlich]] condensates, and the Reimers group claimed that these were experimentally unfounded. Additionally they claimed that microtubules could only support 'weak' 8&nbsp;MHz coherence. The first argument was voided by revisions of the theory that described dipole oscillations due to [[London forces]] and possibly due to magnetic and/or nuclear spin cloud formations.<ref name="HameroffVs7Others2014" /> On the second issue the theory was retrofitted so that 8&nbsp;MHz coherence is sufficient to support the whole Orch-OR hypothesis.

McKemmish ''et al.'' made two claims: that aromatic molecules cannot switch states because they are delocalised; and that changes in tubulin protein-conformation driven by [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] conversion would result in a prohibitive energy requirement. Hameroff and Penrose responded to the first claim by stating that they were referring to the behaviour of two or more electron clouds, inherently non-localised. For the second claim they stated that no GTP conversion is needed since (in that version of the theory) the conformation-switching is not necessary, replaced by oscillation due to the [[London force]]s produced by the electron cloud dipole states.
