The '''United States Astronaut Hall of Fame''', located inside the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] Heroes & Legends building, honors American [[astronauts]] and features the world's largest collection of their personal memorabilia, focusing on those astronauts who have been inducted into the Hall; as well as ''[[Mercury-Atlas 8|Sigma 7]]'', the fifth manned [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] [[spacecraft]]. 

==History==
[[Image:Project Mercury-Mercury Seven-Astronauts.jpg|left|thumb|The Mercury astronauts in 1962, inducted 1990]]
In the 1980s, the six then-surviving [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts conceived of establishing a place where US space travelers could be remembered and honored, along the lines of [[Hall of fame|halls of fame]] for other fields.<ref>[http://www.astronautscholarship.org/ahof.html U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519102131/http://astronautscholarship.org/ahof.html |date=2009-05-19 }}, retrieved 2007-08-23</ref> The Mercury Seven Foundation and Astronaut Scholarship Foundation were formed and have a role in the current operations of the Hall of Fame. The foundation's first executive director was former [[Associated Press]] space reporter Howard Benedict. <!-- not [[Howard Benedict]] -->

The Astronaut Hall of Fame was opened on October 29, 1990, by the U.S. Space Camp Foundation, which was the first owner of the facility. It was located next to the Florida branch of [[United States Space Camp|Space Camp]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=1101377&date=19901030&query=Astronaut+hall+of+fame | title=Mercury Museum -- Hall Of Fame Honors 7 Who Blazed A Trail In Space | author=Jay Clarke | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=1990-10-30 | accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref>

The Hall of Fame closed for several months in 2002 when U.S. Space Camp Foundation's creditors foreclosed on the property due to low attendance and mounting debt.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.space.com/news/fl_spacecamp_020806.html | title=Space Camp Florida Faces Foreclosure, Low Attendance Partly to Blame | publisher=Florida Today | author=Corey Schubert | date=2002-08-07 | accessdate=2007-05-27 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618174410/http://www.space.com/news/fl_spacecamp_020806.html | archive-date=2008-06-18 | dead-url=yes | df= }}</ref> That September, an auction was held and the property was purchased by [[Delaware North Companies|Delaware North Park Services]] on behalf of [[NASA]] and the property was added to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.

The original Hall of Fame which was located just west of the NASA Causeway closed to the public on November 2, 2015, in preparation for its relocation and re-launch at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex 6 miles (9.7 km) to the east on Merritt Island. Outside of the building was a full-scale replica of Space Shuttle Inspiration where visitors can enter the inside and view.

That building was purchased at auction by visitor complex operator [[Delaware North]] and renamed the ATX Center and houses educational programs including Camp Kennedy Space Center and the Astronaut Training Experience.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2015/10/26/us-astronaut-hall-fame-closing-soon-relocation/74337790/|title=U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame closing soon for relocation|work=Florida Today|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}</ref>

==Inductees==
{{See also|Category:United States Astronaut Hall of Fame inductees}}

Inductees into the Hall of Fame are selected by a blue ribbon committee of former NASA officials and flight controllers,  historians, journalists, and other space authorities based on their accomplishments in space or their contributions to the advancement of space exploration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/ids/news/2004/q2/nr_040504m.html |title=Boeing Executive Inducted Into Astronaut Hall of Fame |publisher=The Boeing Company |date=2004-05-04 |accessdate=2007-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613180721/http://www.boeing.com/ids/news/2004/q2/nr_040504m.html |archivedate=June 13, 2008 }}</ref> Except for 2002, inductions have been held every year since 2001.[[File:Neil Armstrong pose.jpg|left|100 px|thumb|Neil Armstrong, inducted 1993]] [[File:EdwardWhite.jpeg|right|100 px|thumb|Ed White, inducted 1993]]

As its inaugural class in 1990, the Hall of Fame inducted the United States' original group of astronauts: the Mercury Seven.  In addition to being the first American astronauts, they set several firsts in American spaceflight, both auspicious and tragic.  [[Alan Shepard]] was the first American in space and later became one of the twelve people to walk on the Moon. [[John Glenn]] was the first American to orbit the [[Earth]] and after his induction went on, in 1998, to become the oldest man to fly in space, aged 77.  [[Gus Grissom]] was the first American to fly in space twice and was the commander of the ill-fated [[Apollo 1]], which resulted in the first astronaut deaths directly related to preparation for spaceflight. [[File:Sally Ride in 1964.jpg|left|100 px|thumb|[[Sally Ride]], inducted 2003]][[File:Guion Bluford.jpg|right|100 px|thumb|Guy Bluford, inducted 2010]]

Thirteen astronauts from the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] programs were inducted in 1993. This class included the first and last humans to walk on the Moon, [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Eugene Cernan]];  [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], the first American to [[Extra-vehicular activity|walk in space]] (also killed in the Apollo 1 accident); [[Jim Lovell]], commander of the famously near-tragic [[Apollo 13]];  and [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]], whose six flights included a moonwalk and command of the first [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] mission.

The third class was inducted in 1997 and consisted of the 24 additional Gemini, Apollo, and [[Skylab]] astronauts. Notable members of the class were [[Roger Chaffee]], the third astronaut killed in the Apollo 1 fire and the only unflown astronaut in the Hall; [[Harrison Schmitt]], the first scientist and next-to-last person to walk on the [[Moon]]; and [[Jack Swigert]] and [[Fred Haise]], the Apollo 13 crewmembers not previously inducted.

Over two dozen astronauts from the Space Shuttle program have been inducted since 2001.  Among these are [[Sally Ride]], the first American woman in space;  [[Story Musgrave]], who flew six missions in the 1980s and 90s; and [[Francis Scobee]], commander of the ill-fated final [[STS-51L|''Challenger'']] mission.<ref name="list">[http://www.astronautscholarship.org/ahof.html U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame at KSC Visitor Complex - Astronaut Scholarship Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519102131/http://astronautscholarship.org/ahof.html |date=2009-05-19 }}, United States Astronaut Hall of Fame, retrieved 2009-05-04</ref>

[[Image:Sigma7-2.jpg|thumb|right|180px| [[Mercury-Atlas 8|''Sigma 7'']] Mercury spacecraft]]
The Hall of Heroes is composed of tributes to the inductees. Among the Hall of Fame's displays is ''Sigma 7'', the Mercury spacecraft piloted by Wally Schirra which orbited the Earth six times in 1962. An Astronaut Adventure room includes simulators for use by children.

The [[spacesuit]] worn by Gus Grissom during his [[Mercury-Redstone 4|Mercury flight]] is on display and has been the subject of a dispute between NASA and Grissom's heirs and supporters since 2002. The spacesuit, along with other Grissom artifacts, were loaned to the original owners of the Hall of Fame by the Grissom family when it opened. After the Hall of Fame went into bankruptcy and was taken over by a NASA contractor in 2002, the family requested that all their items be returned.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.space.com/news/grissom_spacesuit_021120.html | title=Gus Grissom's Family, NASA Fight Over Spacesuit | publisher=Florida Today | author=John Kelly | date=2002-11-20 | accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref>  All of the items were returned to Grissom's family except the spacesuit, because both NASA and the Grissoms claim ownership of it.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/11/30/nasa-astronauts-family-fight-over-a-spacesuit/5f0fde2b-3514-4399-8d2a-a7275ddc35ac/|title = NASA, Astronaut's Family Fight Over a Spacesuit|date = 2002-11-30|publisher = Washington Post|accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>  NASA claims Grissom checked out the spacesuit for a [[show and tell (education)|show and tell]] at his son's school, and then never returned it, while the Grissoms claim Gus rescued the spacesuit from a scrap heap.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/23/AR2005082301204_pf.html | title=Grissom Spacesuit in Tug of War | publisher=Washington Post | author=Christopher Lee | date=2005-08-24 | accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref>
