A '''star party''' is a gathering of amateur [[astronomer]]s for the purpose of observing [[astronomical object|objects]] and [[celestial event|events]] in the [[sky]]. Local star parties may be one-night affairs, but larger events can last up to a week or longer and attract hundreds or even thousands of participants. Many clubs have monthly star parties during the warmer months. Large regional star parties are held annually and are an important part of the [[hobby]] of [[amateur astronomy]].  A naturally dark site away from [[light pollution]] is typical. 

Participants bring [[telescope]]s and [[binoculars]] of all [[List of telescope types|types]] and sizes and spend the nights observing [[astronomical object]]s such as [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[star]]s, and [[deep-sky object]]s together. [[Astrophotography]] and [[CCD imaging]] are also very popular. At larger star parties, lectures, swap meets, exhibitions of [[amateur telescope making|home-built telescopes]], contests, tours, raffles, and other similar activities are common. Commercial vendors selling a variety of astronomical equipment may also be present. As with other hobbyist gatherings, much camaraderie and discussion of various aspects of the hobby occurs at any star party.

==History==
The idea of a star party is not new and allegedly goes back at least as far as [[George III of the United Kingdom]], who was passionately interested in [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]].<ref>[http://www.sloughmuseum.co.uk/the_kings_astronomer.htm The King's Astronomer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116065146/http://www.sloughmuseum.co.uk/the_kings_astronomer.htm |date=2007-11-16 }} Retrieved 2007-12-12</ref><ref>[http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/george3.html George III biography page] Retrieved 2007-12-12</ref> On nights when poor weather blocked the view of the real stars and planets, attendants are said to have hung paper lanterns marked with drawings in the trees around the royal palace to provide something else for the King and his guests to spot through their telescopes.

==Public star parties==
Star parties whose focus is on bringing the stars to the people are often staged in urban areas where people congregate in large numbers. This is in contrast to star parties typically held in remote dark-sky areas more conducive to stargazing.

In the US, notable star parties include the annual [[Winter Star Party]], held in the Florida Keys; the [[Mid Atlantic Star Party]], held on the east coast of the United States; the [[Oregon Star Party]]; the [[Stellafane|Stellafane Convention]], held in Vermont; the [[Texas Star Party]], held in west Texas; and the Okie-Tex Star Party, held near Kenton, Oklahoma. In the United Kingdom, notable annual star parties include the Spring[http://www.starparty.org/] and Autumn[http://starparty.las-astro.org.uk/index.php] Equinox star parties held at Kelling Heath Holiday Park[http://www.kellingheath.co.uk/] and Kielder[http://kielderforeststarcamp.org/] in Northumbria. In Australia, the [[Astronomical Society of New South Wales#South Pacific Star Party|South Pacific Star Party]] is held each year.
