'''Pluto''' ([[minor planet designation]]: '''134340 Pluto''') is a [[dwarf planet]] in the [[Kuiper belt]], a ring of [[trans-Neptunian object|bodies beyond Neptune]]. It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered and is the largest known [[plutoid]] (or ''ice dwarf'').

Pluto was discovered by [[Clyde Tombaugh]] in 1930 and was originally considered to be the [[Planets beyond Neptune|ninth planet]] from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a [[planet]] was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt. In 2005, [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a dwarf planet in the [[scattered disc]] which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered. This led the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) to [[IAU definition of planet|define the term "planet"]] formally in 2006, during their 26th General Assembly. That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet.

Pluto is the largest and second-most-massive (after [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]) known dwarf planet in the [[Solar System]], and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the [[Sun]]. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small—about one-sixth the mass of the [[Moon]] and one-third its volume. It has a moderately [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s or AU (4.4–7.4 billion&nbsp;km) from the Sun. This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than [[Neptune]], but a stable [[orbital resonance]] with Neptune prevents them from colliding.  Light from the Sun takes about 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5&nbsp;AU).

Pluto has [[moons of Pluto|five known moons]]: [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] (the largest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), [[Styx (moon)|Styx]], [[Nix (moon)|Nix]], [[Kerberos (moon)|Kerberos]], and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]]. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a [[binary system]] because the [[barycenter]] of their orbits does not lie within either body.

On July 14, 2015, the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft became the first spacecraft to [[planetary flyby|fly by]] Pluto. During its brief flyby, ''New Horizons'' made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons. In September 2016, astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of [[tholin]]s, [[organic compound|organic]] [[macromolecule]]s that may be ingredients for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]], and produced from [[methane]], [[nitrogen]] and other gases released from the [[atmosphere of Pluto]] and transferred about {{convert|19,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the orbiting moon.

[[File:Pluto discovery plates.png|left|thumb|alt=The same area of night sky with stars, shown twice, side by side. One of the bright points, located with an arrow, changes position between the two images.|Discovery photographs of Pluto]]
[[File:Clyde W. Tombaugh.jpeg|left|thumb|upright|Clyde Tombaugh, in Kansas]]
In the 1840s, [[Urbain Le Verrier]] used [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]] to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet [[Neptune]] after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of [[Uranus]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems |first=Ken |last=Croswell |location=New York |publisher=The Free Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-684-83252-4 |page=43 |ref=harv}}</ref> Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune.

In 1906, [[Percival Lowell]]—a wealthy Bostonian who had founded [[Lowell Observatory]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], in 1894—started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet, which he termed "[[Planet X]]".<ref name="Tombaugh1946" /> By 1909, Lowell and [[William Henry Pickering|William H. Pickering]] had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet.<ref name="Hoyt" /> Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were.<ref name="Hoyt" /><ref name="Littman1990" /> There are fourteen other known [[precovery]] observations, with the earliest made by the [[Yerkes Observatory]] on August 20, 1909.<ref name="BuchwaldDimarioWild2000" />

Percival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=50}} [[Vesto Melvin Slipher]], the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old [[Clyde Tombaugh]], who had just arrived at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=50}}

Tombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a [[blink comparator]], he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=52}} After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the [[Harvard College Observatory]] on March 13, 1930.<ref name="Hoyt" />

=== Name ===
The discovery made headlines around the globe.<ref>For example: "Ninth Planet Discovered on Edge of Solar System: First Found in 84 Years". ''Associated Press''. The New York Times. March 14, 1930. p. 1.</ref> Lowell Observatory, which had the right to name the new object, received more than 1,000 suggestions from all over the world, ranging from Atlas to Zymal.<ref name="pluto guide" /> Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else did.<ref name="pluto guide" /> Constance Lowell proposed ''[[Zeus]]'', then ''Percival'' and finally ''Constance''. These suggestions were disregarded.<ref name="Mager" /><!-- self-published source -->

The name Pluto, after the [[Pluto (mythology)|god of the underworld]], was proposed by [[Venetia Burney]] (1918–2009), an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in [[Oxford]], England, who was interested in [[classical mythology]].<ref name="Venetia" /> She suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather [[Falconer Madan]], a former librarian at the [[University of Oxford]]'s [[Bodleian Library]], who passed the name to astronomy professor [[Herbert Hall Turner]], who cabled it to colleagues in the United States.<ref name="Venetia" />

Each member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three potential names: [[Minerva]] (which was already the name for an asteroid), [[Cronus]] (which had lost reputation through being proposed by the unpopular astronomer [[Thomas Jefferson Jackson See]]), and Pluto. Pluto received every vote.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|pp=54–55}} The name was announced on May 1, 1930.<ref name="Venetia" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Pluto Research at Lowell |url=https://lowell.edu/in-depth/pluto/pluto-research-at-lowell/ |website=Lowell Observatory |accessdate=March 22, 2017 |quote=In a Lowell Observatory Circular dated May 1, 1930, the Observatory designated Pluto as the name for the new planet, based on the suggestion of 11-year-old Venetia Burney of England. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418140312/http://lowell.edu/in-depth/pluto/pluto-research-at-lowell/ |archive-date=April 18, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Upon the announcement, Madan gave Venetia £5 (equivalent to {{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|5|1930|2014|r=-2}}}} [[GBP]], or 450 [[USD]] in 2014){{Inflation-fn|UK}} as a reward.<ref name="Venetia" />

The final choice of name was helped in part by the fact that the first two letters of ''Pluto'' are the initials of Percival Lowell. Pluto's [[astronomical symbol]] {{nowrap|([[File:Pluto symbol.svg|20px]],}} [[Unicode]] U+2647, ♇) was then created as a [[monogram]] constructed from the letters "PL".<ref name="JPL/NASA Pluto's Symbol" /> Pluto's [[astrological symbol]] resembles that of Neptune {{nowrap|([[File:Neptune symbol.svg|20px]])}}, but has a circle in place of the middle prong of the trident {{nowrap|([[File:Pluto's astrological symbol.svg|20px]])}}.

The name was soon embraced by wider culture. In 1930, [[Walt Disney]] was apparently inspired by it when he introduced for [[Mickey Mouse]] a canine companion named [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], although [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animator [[Ben Sharpsteen]] could not confirm why the name was given.<ref name="Heinrichs2006" /> In 1941, [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] named the newly created [[Chemical element|element]] [[plutonium]] after Pluto, in keeping with the tradition of naming elements after newly discovered planets, following [[uranium]], which was named after Uranus, and [[neptunium]], which was named after Neptune.<ref name="ClarkHobart2000" />

Most languages use the name "Pluto" in various transliterations.{{efn|The equivalence is less close in languages whose [[phonology]] differs widely from [[Ancient Greek phonology|Greek's]], such as [[Somali language|Somali]] ''Buluuto'' and [[Navajo language|Navajo]] ''Tłóotoo''.}} In Japanese, [[Houei Nojiri]] suggested the translation {{nihongo3|"Star of the King (God) of the Underworld"|冥王星|Meiōsei}}, and this was borrowed into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese (which instead uses "Sao Diêm Vương", which was derived from the Chinese term 閻王 ([[Yama (East Asia)|Yánwáng]]), as "minh" is a homophone for the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] words for "dark" (冥) and "bright" (明)).<ref name="RenshawIhara2000" /><ref name="nineplan" /><ref name="Bathrobe" /> Some [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] use the name Pluto, but others, such as [[Hindi]], use the name of ''[[Yama]]'', the God of Death in [[Hindu]] and [[Yama (East Asia)|Buddhist]] mythology.<ref name="nineplan" /> [[Polynesian languages]] also tend to use the indigenous god of the underworld, as in [[Māori language|Māori]] ''[[Whiro]]''.<ref name="nineplan" />

=== Planet X disproved ===
Once Pluto was found, its faintness and lack of a resolvable disc cast doubt on the idea that it was Lowell's [[planets beyond Neptune|Planet X]].<ref name="Tombaugh1946" /> Estimates of Pluto's mass were revised downward throughout the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Stern|first1 = Alan|last2 = Tholen|first2 = David James|title = Pluto and Charon|date = 1997|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn = 978-0-8165-1840-1|pages=206–208}}</ref>

Astronomers initially calculated its mass based on its presumed effect on Neptune and Uranus. In 1931, Pluto was calculated to be roughly the mass of [[Earth]], with further calculations in 1948 bringing the mass down to roughly that of [[Mars]].<ref name="Nicholson et al 1930" /><ref name="Kuiper 10.1086/126255" /> In 1976, Dale Cruikshank, Carl Pilcher and David Morrison of the [[University of Hawaii]] calculated Pluto's [[Albedo#Astronomical albedo|albedo]] for the first time, finding that it matched that for methane ice; this meant Pluto had to be exceptionally luminous for its size and therefore could not be more than 1 percent the mass of Earth.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=57}} (Pluto's albedo is {{nowrap|1.4–1.9}} times that of Earth.<ref name="Pluto Fact Sheet" />)

In 1978, the discovery of Pluto's moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] allowed the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth, and far too small to account for the discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by [[Robert Sutton Harrington]],<ref name="SeidelmannHarrington1988" /> failed. In 1992, [[E. Myles Standish|Myles Standish]] used data from ''[[Voyager 2]]'''s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished.<ref name="Standish1993" /> Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.<ref name="Standage2000" /> Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual orbit and its position at that time; [[Ernest W. Brown]] concluded soon after Pluto's discovery that this was a coincidence,<ref name="Tenn1994" /> a view still held today.<ref name="Standish1993" />

{{Further|Definition of planet}}
{{TNO imagemap}}

From 1992 onward, many bodies were discovered orbiting in the same volume as Pluto, showing that Pluto is part of a population of objects called the [[Kuiper belt]]. This made its official status as a planet controversial, with many questioning whether Pluto should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding population. Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting Pluto from planetary models of the Solar System. The [[Hayden Planetarium]] reopened—in February 2000, after renovation—with a model of only eight planets, which made headlines almost a year later.<ref name="Tyson2001" />

As objects increasingly closer in size to Pluto were discovered in the region, it was argued that Pluto should be reclassified as one of the Kuiper belt objects, just as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[3 Juno|Juno]] and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] lost their planet status after the discovery of many other [[asteroid]]s. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at [[Caltech]] announced the discovery of a new [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the [[tenth planet]], although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet.<ref name="NASA-JPL press release 07-29-2005" /> Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.<ref>{{cite journal |title=What Is a Planet? |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=2513–2519 |date=November 2, 2006 |doi=10.1086/508861 |last1 = Soter|first1 = Steven|bibcode=2006AJ....132.2513S |arxiv=astro-ph/0608359 }}</ref>

==== IAU classification ====
{{Main|IAU definition of planet}}

The debate came to a head in August 2006, with an [[IAU definition of planet|IAU resolution]] that created an official definition for the term "planet". According to this resolution, there are three conditions for an object in the [[Solar System]] to be considered a planet:
# The object must be in orbit around the [[Sun]].
# The object must be massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity. More specifically, its own gravity should pull it into a shape defined by [[hydrostatic equilibrium]].
# It must have [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared the neighborhood]] around its orbit.<ref name="IAU2006 GA26-5-6" /><ref name="IAU0603" />

There has been some resistance within the astronomical community toward the reclassification.<ref name="geoff2006c" /><ref name="Ruibal-1999" /><ref name="Britt-2006" /> [[Alan Stern]], principal investigator with [[NASA]]'s ''New Horizons'' mission to Pluto, derided the IAU resolution, stating that "the definition stinks, for technical reasons".<ref name="geoff2006a" /> Stern contended that, by the terms of the new definition, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune, all of which share their orbits with asteroids, would be excluded.<ref name="newscientistspace" /> He argued that all big spherical moons, including the [[Moon]], should likewise be considered planets.<ref name="News.discovery.com" /> He also stated that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community.<ref name="newscientistspace" /> [[Marc W. Buie]], then at the Lowell Observatory petitioned against the definition.<ref name="Buie2006 IAU response" /> Others have supported the IAU. [[Michael E.

Science is self-correcting eventually, even when strong emotions are involved."<ref name="Overbye2006" />

Public reception to the IAU decision was mixed. Many accepted the reclassification, but some sought to overturn the decision with online petitions urging the IAU to consider reinstatement. A resolution introduced by some members of the [[California State Assembly]] facetiously called the IAU decision a "scientific heresy".<ref name="DeVore2006" /> The [[New Mexico House of Representatives]] passed a resolution in honor of Tombaugh, a longtime resident of that state, that declared that Pluto will always be considered a planet while in New Mexican skies and that March 13, 2007, was Pluto Planet Day.<ref name="Holden2007" /><ref name="Gutierrez2007" /> The [[Illinois Senate]] passed a similar resolution in 2009, on the basis that Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto, was born in Illinois. The resolution asserted that Pluto was "unfairly downgraded to a 'dwarf' planet" by the IAU."<ref name="ILGA SR0046" /> Some members of the public have also rejected the change, citing the disagreement within the scientific community on the issue, or for sentimental reasons, maintaining that they have always known Pluto as a planet and will continue to do so regardless of the IAU decision.<ref name="Sapa-AP" />

In 2006, in its 17th annual words-of-the-year vote, the [[American Dialect Society]] voted ''[[plutoed]]'' as the word of the year. To "pluto" is to "demote or devalue someone or something".<ref name="msnbc" />

Pluto's orbital period is currently about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially different from those of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] called the [[ecliptic]]. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately [[orbital inclination|inclined]] relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and moderately [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] ([[elliptical]]). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies closer to the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came to [[apsis|perihelion]] on September 5, 1989,<ref name="jpl-ssd-horizons" />{{efn|name = Perihelion}} and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.<ref name="pluto990209" />

In the long term, Pluto's orbit is [[chaos theory|chaotic]]. Computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several million years (both [[time reversibility|forward and backward]] in time), but after intervals longer than the [[Lyapunov time]] of 10–20 million years, calculations become speculative: Pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of the Solar System, hard-to-predict factors that will gradually change Pluto's position in its orbit.<ref name="sussman88" /><ref name="wisdom91" />

The [[semi-major axis]] of Pluto's orbit varies between about 39.3 and 39.6&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|au]] with a period of about 19,951 years, corresponding to an orbital period varying between 246 and 249 years. The semi-major axis and period are presently getting longer.<ref name=williams71 />

}}

=== Relationship with Neptune ===
Despite Pluto's orbit appearing to cross that of Neptune when viewed from directly above, the two objects' orbits are aligned so that they can never collide or even approach closely.

The two orbits do not intersect. When Pluto is closest to the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed from above, it is also the farthest above Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 [[astronomical unit|AU]] above that of Neptune, preventing a collision.<ref name="huainn01" /><ref name="Hunter2004" /><ref name="malhotra-9planets" />

This alone is not enough to protect Pluto; [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its [[apsidal precession|orbital precession]]) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. However, Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 [[orbital resonance]] with [[Neptune]]: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near [[perihelion]], Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17&nbsp;AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11&nbsp;AU).<ref name="malhotra-9planets" /> The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.<ref name=williams71 />

The 2:3 resonance between the two bodies is highly stable, and has been preserved over millions of years.<ref name="sp-345" /> This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another, and so the two bodies can never pass near each other. Even if Pluto's orbit were not inclined, the two bodies could never collide.<ref name="malhotra-9planets" /> The long term stability of the mean-motion resonance is due to phase protection. If Pluto's period is slightly shorter than 3/2 of Neptune, its orbit relative to Neptune will drift, causing it to make closer approaches behind Neptune's orbit. The strong gravitational pull between the two causes [[angular momentum]] to be transferred to Pluto, at Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it travels slightly more slowly, according to [[Kepler's third law]]. After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune sufficiently sped up, that Pluto orbit relative to Neptune drifts in the opposite direction until the process is reversed. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete.<ref name="malhotra-9planets" /><ref name="sp-345" /><ref name="Cohen_Hubbard_1965">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=C. J.|last2=Hubbard|first2=E.

==== Other factors ====
Numerical studies have shown that over millions of years, the general nature of the alignment between the orbits of Pluto and Neptune does not change.<ref name="huainn01" /><ref name="williams71" /> There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).

First, Pluto's [[argument of perihelion]], the angle between the point where it crosses the ecliptic and the point where it is closest to the Sun, [[libration|librates]] around 90°.<ref name="williams71" /> This means that when Pluto is closest to the Sun, it is at its farthest above the plane of the Solar System, preventing encounters with Neptune. This is a consequence of the [[Kozai mechanism]],<ref name="huainn01" /> which relates the eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination to a larger perturbing body—in this case Neptune. Relative to Neptune, the amplitude of libration is 38°, and so the angular separation of Pluto's perihelion to the orbit of Neptune is always greater than 52° {{nowrap|(90°–38°)}}. The closest such angular separation occurs every 10,000 years.<ref name="sp-345" />

Second, the longitudes of ascending nodes of the two bodies—the points where they cross the ecliptic—are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same—that is, when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun—Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90°, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is highest above Neptune's orbit. This is known as the ''1:1 superresonance''. All the [[Jovian planets]], particularly Jupiter, play a role in the creation of the superresonance.<ref name="huainn01" />

=== Quasi-satellite ===
In 2012, it was hypothesized that [[15810 Arawn]] could be a [[quasi-satellite]] of Pluto, a specific type of co-orbital configuration.<ref name="quasi" /> According to the hypothesis, the object would be a quasi-satellite of Pluto for about 350,000 years out of every two-million-year period.<ref name="quasi" /><ref name="S&T" /> Measurements made by the ''New Horizons'' spacecraft in 2015 made it possible to calculate the orbit of Arawn more accurately.<ref name="2016maynasa">{{cite web|title=New Horizons Collects First Science on a Post-Pluto Object|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-collects-first-science-on-a-post-pluto-object|publisher=NASA|date=2016-05-13}}</ref> These calculations confirm the overall dynamics described in the hypothesis.<ref name=analemma>{{cite journal |title=The analemma criterion: accidental quasi-satellites are indeed true quasi-satellites |url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/07/27/mnras.stw1833.abstract |first=Carlos |last=de la Fuente Marcos |last2=de la Fuente Marcos |first2=Raúl |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=2016 |volume=462 |issue=3 |pages=3344–3349 |arxiv=1607.06686 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw1833 |bibcode=2016MNRAS.462.3344D}}</ref> However, it is not agreed upon among astronomers whether Arawn should be classified as a quasi-satellite of Pluto based on this motion, since its orbit is primarily controlled by Neptune with only occasional smaller perturbations caused by Pluto.<ref name=porter_et_al_2016>{{cite journal |title=The First High-phase Observations of a KBO: New Horizons Imaging of (15810) 1994 JR1 from the Kuiper Belt |first=Simon B. |last=Porter |display-authors=etal |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=828 |issue=2 |pages=L15 |date=2016 |arxiv=1605.05376 |bibcode=2016ApJ...828L..15P |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/828/2/L15}}</ref><ref name="2016maynasa" /><ref name=analemma />

== Rotation ==
Pluto's [[rotation period]], its day, is equal to 6.39 [[Earth]] days.<ref name="axis" /> Like [[Uranus]], Pluto rotates on its "side" in its orbital plane, with an axial tilt of 120°, and so its seasonal variation is extreme; at its [[solstice]]s, one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight, whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness.<ref name="oregon" /> The reason for this unusual orientation has been debated. Research from the [[University of Arizona]] has suggested that it may be due to the way that a body's spin will always adjust to minimise energy. This could mean a body reorienting itself to put extraneous mass near the equator and regions lacking mass tend towards the poles. This is called ''[[polar wander]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kirschvink|first=Joseph L.|last2=Ripperdan|first2=Robert L.|last3=Evans|first3=David A.|date=July 25, 1997|title=Evidence for a Large-Scale Reorganization of Early Cambrian Continental Masses by Inertial Interchange True Polar Wander|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/277/5325/541|journal=Science|language=en|volume=277|issue=5325|pages=541–545|doi=10.1126/science.277.5325.541|issn=0036-8075}}</ref> According to a paper released from the University of Arizona, this could be caused by masses of frozen nitrogen building up in shadowed areas of the dwarf planet. These masses would cause the body to reorient itself, leading to its unusual axial tilt of 120°. The buildup of nitrogen is due to Pluto's vast distance from the Sun. At the equator, temperatures can drop to {{convert|-240|C|F K}}, causing nitrogen to freeze as water would freeze on Earth. The same effect seen on Pluto would be observed on Earth if the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] was several times larger.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keane|first=James T.|last2=Matsuyama|first2=Isamu|last3=Kamata|first3=Shunichi|last4=Steckloff|first4=Jordan K.|title=Reorientation and faulting of Pluto due to volatile loading within Sputnik Planitia|journal=Nature|volume=540|issue=7631|pages=90–93|doi=10.1038/nature20120|pmid=27851731|bibcode = 2016Natur.540...90K |year=2016}}</ref>

Pluto's density is {{val|1.860|0.013|u=g/cm3}}.<ref name="Stern2015" /> Because the decay of radioactive elements would eventually heat the ices enough for the rock to separate from them, scientists expect that Pluto's internal structure is differentiated, with the rocky material having settled into a dense [[Core (geology)|core]] surrounded by a [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] of water ice. The diameter of the core is hypothesized to be approximately {{val|1700|u=km}}, 70% of Pluto's diameter.<ref name="Hussmann2006" /> It is possible that such heating continues today, creating a [[subsurface ocean]] of liquid water {{nowrap|100 to 180 km}} thick at the core–mantle boundary.<ref name="Hussmann2006" /><ref name="pluto.jhuapl Inside Story" /><ref name='Sci Am 2017'>[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/overlooked-ocean-worlds-fill-the-outer-solar-system/ Overlooked Ocean Worlds Fill the Outer Solar System].

Pluto's diameter is {{val|2376.6|3.2|u=km}}<ref name="Nimmo2017" /> and its mass is {{val|1.303|0.003|e=22|u=kg}}, 17.7% that of the [[Moon]] (0.22% that of Earth).<ref name="Davies2001" /> Its [[surface area]] is {{val|1.779|e=7|u=km2}}, or roughly the same surface area as [[Russia]]. Its [[surface gravity]] is 0.063 ''g'' (compared to 1 ''g'' for Earth).

The discovery of Pluto's satellite [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] in 1978 enabled a determination of the mass of the Pluto–Charon system by application of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Deriving Kepler's third law|Newton's formulation of Kepler's third law]]. Observations of Pluto in occultation with Charon allowed scientists to establish Pluto's diameter more accurately, whereas the invention of [[adaptive optics]] allowed them to determine its shape more accurately.<ref name="Close_2000" />

With less than 0.2 lunar masses, Pluto is much less massive than the [[terrestrial planet]]s, and also less massive than seven [[natural satellite|moons]]: [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Io (moon)|Io]], the [[Moon]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and Triton.

Pluto has five known [[natural satellite]]s. The closest to Pluto is [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]. First identified in 1978 by astronomer [[James W. Christy|James Christy]], Charon is the only moon of Pluto in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]; Charon's mass is sufficient to cause the barycenter of the Pluto–Charon system to be outside Pluto. Beyond Charon there are four much smaller [[circumbinary]] moons. In order of distance from Pluto they are Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. [[Nix (moon)|Nix]] and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]] were both discovered in 2005,<ref name="Gugliotta2005" /> [[Kerberos (moon)|Kerberos]] was discovered in 2011,<ref name="P4" /> and [[Styx (moon)|Styx]] was discovered in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/16531-pluto-fifth-moon-hubble-discovery.html |title=Pluto Has a Fifth Moon, Hubble Telescope Reveals |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=July 11, 2012 |work=Space.com |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref> The satellites' orbits are circular (eccentricity < 0.006) and coplanar with Pluto's equator (inclination < 1°),<ref name="Buie2012">{{cite journal |journal=The Astronomical Journal |last1=Buie |first1=M. |last2=Tholen |first2=D. |last3=Grundy |first3=W. |title=The Orbit of Charon is Circular |year=2012 |volume=144 |issue=1 |pages=15 |doi=10.1088/0004-6256/144/1/15 |bibcode=2012AJ....144...15B}}</ref><ref name="ShowalterHamilton2015" /> and therefore tilted approximately 120° relative to Pluto's orbit.

The Pluto–Charon system is one of the few in the Solar System whose barycenter lies outside the primary body; the [[617 Patroclus|Patroclus–Menoetius]] system is a smaller example, and the [[Jupiter#Mass and size|Sun–Jupiter]] system is the only larger one.<ref name="RichardsonWalsh2005" /> The similarity in size of Charon and Pluto has prompted some astronomers to call it a [[double planet|double dwarf planet]].<ref name="Sicardyetal2006nature" /> The system is also unusual among planetary systems in that each is [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to the other, which means that Pluto and Charon always have the same hemisphere facing each other. From any position on either body, the other is always at the same position in the sky, or always obscured.<ref name="Young1997" /> This also means that the rotation period of each is equal to the time it takes the entire system to rotate around its barycenter.<ref name="axis" />

In 2007, observations by the [[Gemini Observatory]] of patches of ammonia hydrates and water crystals on the surface of Charon suggested the presence of active cryo-geysers.<ref name="spaceflightnow2007 Ice machine" />

Pluto's true place in the [[Solar System]] began to reveal itself only in 1992, when astronomers began to find small icy objects beyond Neptune that were similar to Pluto not only in orbit but also in size and composition. This trans-Neptunian population is thought to be the source of many [[short-period comet]]s. Pluto is now known to be the largest member of the [[Kuiper belt]],{{efn|name = wiki-kbo}} a stable belt of objects located between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun. As of 2011, surveys of the Kuiper belt to magnitude 21 were nearly complete and any remaining Pluto-sized objects are expected to be beyond 100&nbsp;AU from the Sun.<ref name="Sheppard2011" /> Like other Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs), Pluto shares features with [[comet]]s; for example, the [[solar wind]] is gradually blowing Pluto's surface into space.<ref name="pluto.jhuapl cousin" /> It has been claimed that if Pluto were placed as near to the Sun as Earth, it would develop a tail, as comets do.<ref name="Tyson1999" /> This claim has been disputed with the argument that Pluto's escape velocity is too high for this to happen.<ref>[http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/nine-reasons-why-pluto-is-a-planet/ "Nine Reasons Why Pluto Is a Planet"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415183323/http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/nine-reasons-why-pluto-is-a-planet/ |date=April 15, 2015 }} by Philip Metzger</ref> Nonetheless, it has also been claimed that Pluto may have formed as a result of the agglomeration of numerous comets and related Kuiper belt objects.<ref name="SP-20180524">{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Pluto May Have Formed from 1 Billion Comets |url=https://www.space.com/40687-pluto-formation-1-billion-comets.html |date=May 24, 2018 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=May 24, 2018 }}</ref><ref name="ARX-20180524">{{Cite journal|last1=Glein |first1=Christopher R. |last2=Waite, Jr |first2=J.

Though Pluto is the largest Kuiper belt object discovered,<ref name="Plutosize" /> Neptune's moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], which is slightly larger than Pluto, is similar to it both geologically and atmospherically, and is thought to be a captured Kuiper belt object.<ref name="PlanetaryOrg Triton" /> Eris ([[#Classification|see above]]) is about the same size as Pluto (though more massive) but is not strictly considered a member of the Kuiper belt population. Rather, it is considered a member of a linked population called the [[scattered disc]].

A large number of Kuiper belt objects, like Pluto, are in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune. KBOs with this orbital resonance are called "[[plutino]]s", after Pluto.<ref name="Jewitt2004" />

Like other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is thought to be a residual [[planetesimal]]; a component of the original [[protoplanetary disc]] around the [[Sun]] that failed to fully coalesce into a full-fledged planet. Most astronomers agree that Pluto owes its current position to a [[planetary migration|sudden migration]] undergone by Neptune early in the Solar System's formation. As Neptune migrated outward, it approached the objects in the proto-Kuiper belt, setting one in orbit around itself (Triton), locking others into resonances, and knocking others into chaotic orbits. The objects in the [[scattered disc]], a dynamically unstable region overlapping the Kuiper belt, are thought to have been placed in their current positions by interactions with Neptune's migrating resonances.<ref name="Hahn2005" /> A computer model created in 2004 by Alessandro Morbidelli of the [[Côte d'Azur Observatory|Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur]] in [[Nice]] suggested that the migration of Neptune into the Kuiper belt may have been triggered by the formation of a 1:2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn, which created a gravitational push that propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits and caused them to switch places, ultimately doubling Neptune's distance from the Sun. The resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt could also explain the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] 600&nbsp;million years after the Solar System's formation and the origin of the [[Jupiter trojan]]s.<ref name="Levison2007" /> It is possible that Pluto had a near-circular orbit about 33 AU from the Sun before Neptune's migration [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] it into a resonant capture.<ref name="Malhotra1995" /> The [[Nice model]] requires that there were about a thousand Pluto-sized bodies in the original planetesimal disk, which included Triton and Eris.<ref name="Levison2007" />

== Observation and exploration ==
Pluto's distance from Earth makes its in-depth study and [[Space exploration|exploration]] difficult. On July 14, 2015, NASA's ''[[New Horizons]]'' space probe flew through the Pluto system, providing much information about it.<ref name="NASA-20160317-sci">{{cite web |last=Talbert |first=Tricia |title=Top New Horizons Findings Reported in Science |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/top-new-horizons-findings-reported-in-science |date=March 17, 2016 |work=NASA |accessdate=March 18, 2016 }}</ref>

=== Observation ===
[[File:Pluto animiert 200px.gif|thumb|Computer-generated rotating image of Pluto based on observations by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in 2002–2003]]
Pluto's visual [[apparent magnitude]] averages 15.1, brightening to 13.65 at perihelion.<ref name="Pluto Fact Sheet" /> To see it, a telescope is required; around 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) aperture being desirable.<ref name="SSC2002" /> It looks star-like and without a visible disk even in large telescopes, because its [[angular diameter]] is only 0.11".

The earliest maps of Pluto, made in the late 1980s, were brightness maps created from close observations of eclipses by its largest moon, Charon. Observations were made of the change in the total average brightness of the Pluto–Charon system during the eclipses. For example, eclipsing a bright spot on Pluto makes a bigger total brightness change than eclipsing a dark spot. Computer processing of many such observations can be used to create a brightness map. This method can also track changes in brightness over time.<ref name="YoungBinzelCrane2001" /><ref name="BuieTholenHorne1992" />

Better maps were produced from images taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST), which offered higher [[angular resolution|resolution]], and showed considerably more detail,<ref name="Buie_web_map" /> resolving variations several hundred kilometers across, including polar regions and large bright spots.<ref name="Buie_2010 surface-maps" /> These maps were produced by complex computer processing, which finds the best-fit projected maps for the few pixels of the Hubble images.<ref name="Buie_mapmaking" /> These remained the most detailed maps of Pluto until the flyby of ''New Horizons'' in July 2015, because the two cameras on the HST used for these maps were no longer in service.<ref name="Buie_mapmaking" />

=== Exploration ===
{{Main|Exploration of Pluto|New Horizons|}}
[[File:Pluto-Map-Annotated.jpg|thumb|The portions of Pluto's surface mapped by ''New Horizons'' (annotated)]]
The ''New Horizons'' spacecraft, which [[planetary flyby|flew by]] Pluto in July 2015, is the first and so far only attempt to explore Pluto directly. Launched in 2006, it captured its first (distant) images of Pluto in late September 2006 during a test of the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager.<ref name="pluto.jhuapl First Pluto Sighting" /> The images, taken from a distance of approximately 4.2 billion kilometers, confirmed the spacecraft's ability to track distant targets, critical for maneuvering toward Pluto and other Kuiper belt objects. In early 2007 the craft made use of a [[gravity assist]] from [[Jupiter]].

''New Horizons'' made its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015, after a 3,462-day journey across the Solar System. Scientific observations of Pluto began five months before the closest approach and continued for at least a month after the encounter. Observations were conducted using a [[remote sensing]] package that included [[digital imaging|imaging]] instruments and a radio science investigation tool, as well as [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] and other experiments. The scientific goals of ''New Horizons'' were to characterize the global geology and morphology of Pluto and its moon Charon, map their surface composition, and analyze Pluto's neutral atmosphere and its escape rate.  On October 25, 2016, at 05:48 pm ET, the last bit of data (of a total of 50 billion bits of data; or 6.25 gigabytes) was received from ''New Horizons'' from its close encounter with Pluto.<ref name="NYT-20161028">{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=No More Data From Pluto |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/science/pluto-nasa-new-horizons.html |date=October 28, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=October 28, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web

Since the ''New Horizons'' flyby, scientists have advocated for an orbiter mission that would return to Pluto to fulfill new science objectives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/26/15424770/nasa-spacecraft-new-horizons-flyby-pluto-moons-orbiter-mission|title=Why a group of scientists think we need another mission to Pluto|work=The Verge|access-date=July 14, 2018}}</ref> They include mapping the surface at 30 feet per pixel, observations of Pluto's smaller satellites, observations of how Pluto changes as it rotates on its axis, and topographic mapping of Pluto's regions that are covered in long-term darkness due to its axial tilt. The last objective could be accomplished using laser pulses to generate a complete topographic map of Pluto. ''New Horizons'' principal investigator Alan Stern has advocated for a [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'']]-style orbiter that would launch around 2030 (the 100th anniversary of Pluto's discovery) and use Charon's gravity to adjust its orbit as needed to fulfill science objectives after arriving at the Pluto system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/36697-pluto-orbiter-mission-after-new-horizons.html|title=Going Back to Pluto? Scientists to Push for Orbiter Mission|work=Space.com|access-date=July 14, 2018}}</ref> The orbiter could then use Charon's gravity to leave the Pluto system and study more KBOs after all Pluto science objectives are completed. A conceptual study funded by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts ([[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|NIAC]]) program describes a fusion-enabled Pluto orbiter and lander based on the [[Princeton field-reversed configuration experiment|Princeton field-reversed configuration reactor]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2017_Phase_I_Phase_II/Fusion_Enabled_Pluto_Orbiter_and_Lander|title=Fusion-Enabled Pluto Orbiter and Lander|last=Hall|first=Loura|date=April 5, 2017|work=NASA|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref name='PSS'>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170003126.pdf Fusion-Enabled Pluto Orbiter and Lander - Phase I Final Report].

{{efn| name = Perihelion| 1 = The discovery of Charon in 1978 allowed astronomers to accurately calculate the mass of the Plutonian system. But it did not indicate the two bodies' individual masses, which could only be estimated after other moons of Pluto were discovered in late 2005. As a result, because Pluto came to perihelion in 1989, most Pluto perihelion date estimates are based on the Pluto–Charon [[barycenter]].
