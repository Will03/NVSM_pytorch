'''Space food''' is a type of food product created and [[Food processing|processed]] for consumption by [[astronaut]]s in [[outer space]]. The food has specific requirements of providing balanced nutrition for individuals working in space, while being easy and safe to store, prepare and consume in the machinery-filled [[Weightlessness|weightless]] environments of manned [[spacecraft]].

In recent years, space food has been used by various nations engaging on space programs as a way to share and show off their [[cultural identity]] and facilitate [[intercultural communication]]. Although astronauts consume a wide variety of foods and beverages in space, the initial idea from The Man in Space Committee of the Space Science Board in 1963 was to supply astronauts with a formula diet that would supply all the needed vitamins and nutrients.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12419/working-group-on-nutrition-and-feeding-problems |title=Working Group on Nutrition and Feeding Problems |publisher=The National Academies Press |date=April 1963 |doi=10.17226/12419}}</ref>

==Early history==
[[File:AstronautsEatingBurgers.jpg|thumb|right|Astronauts making and eating hamburgers on board the ISS August 2007.]]

For lunch on Vostok I (1961) [[Yuri Gagarin]] ate from three 160 g toothpaste-type tubes, two of which contained servings of puréed meat and one which contained chocolate sauce.

In August 1961, Soviet Cosmonaut [[Gherman Titov]] became the first human to experience [[space sickness]] on Vostok II; he holds the record for being the first person to vomit in space.<ref name="Guinness2012">{{cite book |title=Guinness World Records 2013 |publisher=Guinness World Records |editor-first=Craig |editor-last=Glenday |page=27 |date=2012 |isbn=9781904994879}}</ref> According to Lane and Feeback, this event "heralded the need for space flight nutrition."<ref name="Lane2002">{{cite journal |title=History of nutrition in space flight |journal=Nutrition |first1=Helen W. |last1=Lane |first2=Daniel L. |last2=Feeback |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=797–804 |date=October 2002 |doi=10.1016/S0899-9007(02)00946-2}}</ref>

One of [[John Glenn]]'s many tasks, as the first American to orbit Earth in 1962, was to experiment with eating in weightless conditions. Some experts had been concerned that weightlessness would impair swallowing. Glenn experienced no such difficulties and it was determined that [[microgravity]] did not affect the natural [[swallowing]] process, which is enabled by the [[peristalsis]] of the [[esophagus]].

Astronauts in later [[Project Mercury|Mercury missions]] (1959–1963) disliked the food that was provided. They ate bite-sized cubes, freeze-dried powders, and tubes of semiliquids. The astronauts found it unappetizing, experienced difficulties in rehydrating the freeze-dried foods, and did not like having to squeeze tubes or collect crumbs.<ref name=FFSF/> Prior to the mission, the astronauts were also fed [[Low residue diet|''low residual'']] launch-day breakfasts, to reduce the chances that they would defecate in flight.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.americaspace.com/?p=18434 |title="Why Postpone a Success?" The Days Before Freedom 7 |first=Ben |last=Evans |publisher=AmericaSpace, LLC}}</ref>

===Project Gemini and Apollo (1965–1975)===
Several of the food issues from the Mercury missions were addressed for the later [[Project Gemini|Gemini missions]] (1965–1966). Tubes (often heavier than the foods they contained) were abandoned. Gelatin coatings helped to prevent bite-sized cubes from crumbling. Simpler rehydration methods were developed. The menus also expanded to include items such as shrimp cocktail, chicken and vegetables, toast squares, butterscotch pudding, and apple juice.<ref name=FFSF/>

The crew of [[Gemini III]] sneaked a [[corned beef sandwich]] on their spaceflight. Mission Commander [[Gus Grissom]] loved corned beef sandwiches, so Pilot [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] brought one along, having been encouraged by fellow astronaut [[Walter Schirra]]. However, Young was supposed to eat only approved food, and Grissom was not supposed to eat anything. Floating pieces of bread posed a potential problem, causing Grissom to put the sandwich away (although he did enjoy it)<ref>[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/GT03_TEC.PDF Voice Transcript of GT-3], p. 45 NASA.gov</ref> and the astronauts were mildly rebuked by [[NASA]] for the act. A congressional hearing was called, forcing the NASA deputy administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] to promise no repeats. NASA took special care about what astronauts brought along on future missions.<ref>[https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/zorn/grissom.htm Detailed Biographies of Apollo I Crew - Gus Grissom] NASA.gov</ref><ref>[http://www.spaceline.org/flightchron/gemini3.html Gemini III Fact Sheet] Spaceline.org</ref><ref>De Groot, Gerard. ''Dark Side of the Moon: The Magnificent Madness of the American Lunar Quest''. (NYU Press, 2006), p.190</ref>

Prior to the Apollo program (1968–1975), early space food development was conducted at the US Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine and the [[Natick Army Labs]].<ref name="Lane2002"/> The variety of food options continued to expand for the [[Apollo program|Apollo missions]]. The new availability of hot water made rehydrating freeze-dried foods simpler, and produced a more appetizing result. The "spoon-bowl" allowed more normal eating practices. Food could be kept in special plastic zip-closure containers, and its moisture allowed it to stick to a spoon.<ref name=FFSF/>

===Apollo 11 (1969)===
On Sunday, 20 July 1969, [[Buzz Aldrin]], on the moon, partook of the Presbyterian Christian sacrament of [[Holy Communion]], which had been consecrated by his pastor, the Rev. Dean Woodruff, two weeks prior to the space mission.<ref name="Alrdin1969">{{cite news |url=https://www.guideposts.org/better-living/life-advice/finding-life-purpose/guideposts-classics-buzz-aldrin-on-communion-in-space |title=Guideposts Classics: Buzz Aldrin on Communion in Space |publisher=[[Guideposts]] |first=Buzz |last=Aldrin |author-link=Buzz Aldrin |date=14 July 2014 |accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref>

Aldrin received the Eucharist in the same hour that his local church did on that Sunday Sabbath and he later stated that "I sensed especially strongly my unity with our church back home, and with the Church everywhere".<ref name="Alrdin1969"/>

===Skylab (1973–1974)===
[[File:S73-20236.jpg|thumb|Skylab 2 crew eats food during ground training]]

Larger living areas on the [[Skylab]] space station (1973–1974) allowed for an on-board refrigerator and freezer, which allowed perishable and frozen items to be stored and made microgravity the primary obstacle.<ref name="livingandworking"/>{{rp|142–144}} When Skylab's solar panels were damaged during its launch and the station had to rely on minimal power from the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] until [[Skylab 2]] crewmembers performed repairs, the refrigerator and freezer were among the systems that Mission Control kept operational.

Menus included 72 items; for the first time about 15% was frozen. Shrimp cocktail and butter cookies were consistent favorites; [[Lobster Newburg]], fresh bread,{{r|bourland20060407}} processed meat products, and ice cream were among other choices. A dining room table and chairs, fastened to the floor and fitted with foot and thigh restraints, allowed for a more normal eating experience. The trays used could warm the food, and had magnets to hold eating utensils and scissors used for opening food containers.<ref name="livingandworking">Benson, Charles Dunlap and William David Compton.

After astronaut requests, NASA bought [[Paul Masson]] Rare [[Cream Sherry]] for one Skylab mission and packaged some for testing on a [[reduced gravity aircraft]]. In microgravity smells quickly permeate the environment and the agency found that the sherry triggered the [[gag reflex]]. Concern over public reaction to taking alcohol into space led NASA to abandon its plans, so astronauts drank the purchased supply while consuming their pre-mission special diet.<ref name=bourland20060407>{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/BourlandCT/BourlandCT_4-7-06.htm |title=Edited Oral History Transcript - Charles T.

The [[astronauts]] of the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] (1975) received samples of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space food when the combined crew dined together. Among the [[foods]] provided by [[Soyuz 19]] were [[canning|canned]] [[beef tongue]], [[packaging|packaged]] Riga [[bread]], and tubes of [[borscht]] (beet soup) and [[caviar]]. The borscht was labeled "[[vodka]]".<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2000/00-53.html Former Astronaut Recalls Historic Apollo-Soyuz Mission] NASA</ref>

===Interkosmos (1978–1988)===
[[File:Bulgarian space food.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian space food]]

As part of the [[Interkosmos]] space program, allies of the Soviet Union have actively participated in the research and deployment of space technologies. The  Institute of Cryobiology and Lyophilization (now the Institute of Cryobiology and Food Technology), founded in 1973 as a part of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]], has since produced space food for the purposes of the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ikht.bg/pages_eng/about_eng.html |title=About Us |publisher=Institute of Cryobiology and Food Technology |accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MG__CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA249&lpg=PA249 |title=Interkosmos: The Eastern Bloc's Early Space Program |publisher=Springer-Praxis |first1=Colin |last1=Burgess |first2=Bert |last2=Vis |page=249 |date=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-24161-6 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24163-0}}</ref> The menu includes traditional Bulgarian dishes such as [[tarator]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[moussaka|musaka]], [[ljutenica|lyutenitza]], [[yogurt|kiselo mlyako]], dried vegetables and fruits, etc.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.24chasa.bg/Article/850353 |title=В Космоса: яденето българско, сексът руски |trans-title=In the Cosmos: Eating Bulgarian, Russian Sex |website=24chasa.bg |language=bg |first=Yaroslava |last=Prohazkova |date=9 April 2011 |accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://delo.bg/world/balgariya-e-treta-v-sveta-po-proizvodstvo-na-hrana-za-kosmonavti/ |title=У нас е първата оранжерия за космическа храна в света |trans-title=In our country is the first greenhouse for space food in the world |website=Delo.bg |language=bg |first=Silvia |last=Vassileva |date=19 April 2015 |accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref>

==Modern==
Today, fruits and vegetables that can be safely stored at room temperature are eaten on space flights. Astronauts also have a greater variety of [[main course]]s to choose from, and many request personalized menus from lists of available foods including items like fruit salad and spaghetti. Astronauts sometimes request [[jerky (food)|beef jerky]] for flights, as it is lightweight, calorie dense, and can be consumed in orbit without packaging or other changes.

==Processing==
[[File:Russian space food.jpg|thumb|Russian space food]]

Designing food for consumption in space is an often difficult process. Foods must meet a number of criteria to be considered fit for space. Firstly, the food must be [[Physiology|physiologically]] appropriate. Specifically, it must be nutritious, easily digestible, and palatable. Secondly, the food must be engineered for consumption in a zero gravity environment. As such, the food must be light, well packaged, fast to serve and require minimal cleaning up.  (Foods that tend to leave crumbs, for example, are ill-suited for space.) Finally, foods require a minimum of energy expenditure throughout their use; they must store well, open easily and leave little waste behind.

Carbonated drinks have been tried in space, but are not favored due to changes in belching caused by microgravity; without gravity to separate the liquid and gas in the stomach, burping results in a kind of vomiting called "wet burping".<ref name=KloerisB>{{cite web |url=http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/people/journals/space/kloeris/05-01-01.html |title=Eating on the ISS |series=Field Journal |publisher=NASA |first=Vickie |last=Kloeris |date=May 1, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930025908/http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/people/journals/space/kloeris/05-01-01.html |archivedate=September 30, 2006 |quote=Because there is no gravity, the contents of your stomach float and tend to stay at the top of your stomach, under the rib cage and close to the valve at the top of your stomach. Because this valve isn't a complete closure (just a muscle that works with gravity), if you burp, it becomes a wet burp from the contents in your stomach.}}</ref> [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] were first carried on [[STS-51-F]] in 1985. Coca-Cola has flown on subsequent missions in a specially designed dispenser that utilizes [[BioServe Space Technologies]] hardware used for biochemical experiments. [[Space Station Mir]] carried cans of Pepsi in 1996.

[[Beer]] has also been developed that counteracts the reduction of taste and smell reception in space and reduces the possibility of wet belches (vomiting caused by belching) in microgravity. Produced by Vostok 4-Pines Stout, a parabolic flight experiment validated that the reduced carbonation recipe met the criteria intended for space.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.news.com.au/technology/vostok-beer-is-a-sturdy-stout-you-can-swig-in-space/news-story/d673d105eb1b255738de0fbbed316059 |title=How does space beer taste?

Space bread has proved elusive because of a variety of challenges. By 2012 a method was suggested where dough is leavened by dissolved {{chem2|CO2}} (as opposed to yeast) and cooked by a low-temperature process. This could allow fresh baked bread from bulk ingredients on future spaceflights.<ref name=daves>{{cite news |url=https://newatlas.com/spacebread/22768/ |title=How to bake bread in space |work=New Atlas |first=David |last=Szondy |date=June 3, 2012 |accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref>

==Packaging==
[[File:Space shuttle eating tray.jpg|thumb|left|Food tray used aboard the [[Space Shuttle]]]]
Packaging for space food serves the primary purposes of preserving and containing the food. The packaging, however, must also be light-weight, easy to dispose of and useful in the preparation of the food for consumption. The packaging also includes a bar-coded label, which allows for the tracking of an astronaut's diet. The labels also specify the food's preparation instructions in both [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].<ref name=KloerisB />

Many foods from the [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Russian space program]] are packaged in [[Tin can|can]]s and tins.<ref name=bourlandC>Bourland, Charles (2001) ''Packaging foods for flight''— NASA FTCSC News, July 2001</ref> These are heated through [[Joule heating|electro-resistive (ohmic)]] methods, opened with a can-opener, and the food inside consumed directly.

The trays include straps on the underside, allowing astronauts to attach the tray to an anchor point such as their legs or a wall surface and include clips for retaining a beverage pouch or utensils in the microgravity environment.

==Types==
[[File:ISSSpaceFoodsAssortment.jpg|thumb|Assortment of foods like those served aboard the ISS.]]
There are several classifications for food that is sent into space:<ref name=FFSF>{{cite web |author=NASA |accessdate=2006-12-12 |date=2002-04-07 |title=Food For Space Flight |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/factsheets/food.html |work=Fact Sheet Library}}</ref><ref name="NASA HRP">{{cite book |title=Human health and performance risks of space exploration missions : evidence reviewed by the NASA Human Research Program |date=2009 |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lyndon B.

*''Beverages (B)'' - Freeze dried drink mixes (coffee or tea) or flavored drinks (lemonade or orange drink) are provided in vacuum sealed beverage pouches. Coffee and tea may have powdered cream and/or sugar added depending on personal taste preferences. Empty beverage pouches are provided for drinking water.
*''Fresh Foods (FF)''- Fresh fruit, vegetables and tortillas delivered by resupply missions. These foods spoil quickly and need to be eaten within the first two days of flight to prevent spoilage. These foods are provided as psychological support.
*''Irradiated (I) Meat'' - Beef steak that is [[Food irradiation|sterilized with ionizing radiation]] to keep the food from spoiling. NASA has dispensation from the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to use this type of food sterilization.
*''Intermediate Moisture (IM)'' - Foods that have some moisture but not enough to cause immediate spoilage.
*''Natural Form (NF)'' - Commercially available, [[Shelf stable|shelf-stable]] foods such as nuts, cookies and granola bars that are ready to eat.
*''Rehydratable (R) Foods'' - Foods that have been dehydrated by various technologies (such as drying with heat, osmotic drying and freeze drying) and allowed to rehydrate in hot water prior to consumption. Reducing the water content reduces the ability of microorganisms to thrive.
*''Thermostabilized (T)'' - Also known as the retort process. This process heats foods to destroy [[pathogens]], [[microorganisms]] and [[enzymes]] that may cause [[Food spoilage|spoilage]].
*''Extended shelf-life bread products'' - Scones, waffles and rolls specially formulated to have a shelf life of up to 18 months.

More common staples and condiments do not have a classification and are known simply by the item name:
* ''Shelf Stable Tortillas'' - Tortillas that have been heat treated and specially packaged in an [[oxygen]]-free [[nitrogen]] atmosphere to prevent the growth of mold.
* ''Condiments'' - Liquid salt solution, oily pepper paste, mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard.

==Consumer derivatives==
Capitalizing on the popularity of the Apollo space missions, [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] marketed "Food Sticks" (also known as "[[Space Food Sticks]]") for the consumer market in the early 1970s.<ref name="Space Food Sticks">{{cite web |url=http://www.spacefoodsticks.com/pres.html |title=Space Food Sticks |accessdate=8 October 2014}}</ref> Fourteen individually packaged sticks were included in a box, and came in six flavors such as peanut butter, caramel, and chocolate. Food Sticks were marketed as a "nutritionally balanced between meal snack".
