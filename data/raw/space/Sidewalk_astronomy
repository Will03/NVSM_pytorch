==Overview==
Examples of people setting up telescopes on urban streets for public astronomical viewing go back well into the 19th century and maybe even further.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=L29AAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA262&dq=telescope+on+a+street&lr= The Story of the Heavens - By Robert Stawell Ball – Herschel, after 1774]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=b3ZEAAAAIAAJ&q=%22sidewalk+astronomer%22&dq=%22sidewalk+astronomer%22&lr=&pgis=1 The Historical Society of Southern California quarterly by the Historical Society of Southern California, Pioneers of Los Angeles County v. 38 – 1956 “The "sidewalk astronomer" was conspicuous in Los Angeles.

Some sidewalk "pitch men" charged the public to view astronomical objects through their telescope but other astronomers allow people to view for free.<ref name="books.google" /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CJ4sAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA298&dq=%22new+york%22+street+corner+telescope&lr= Friends' intelligencer Page 298  1862]</ref> In more recent years sidewalk astronomy has come to be more associated with [[Altruism|altruistic]] individuals or groups offering views of the nighttime sky as a free public educational service.<ref name = "Moser1">"{{Citation| last = Moser| first = Don| title = 35 Who Made a Difference: John Dobson| publisher = Smithsonian.com| date = 2005-11-01| url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/dobson.html| accessdate = 2009-06-23}}</ref>

Because the sidewalks tend to be in [[Light pollution|light-polluted]] areas, sidewalk astronomers often coordinate their activities at times when brighter celestial objects like planets, the moon, and bright stars are visible. During the day, sidewalk astronomy often includes use of a solar filter on the telescope to allow people to view the sun. Telescopes are often larger than the average available "department store telescope", sometimes very large.<ref name="books.google.com"/><ref name="Moser1"/>

==Amateur astronomical activities==

With the advent and growth of organized [[Amateur Astronomy#Societies|amateur astronomical groups]], sidewalk astronomy has come to be associated with public education about astronomy via free public viewing for anyone who wishes to look through the telescope. This usually involves individual or a groups of amateur astronomers with small-to-medium-sized telescopes. Organizations such as the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers, founded by [[John Dobson (astronomer)|John Dobson]], are organized around the idea of educating people about the universe they live in by having them look through telescopes.<ref>[http://www.sidewalkastronomers.us/id1.html Sidewalk Astronomers]</ref><ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/capecanaveral/6389/Page15.htm&date=2009-10-25+16:53:08 Los Angeles Sidewalk Astronomers - The Sidewalk Astronomers, who we are and what we do!]</ref><ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/co/DATSCOPE/whoarewe.html Liverpool Astronomical Society Sidewalk Astronomers]</ref><ref name="space1">{{citation |title=John Dobson: Amateur Astronomy's Revolutionary |page=2 |work= |publisher=[[Space.com]] |date=5 May 2000 |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/dobson_astronomer_two_000507.html |doi= |access-date=2009-06-23 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090524231108/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/dobson_astronomer_two_000507.html |archive-date=2009-05-24 |df=}}</ref> Dobson even promoted a design for large inexpensive [[reflecting telescope]] that he called a "Sidewalk Telescope", more commonly referred to as the [[Dobsonian telescope]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qnN_KRFgITQC&pg=PA17&dq=dobsonian+dobson&lr= |first=Fred |last=Watson |title=Why Is Uranus Upside Down? |publisher=Inc.
