An '''interstellar probe''' is a [[space probe]] that has left—or is expected to leave—the [[Solar System]] and enter [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]], which is typically defined as the region beyond the [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]]. It also refers to probes capable of reaching other [[star system]]s.

There are five interstellar probes: ''[[Voyager 1]]'', ''[[Voyager 2]]'', ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' and ''[[New Horizons]]''. As of 2019, ''Voyager 1'' and ''Voyager 2'' are only probes to have actually reached interstellar space.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46502820|title=Voyager 2 probe 'leaves Solar System'|last=Gill|first=Victoria|date=2018-12-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-12-10|language=en-GB}}</ref> The other three are on interstellar trajectories.

The [[termination shock]] is the point in the [[heliosphere]] where the [[solar wind]] slows down to subsonic speed. Even though the termination shock happens as close as 80–100 AU, the maximum extent of the region in which the Sun's [[gravitational field]] is dominant (the [[Hill sphere]]) is thought to be at around {{convert|230000|AU|ly|abbr=off}}.<ref name="Chebotarev1964">{{Citation|last = Chebotarev|first = G.A.|title = Gravitational Spheres of the Major Planets, Moon and Sun|journal = Soviet Astronomy|volume = 7|issue = 5|pages = 618–622|year = 1964|bibcode = 1964SvA.....7..618C}}</ref> This point is close to the nearest known star system, [[Alpha Centauri]], located 4.36 light years away. Although the probes will be under the influence of the Sun for a long time, their velocities far exceed the Sun's [[escape velocity]], so they will eventually leave forever.

Interstellar space is defined as that which lies beyond a magnetic region that extends about 122 AU from the sun, as detected by ''[[Voyager 1]],'' and the equivalent region of influence surrounding other stars.

In the early 2000s many new, relatively large planetary bodies were found beyond Pluto, and with orbits extending hundreds of AU out past the heliosheath (90–1000 AU). The NASA probe ''New Horizons'' may explore this area now that it has performed its Pluto flyby in 2015 (Pluto's orbit ranges from about 29–49&nbsp;AU).

Project Daedalus was a proposed [[nuclear pulse propulsion]] craft that used [[inertial confinement fusion]] of small pellets within a magnetic field nozzle to provide motive force. The design was studied during the 1970s by the [[British Interplanetary Society]], and was meant to flyby [[Barnard's Star]] in under a century from launch. Plans included mining Helium-3 from Jupiter and a pre-launch mass of over 50 thousand metric tonnes from orbit.

; [[Project Longshot]] (1987–1988)
Project Longshot was a proposed [[nuclear pulse propulsion]] craft that used [[inertial confinement fusion]] of small pellets within a magnetic field nozzle to provide motive force, in a manner similar to that of Project Daedalus. The design was studied during the 1990s by [[NASA]] and the [[US Naval Academy]]. The craft was designed to reach and study [[Alpha Centauri]].

==Technologies==
Some technologies that have been discussed in relation to making an interstellar probe.

===Gravity assist===
{{main|Gravity assist}}
A traditional gravity assist can be compared to throwing a tennis ball at a train (it rebounds not just with incoming velocity, but is accelerated by the train), it uses the gravity of a planet and its relative motion around the Sun compared to the spacecraft.<ref>[http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/grav/primer.php A Gravity Assist Primer]</ref> For example, Voyager 2 increased its velocity by performing gravity assists at Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.<ref>[http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/bsf4-1.php Basics of Spaceflight Section 1 Chapter 4. Interplanetary Trajectories]</ref>

===Oberth effect===
{{Main|Oberth effect}}
Herman Oberth conceived of type gravity assist in 1929.<ref>[http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/study/science/AIAA-2001-3377-169.pdf AIAA2001-3377 Solar Thermal Propulsion for an Interstellar probe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925034107/http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/study/science/AIAA-2001-3377-169.pdf |date=2015-09-25 }}</ref>

===RTGs===
{{Main|Radioisotope thermoelectric generator}}
An example of RTG used on a probe leaving the Solar system is the Voyagers. Typically these have used Plutonium but an RTG using <sup>241</sup>Am was proposed for an interstellar type mission in 2002.<ref name=ip/> This could support mission extensions up to 1000 years on the interstellar probe, because the power output would be more stable in the long-term than plutonium.<ref name=ip/> Other isotopes for RTG were also examined in the study, looking at traits such as watt/gram, half-life, and decay products.<ref name=ip/> An interstellar probe proposal from 1999 suggested using three advanced radioisotope power source.<ref name=ipjpl(a)>{{cite web|url=http://interstellar.jpl.nasa.gov/interstellar/probe/index.html |title=Interstellar Probe |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=5 February 2002 |accessdate=22 October 2010}}</ref> An RTG using <sup>241</sup>Am was also studied as RTG fuel by the [[ESA]]<ref name="ESAPP">Dr Major S. Chahal, [http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/pdf/pres/stsc2012/tech-18E.pdf], [[UK Space Agency]], 9 Feb 2012, retrieved 13 Nov 2014.</ref>
