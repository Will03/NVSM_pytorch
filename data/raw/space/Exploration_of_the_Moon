The physical '''exploration of the Moon''' began when [[Luna 2]], a [[space probe]] launched by the [[Soviet Union]], made an impact on the surface of the [[Moon]] on September 14, 1959. Prior to that the only available means of exploration had been observation from Earth. The invention of the [[optical telescope]] brought about the first leap in the quality of lunar observations. [[Galileo Galilei]] is generally credited as the first person to use a telescope for astronomical purposes; having made his own telescope in 1609, the mountains and craters on the [[lunar surface]] were among his first observations using it.

[[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]] was the first, and to date only, mission to [[Moon landing|successfully land humans on the Moon]], which it did six times. The first landing took place in 1969, when astronauts placed scientific instruments and returned [[lunar sample]]s to Earth.

{{See also|Selenography|Lunar theory}}
[[File:Micrographia Schem 38.jpg|thumb|A study of the Moon from [[Robert Hooke|Robert Hooke's]] ''[[Micrographia]]'', 1665]]
The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Anaxagoras]] (d. 428 BC) reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks, and that the latter reflected the light of the former. His non-religious view of the heavens was one cause for his imprisonment and eventual exile.<ref>{{cite web | last = O'Connor | first = J.J. |author2=Robertson, E.F. |date=February 1999 | url = http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Anaxagoras.html | title = Anaxagoras of Clazomenae | publisher = University of St Andrews | accessdate = 2007-04-12}}</ref>  In his little book ''On the Face in the Moon's Orb'', [[Plutarch]] suggested that the Moon had deep recesses in which the light of the Sun did not reach and that the spots are nothing but the shadows of rivers or deep chasms. He also entertained the possibility that the Moon was inhabited. 
[[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] went a step further and [[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|computed the distance]] from Earth, together with its size, obtaining a value of 20 times the [[Earth radius]] for the distance (the real value is 60; the Earth radius was roughly known since [[Eratosthenes]]).

Although the Chinese of the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC–202 AD) believed the Moon to be energy equated to ''[[qi]]'', their 'radiating influence' theory recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun (mentioned by Anaxagoras above).<ref name=Needham>{{cite book | last=Needham | first=Joseph | year=1986 | series=Science and Civilization in China | volume=3 | title=Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and Earth | place=Taipei | publisher=Caves Books | page=227; 411–416 | isbn=978-0-521-05801-8}}</ref> This was supported by mainstream thinkers such as [[Jing Fang]],<ref name=Needham/> who noted the sphericity of the Moon.<ref name=Needham/> [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the Moon to a round ball of reflective silver that, when doused with white powder and viewed from the side, would appear to be a crescent.<ref name=Needham/>

By 499 AD, the Indian astronomer [[Aryabhata]] mentioned in his ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' that reflected sunlight is the cause behind the shining of the Moon.<ref name=Hayashi08Aryabhata>Hayashi (2008), ''Aryabhata I''</ref>

By the [[Middle Ages]], before the invention of the telescope, an increasing number of people began to recognise the Moon as a sphere, though many believed that it was "perfectly smooth".<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Helden |first=A. |year=1995 |url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/moon.html |title=The Moon |publisher=Galileo Project |accessdate=2007-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040623085326/http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/Moon.html |archivedate=2004-06-23 |df= }}</ref> In 1609, [[Galileo Galilei]] drew one of the first telescopic drawings of the Moon in his book {{lang|la|[[Sidereus Nuncius]]}} and noted that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters. Later in the 17th century, [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] and [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]] drew a map of the Moon and gave many craters the names they still have today. On maps, the dark parts of the Moon's surface were called ''maria'' (singular ''mare'') or seas, and the light parts were called ''terrae'' or continents.

[[Thomas Harriot]], as well as Galilei, drew the first telescopic representation of the Moon and observed it for several years. His drawings, however, remained unpublished.<ref name="MOO">{{cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/Moon.html |title=The Galileo Project|accessdate=2007-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905185030/http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/moon.html |archivedate=September 5, 2007 }}</ref> The first map of the Moon was made by the Belgian cosmographer and astronomer [[Michael Florent van Langren]] in 1645.<ref name="MOO"/> Two years later a much more influential effort was published by [[Johannes Hevelius]].

Hevelius's nomenclature, although used in [[Protestant]] countries until the eighteenth century, was replaced by the system published in 1651 by the [[Jesuit]] astronomer [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], who gave the large naked-eye spots the names of seas and the telescopic spots (now called craters) the name of philosophers and astronomers.<ref name="MOO"/> In 1753 the Croatian Jesuit and astronomer [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]] discovered the absence of atmosphere on the Moon. In 1824 [[Franz von Gruithuisen]] explained the formation of craters as a result of [[meteorite]] strikes.<ref>{{cite book | title =Энциклопедия для детей (астрономия)| publisher =Аванта+ | year = 1998| location = Москва| isbn = 978-5-89501-016-7}}</ref>

The possibility that the Moon contains vegetation and is inhabited by selenites was seriously considered by major astronomers even into the first decades of the 19th century.  In 1834–1836, [[Wilhelm Beer]] and [[Johann Heinrich Mädler]] published their four-volume {{lang|la|Mappa Selenographica}} and the book {{lang|de|Der Mond}} in 1837, which firmly established the conclusion that the Moon has no bodies of water nor any appreciable atmosphere.

==Space race==
{{Main|Space Race|Moon landing}}
{{See also|Soviet manned lunar programs}}

The [[Cold War]]-inspired "[[space race]]" and "[[Moon race]]" between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States|United States of America]] accelerated with a focus on the Moon. This included many scientifically important firsts, such as the first photographs of the then-unseen [[far side of the Moon]] in 1959 by the Soviet Union, and culminated with the landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969, widely seen around the world as one of the pivotal events of the 20th century, and indeed of human history in general.

[[File:Luna 3 moon.jpg|left|thumb|The first image returned of another world from space, photographed by [[Luna 3]], showed the Moon's far side.]]
[[File:Laika ac Memorial Museum of Astronautics (6995740711).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Luna 9]] was the first spacecraft to achieve a landing on the Moon.]]

The first man-made object to reach the Moon was the unmanned Soviet probe [[Luna 2]], which made a hard landing on September 14, 1959, at 21:02:24 Z. The far side of the Moon was first photographed on October 7, 1959, by the Soviet probe [[Luna 3]]. Though vague by today's standards, the photos showed that the far side of the Moon almost completely lacked [[Lunar mare|maria]]. In an effort to compete with these Soviet successes, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] proposed the national goal of landing a human on the Moon. Speaking to a Joint Session of Congress on May 25, 1961, he said <blockquote>"First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space."<ref>[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/Urgent+National+Needs+Page+4.htm Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs Page 4 - John F.

[[Luna 9]] was the first probe to soft land on the Moon and transmit pictures from the lunar surface on February 3, 1966. It was proven that a lunar lander would not sink into a thick layer of dust, as had been feared. The first artificial satellite of the Moon was the Soviet probe [[Luna 10]], launched March 31, 1966.

On December 24, 1968, the crew of [[Apollo 8]], [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] and [[William Anders]], became the first human beings to enter lunar orbit and see the far side of the Moon in person. Humans first landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. The first human to walk on the lunar surface was [[Neil Armstrong]], commander of the U.S. mission [[Apollo 11]]. The first robot [[lunar rover]] to land on the Moon was the Soviet vessel [[Lunokhod 1]] on November 17, 1970, as part of the [[Lunokhod programme]]. To date, the last human to stand on the Moon was [[Eugene Cernan]], who as part of the [[Apollo 17]] mission, walked on the Moon in December 1972. ''See also:'' [[List of lunar astronauts|A full list of lunar Apollo astronauts]].

[[Moon rock|Moon rock samples]] were brought back to Earth by three Luna missions ([[Luna 16]], [[Luna 20|20]], and [[Luna 24|24]]) and the Apollo missions 11 through 17 (except [[Apollo 13]], which aborted its planned lunar landing).

From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s there were 65 Moon landings (with 10 in 1971 alone), but after [[Luna 24]] in 1976 they suddenly stopped. The Soviet Union started focusing on [[Venus]] and [[space station]]s and the U.S. on [[Mars]] and beyond, and on the [[Skylab]] and [[Space Shuttle]] programs.

Before the Moon race the US had pre-projects for scientific and military moonbases: the [[Lunex Project]] and [[Project Horizon]]. Besides manned landings, the abandoned [[Soviet manned lunar programs]] included the building of a multipurpose moonbase "[[Zvezda (moonbase)|Zvezda]]", the first detailed project, complete with developed mockups of expedition vehicles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://astronautix.com/craft/lekmplex.htm|title=LEK Lunar Expeditionary Complex|work=astronautix.com|accessdate=12 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208200041/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lekmplex.htm|archivedate=8 December 2013|df=}}</ref> and surface modules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://astronautix.com/craft/dlbodule.htm|title=DLB Module|work=astronautix.com|accessdate=12 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107164731/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/dlbodule.htm|archivedate=7 January 2014|df=}}</ref>

In 1990 Japan visited the Moon with the ''[[Hiten]]'' spacecraft, becoming the third country to place an object in orbit around the Moon. The spacecraft released the [[Hiten|Hagoromo]] probe into lunar orbit, but the transmitter failed, thereby preventing further scientific use of the spacecraft.  In September 2007, Japan launched the ''[[SELENE]]'' spacecraft, with the objectives "to obtain scientific data of the lunar origin and evolution and to develop the technology for the future lunar exploration", according to the JAXA official website.<ref name="index">{{cite web |url=http://www.selene.jaxa.jp/index_e.htm |title=Kaguya (SELENE)  |accessdate=2007-06-25 |publisher=JAXA}}</ref>

SMART 1's primary goal was to take three-dimensional [[X-ray]] and [[thermography|infrared imagery]] of the lunar surface. SMART 1 entered lunar [[orbit]] on November 15, 2004 and continued to make observations until September 3, 2006, when it was intentionally crashed into the lunar surface in order to study the impact plume.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMBY5BVLRE_index_0.html| title=SMART-1 Impacts Moon|date=4 September 2006| publisher=ESA| accessdate=2006-09-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061025000823/http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMBY5BVLRE_index_0.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-25}}</ref>
