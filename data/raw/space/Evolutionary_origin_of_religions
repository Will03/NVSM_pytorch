The '''evolutionary origin of religions''' and [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|religious behavior]] is a field of study related to [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|evolutionary psychology]], the [[origin of language]] and [[mythology]], and cross-cultural comparison of the [[anthropology of religion]].  Some subjects of interest include [[Neolithic religion]], evidence for spirituality or cultic behavior in the [[Paleolithic religion|Upper Paleolithic]], and similarities in [[Chimpanzee spirituality|great ape behavior]].

== Relevant prerequisites for human religion ==

===Increased brain size===
In this set of theories, the religious mind is one consequence of a brain that is large enough to formulate religious and philosophical ideas.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Religious ideas can theoretically be traced to the evolution of brains large enough to make possible the kind of abstract thought necessary to formulate religious and philosophical ideas|authorlink=Paul R.

Much of the brain's expansion took place in the [[neocortex]]. The cerebral neocortex is presumed to be responsible for the neuronal computations underlying complex phenomena such as perception, thought, language, attention, episodic memory and voluntary movement.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/141/1/11|title=How unique is the human neocortex?|first1=Zoltán|last1=Molnár|first2=Alex|last2=Pollen|date=1 January 2014|journal=Development|volume=141|issue=1|pages=11–16|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=dev.biologists.org|doi=10.1242/dev.101279|pmid=24346696}}</ref> According to [[Dunbar's number|Dunbar's theory]], the relative [[Neocortex#Neocortex ratio|neocortex size]] of any species correlates with the level of social complexity of the particular species.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Processing power limits social group size: computational evidence for the cognitive costs of sociality|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20131151|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2013-08-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 3712454|pmid = 23804623|page = 20131151|volume = 280|issue = 1765|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2013.1151|first = T.|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = R.

[[Robin Dunbar]] argues that the critical event in the evolution of the neocortex took place at the [[speciation]] of [[Archaic humans|archaic homo sapiens]] about 500,000 years ago. His study indicates that only after the speciation event is the neocortex large enough to process complex social phenomena such as language and religion. The study is based on a [[regression analysis]] of neocortex size plotted against a number of social behaviors of living and extinct hominids.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/ANTH689%20Fall%202005/Week%2011/Dunbar%202003.pdf |title=THE SOCIAL BRAIN: Mind, Language, and Society in Evolutionary Perspective |last=Dunbar |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Dunbar |year=2003 |format=&ndash; <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=author%3ADunbar+intitle%3ATHE+SOCIAL+BRAIN%3A+Mind%2C+Language%2C+and+Society+in+Evolutionary+Perspective&as_publication=&as_ylo=2003&as_yhi=2003&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911214723/http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/ANTH689%20Fall%202005/Week%2011/Dunbar%202003.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2008 }}</ref>

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggests that religion may have grown out of evolutionary changes which favored larger brains as a means of cementing group coherence among savannah hunters, after that larger brain enabled reflection on the inevitability of personal mortality.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Stephen Jay Gould|author2=Paul McGarr|author3=Steven Peter Russell Rose|title=The richness of life: the essential Stephen Jay Gould|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC|year=2007|publisher=W.

===Tool use===
[[Lewis Wolpert]] argues that causal beliefs that emerged from tool use played a major role in the evolution of belief. The manufacture of complex tools requires creating a mental image of an object which does not exist naturally before actually making the artifact. Furthermore, one must understand how the tool would be used, that requires an understanding of [[causality]].<ref name="wolpert">{{cite book| title=Six impossible things before breakfast, The evolutionary origins of belief|authorlink=Lewis Wolpert|isbn=978-0-393-06449-0|quote=with regard to hafted tools, One would have to understand that the two pieces serve different purposes, and imagine how the tool could be used,| author=Lewis Wolpert| year=2006| publisher=Norton| location=New York }}</ref> Accordingly, the level of sophistication of stone tools is a useful indicator of causal beliefs.<ref name="wolpert2">{{cite book| title=Six impossible things before breakfast, The evolutionary origins of belief|authorlink=Lewis Wolpert|last=Wolpert|first=Lewis|isbn=978-0-393-06449-0| quote= Belief in cause and effect has had the most enormous effect on human evolution, both physical and cultural.

However, recent studies of other primates indicate that causality may not be a uniquely human trait. For example, chimpanzees have been known to escape from pens closed with multiple latches, which was previously thought could only have been figured out by humans who understood causality.  Chimpanzees are also known to mourn the dead, and notice things that have only aesthetic value, like sunsets, both of which may be considered to be components of religion or spirituality.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/can-an-ape-learn-to-be-human-2332047.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Steve | last=Connor | title=Can an ape learn to be human? | date=August 5, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}</ref>
The difference between the comprehension of causality by humans and chimpanzees is one of degree. The degree of comprehension in an animal depends upon the size of the prefrontal cortex: the greater the size of the prefrontal cortex the deeper the comprehension.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc=3190564 | pmid=22013351 | doi=10.4103/0973-1229.33001 | volume=6 | issue=1 | title=Neurobiology of spirituality | year=2008 | journal=Mens Sana Monogr | pages=63–80 | last1 = Mohandas | first1 = E}} {{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}</ref>

===Development of language===
{{See also|Origin of language|Myth and religion}}
Religion requires a system of symbolic communication, such as language, to be transmitted from one individual to another. [[Philip Lieberman]] states "human religious thought and moral sense clearly rest on a cognitive-linguistic base".<ref name="lieberman"/> From this premise science writer [[Nicholas Wade]] states: 
:"Like most behaviors that are found in societies throughout the world, religion must have been present in the ancestral human population before the dispersal from Africa 50,000 years ago. Although religious rituals usually involve dance and music, they are also very verbal, since the sacred truths have to be stated. If so, religion, at least in its modern form, cannot pre-date the emergence of language. It has been argued earlier that language attained its modern state shortly before the exodus from Africa. If religion had to await the evolution of modern, articulate language, then it too would have emerged shortly before 50,000 years ago."<ref name="wade">*"[[Nicholas Wade|Wade, Nicholas]] – ''Before The Dawn, Discovering the lost history of our ancestors''.  Penguin Books, London, 2006.  p. 8 p. 165" {{ISBN|1-59420-079-3}}</ref>
Another view distinguishes individual religious belief from collective religious belief. While the former does not require prior development of language, the latter does. The individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it. This activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it. The theory is, belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses arbitrarily assumed by individuals to explain natural phenomena that cannot be explained otherwise. The resulting need to share individual hypotheses with others leads eventually to collective religious belief. A socially accepted hypothesis becomes dogmatic backed by social sanction.

===Morality and group living===
{{Main|Evolution of morality|Morality#Evolution}}
[[Frans de Waal]] and Barbara King both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality. Although morality awareness may be a unique human trait, many [[social animal]]s, such as primates, dolphins and whales, have been known to exhibit pre-moral sentiments. According to [[Michael Shermer]], the following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals, particularly the great apes:
{{quote|attachment and bonding, cooperation and mutual aid, sympathy and empathy, direct and indirect reciprocity, altruism and reciprocal altruism, conflict resolution and peacemaking, deception and deception detection, community concern and caring about what others think about you, and awareness of and response to the social rules of the group.<ref name="shermer">{{cite book

De Waal contends that all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile. Pre-moral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, a lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders. Being part of a group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that [[pack hunter|hunt in packs]] to take down large or dangerous prey.

All social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place. Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. However, higher order primates also have a sense of fairness. In a 2008 study, de Waal and colleagues put two capuchin monkeys side by side and gave them a simple task to complete: Giving a rock to the experimenter. They were given cucumbers as a reward for executing the task, and the monkeys obliged. But if one of the monkeys was given grapes, something interesting happened:
After receiving the first piece of cucumber, the capuchin monkey gave the experimenter a rock as expected. But upon seeing that the other monkey got grapes, the capuchin monkey threw away the next piece of cucumber that was given to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/19/health/chimpanzee-fairness-morality/index.html|title=Morality: It's not just for humans - CNN|first=By Elizabeth Landau,|last=CNN|date=|website=cnn.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>
 
Chimpanzees live in [[Fission-fusion society|fission-fusion groups]] that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size. Based on the size of [[wikt:extant|extant]] hunter-gatherer societies, recent Paleolithic [[hominid]]s lived in bands of a few hundred individuals. As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of social control, conflict resolution and group solidarity. According to Dr. de Waal, human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies. Humans enforce their society's moral codes much more rigorously with rewards, punishments and reputation building. Humans also apply a degree of judgment and reason not otherwise seen in the animal kingdom.

Psychologist Matt J. Rossano argues that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include [[supernatural]] agents. By including ever-watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.<ref name="supernature">

Rossano is referring here to collective religious belief and the social sanction that institutionalized morality. According to Rossano's teaching, individual religious belief is thus initially epistemological, not ethical, in nature.

==Evolutionary psychology of religion==
{{Main|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Cognitive scientists underlined that religions may be explained as a result of the brain architecture that expressed in early [[Homo#list of species|''Homo'' genus]], through the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|history of life]]. However, there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind. The two main schools of thought hold that either religion evolved due to [[natural selection]] and has selective advantage, or that religion is an evolutionary byproduct of other mental adaptations.<ref>[http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BeginnersGuide.pdf Evolutionary Religious Studies (ERS): A Beginner's Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611204211/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BeginnersGuide.pdf |date=2010-06-11 }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}</ref> [[Stephen Jay Gould]], for example, believed that religion was an [[exaptation]] or a [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]], in other words that religion evolved as byproduct of psychological mechanisms that evolved for other reasons.<ref name="henig">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html|title=Darwin's God|date=4 March 2007|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>[http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/religion%20seminar%20papers/Kirkpatrick_1999.pdf Toward an evolutionary psychology of religion and personality] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910084648/http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/religion%20seminar%20papers/Kirkpatrick_1999.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}</ref><ref name="pinker">{{cite web|url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm|title=The evolutionary psychology of religion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063432/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm |archive-date=2008-05-09 |author=[[Steven Pinker]]|date=29 October 2004|website=harvard.edu|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>

Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm (agent detection), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events ([[etiology]]), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions ([[theory of mind]]). These three adaptations (among others) allow human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise, e.g. thunder, lightning, movement of planets, complexity of life.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid= 16035401|url= http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|title= Religion's evolutionary landscape: counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion.|year= 2004|journal= [[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]|last1= Atran|first1= S|last2= Norenzayan|first2= A|volume= 27|issue= 6|pages= 713–30; discussion 730–70|doi= 10.1017/s0140525x04000172|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807165354/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|archivedate= 2008-08-07|df= |citeseerx= 10.1.1.687.8586}}</ref> The emergence of collective religious belief identified the agents as deities that standardized the explanation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The deification of historical figures and the emergence of priesthoods as a solution to a network coordination problem|journal = Religion, Brain & Behavior|date = 2015-08-14|issn = 2153-599X|pages = 1–11|volume = 0|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|first = Tamás|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = James|last2 = Carney}}</ref>

Some scholars have suggested that religion is genetically "hardwired" into the human condition. One controversial proposal, the [[God gene]] hypothesis, states that some variants of a specific gene, the [[Vesicular monoamine transporter 2|VMAT2]] gene, predispose to spirituality.<ref name="kluger2004">{{cite news

Another view is based on the concept of the [[triune brain]]: the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and the neocortex, proposed by [[Paul D. MacLean]]. Collective religious belief draws upon the emotions of love, fear, and gregariousness and is deeply embedded in the limbic system through socio-biological conditioning and social sanction. Individual religious belief utilizes reason based in the neocortex and often varies from collective religion. The limbic system is much older in evolutionary terms than the neocortex and is, therefore, stronger than it much in the same way as the reptilian is stronger than both the limbic system and the neocortex.

Yet another view is that the behavior of people who participate in a religion makes them feel better and this improves their fitness, so that there is a genetic selection in favor of people who are willing to believe in religion.  Specifically, rituals, beliefs, and the social contact typical of religious groups may serve to calm the mind (for example by reducing ambiguity and the uncertainty due to complexity) and allow it to function better when under stress.<ref>{{cite book | author = Lionel Tiger and Michael McGuire | title = God's Brain | publisher = Prometheus Books | date = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-61614-164-6}} see pages 202-204</ref> This would allow religion to be used as a powerful survival mechanism, particularly in facilitating the evolution of [[War#Motivations|hierarchies]] of [[Killer ape theory|warriors]], which if true, may be why many modern religions tend to promote [[fertility]] and [[family|kinship]].

Still another view, proposed by F.H. Previc, is that human religion was a product of an increase in dopaminergic functions in the human brain and a general intellectual expansion beginning around 80 kya.<ref>Previc, F.H. (2009).

==Prehistoric evidence of religion==

The exact time when humans first became [[religion|religious]] remains unknown, however research in evolutionary archaeology shows credible evidence of religious-cum-ritualistic behaviour from around the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era (45-200 [[tya (unit)|thousand years ago]]).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5954/784|title=On the Origin of Religion|first=Elizabeth|last=Culotta|date=6 November 2009|journal=Science|volume=326|issue=5954|pages=784–787|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=science.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.326_784|pmid=19892955}}</ref>

===Paleolithic burials===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Skhul burial.jpg|thumb|right|400px|90,000 year old double burial of Homo sapiens at [[Qafzeh]] cave in Israel]] -->
The earliest evidence of religious thought is based on the ritual treatment of the dead. Most animals display only a casual interest in the dead of their own species.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8209 Elephants may pay homage to the dead]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}</ref> Ritual burial thus represents a significant change in human behavior. Ritual burials represent an awareness of life and death and a possible belief in the [[afterlife]]. [[Philip Lieberman]] states "burials with grave goods clearly signify religious practices and concern for the dead that transcends daily life."<ref name="lieberman">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&pg=PA162 | title=Uniquely Human|isbn=978-0-674-92183-2| year=1991|last=Lieberman| authorlink=Philip Lieberman |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, Mass.}}</ref>

The earliest evidence for treatment of the dead comes from [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]] in Spain. At this location the bones of 30 individuals believed to be ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' have been found in a pit.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Q3nOqkJQwoC&pg=PA158 |title=How Symbols, Language, and Intelligence Evolved from Early Primates to Modern Human|authorlink=Stanley Greenspan|last=Greenspan|first=Stanley|isbn=978-0-306-81449-5|year=2006|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}</ref>
[[Neanderthals]] are also contenders for the first [[Hominidae|hominids]] to intentionally bury the dead. They may have placed corpses into shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones. The presence of these [[grave goods]] may indicate an emotional connection with the deceased and possibly a belief in the afterlife. Neanderthal burial sites include [[Shanidar]] in Iraq and [[Krapina]] in Croatia and [[Kebara Cave]] in Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.waspress.co.uk/journals/beforefarming/journal_20021/abstracts/papers/20021_04_s.pdf|title= The Neanderthal dead:exploring mortuary variability in Middle Palaeolithic Eurasia|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910084648/http://www.waspress.co.uk/journals/beforefarming/journal_20021/abstracts/papers/20021_04_s.pdf|archivedate= 2008-09-10|df= }}{{clarify|date=September 2015}}</ref><ref name="evolving_graves"/><ref name="evolving_graves">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_24_160/ai_81827792/pg_1|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|author=|date=|website=findarticles.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=BBC article on the Neanderthals|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A21606040|quote=Neanderthals buried their dead, and one burial at [[Shanidar]] in Iraq was accompanied by grave goods in the form of plants. All of the plants are used in recent times for medicinal purposes, and it seems likely that the Neanderthals also used them in this way and buried them with their dead for the same reason. Grave goods are an archaeological marker of belief in an afterlife, so Neanderthals may well have had some form of religious belief.}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}</ref>

The earliest known burial of modern humans is from a cave in Israel located at [[Qafzeh]]. Human remains have been dated to 100,000 years ago. Human skeletons were found stained with [[red ochre]]. A variety of grave goods were found at the burial site. The mandible of a wild boar was found placed in the arms of one of the skeletons.<ref name="lieberman2">. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&pg=PA163 Uniquely Human page 163]</ref> Philip Lieberman states:
:"Burial rituals incorporating grave goods may have been invented by the anatomically modern hominids who emigrated from Africa to the Middle East roughly 100,000 years ago".<ref name="lieberman2"/>

Matt Rossano suggests that the period between 80,000–60,000 years before present, following the retreat of humans from the Levant to Africa, was a crucial period in the evolution of religion.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/recentpubs/Springer%20chapter.pdf|title=The African Interregnum: The "Where," "When," and "Why" of the Evolution of Religion|year=2009|last=Rossano|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-00128-4_9|first1=Matt|pages=127–141|series=The Frontiers Collection|isbn=978-3-642-00127-7}}</ref>

===Use of symbolism===
The use of [[Religious symbolism|symbolism in religion]] is a universal established phenomenon. Archeologist [[Steven Mithen]] contends that it is common for religious practices to involve the creation of images and symbols to represent supernatural beings and ideas. Because supernatural beings violate the principles of the natural world, there will always be difficulty in communicating and sharing supernatural concepts with others. This problem can be overcome by anchoring these supernatural beings in material form through representational art. When translated into material form, supernatural concepts become easier to communicate and understand.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BRyMgrYx3EUC&pg=PA147 Symbolism and the Supernatural]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}</ref> Due to the association of art and religion, evidence of symbolism in the fossil record is indicative of a mind capable of religious thoughts. Art and symbolism demonstrates a capacity for abstract thought and imagination necessary to construct religious ideas. Wentzel van Huyssteen states that the translation of the non-visible through symbolism enabled early human ancestors to hold beliefs in abstract terms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Human Uniqueness and Symbolization|url=http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10167/Default.aspx|quote=This 'coding of the non-visible' through abstract, symbolic thought, enabled also our early human ancestors to argue and hold beliefs in abstract terms. In fact, the concept of God itself follows from the ability to abstract and conceive of 'person'|access-date=2008-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527011227/http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10167/Default.aspx|archive-date=2009-05-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>

Some of the earliest evidence of symbolic behavior is associated with [[Middle Stone Age]] sites in Africa. From at least 100,000 years ago, there is evidence of the use of pigments such as [[red ochre]]. Pigments are of little practical use to hunter gatherers, thus evidence of their use is interpreted as symbolic or for ritual purposes. Among extant hunter gatherer populations around the world, red ochre is still used extensively for ritual purposes. It has been argued that it is universal among human cultures for the color red to represent blood, sex, life and death.<ref name="rossano">

The use of red ochre as a proxy for symbolism is often criticized as being too indirect. Some scientists, such as [[Richard Klein (paleoanthropologist)|Richard Klein]] and [[Steven Mithen]], only recognize unambiguous forms of art as representative of abstract ideas. Upper paleolithic cave art provides some of the most unambiguous evidence of religious thought from the paleolithic. Cave paintings at [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] depict creatures that are half human and half animal.

Organised religion traces its roots to the [[neolithic revolution]] that began 11,000 years ago in the [[Near East]] but may have occurred independently in several other locations around the world. The invention of agriculture transformed many human societies from a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to a [[sedentism|sedentary lifestyle]]. The consequences of the neolithic revolution included a population explosion and an acceleration in the pace of technological development. The transition from foraging bands to states and empires precipitated more specialized and developed forms of religion that reflected the new social and political environment. While bands and small tribes possess supernatural beliefs, these beliefs do not serve to justify a central authority, justify transfer of wealth or maintain peace between unrelated individuals.
Organized religion emerged as a means of providing social and economic stability through the following ways:
*Justifying the central authority, which in turn possessed the right to collect taxes in return for providing social and security services.
*Bands and tribes consist of small number of related individuals. However, states and nations are composed of many thousands of unrelated individuals. [[Jared Diamond]] argues that organized religion served to provide a bond between unrelated individuals who would otherwise be more prone to enmity. In his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' he argues that the leading cause of death among hunter-gatherer societies is murder.<ref name="diamond">

The states born out of the Neolithic revolution, such as those of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, were [[theocracies]] with chiefs, kings and emperors playing dual roles of political and spiritual leaders.<ref name="shermer"/> Anthropologists have found that virtually all state societies and chiefdoms from around the world have been found to justify political power through divine authority. This suggests that political authority co-opts collective religious belief to bolster itself.<ref name="shermer"/>

===Invention of writing===
{{See also|History of writing}}
Following the neolithic revolution, the pace of technological development (cultural evolution) intensified due to the invention of writing 5000 years ago. Symbols that became words later on made effective communication of ideas possible. Printing invented only over a thousand years ago increased the speed of communication exponentially and became the main spring of cultural evolution.
Writing is thought to have been first invented in either Sumeria or Ancient Egypt and was initially used for accounting. Soon after, writing was used to record myth. The first religious texts mark the beginning of [[History of religion|religious history]]. The [[Pyramid Texts]] from ancient Egypt are one of the oldest known religious texts in the world, dating to between 2400–2300 BCE.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=SieAmOiyGQMC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9 | title=An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Literature|first= Wallis|last= Budge|authorlink = E.

In pre-literate societies, religious ideas were based on an [[oral tradition]], the contents of which were articulated by shamans and remained limited to the collective memories of the society's inhabitants. With the advent of writing, information that was not easy to remember could easily be stored in sacred texts that were maintained by a select group (clergy). Humans could store and process large amounts of information with writing that otherwise would have been forgotten. Writing therefore enabled religions to develop coherent and comprehensive doctrinal systems that remained independent of time and place.<ref>{{cite book|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnnnAwMfeV0C&pg=PA160#PPA160,M1|chapter=Holy Book:The Invention of writing and religious cognition|title=Magic, Miracles, and Religion: A Scientist's Perspective | first=Ilkka|last=Pyysiäinen|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7591-0663-5|publisher=AltMira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA}}</ref>
Writing also brought a measure of objectivity to human knowledge. Formulation of thoughts in words and the requirement for validation made mutual exchange of ideas and the sifting of generally acceptable from not acceptable ideas possible. The generally acceptable ideas became objective knowledge reflecting the continuously evolving framework of human awareness of reality that [[Karl Popper]] calls 'verisimilitude' – a stage on the human journey to truth.<ref>''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', 1972, Rev. ed., 1979, {{ISBN|0-19-875024-2}}</ref>
