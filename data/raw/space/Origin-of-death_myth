The '''origin of death''' is a theme in the [[myth]]s of many cultures. Death is a universal feature of human life, so stories about its origin appear to be universal in human cultures.<ref name=Green>{{cite book | last = Green | first = James | title = Beyond the Good Death | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | location = Philadelphia | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-8122-4042-1 |pages=22–23}}</ref> As such it is a form of [[cosmological myth]] (a type of myth that explains the origins of a culture and the problems that faces it).<ref>{{cite book | last = Doniger | first = Wendy (ed) | authorlink=Wendy Doniger| title = Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions | publisher = Merriam-Webster | location = Springfield | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-87779-044-2 |page=264}}</ref> No one type of these myths is universal, but each region has its own characteristic types.<ref name=Dundes>{{cite book | last = Dundes | first = Alan | authorlink=Alan Dundes| title = Sacred Narrative, Readings in the Theory of Myth | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-520-05192-0 |page=73}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Patton | first = Laurie | title = Myth and Method | publisher = University Press of Virginia | location = Charlottesville | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-8139-1657-7 |pages=149–150}}</ref> Such myths have therefore been a frequent topic of study in the field of [[comparative mythology]].<ref>See for example, {{cite book | last = Littleton | first = C.

==Africa==
{{see also|African traditional religion}}
Pervasively in the myths of African cultures, in the beginning there was no death. This can be because a supreme being makes people young again when they grow old; people die but go to heaven to live. In some stories eternal life is lost through some flaw (such as greed, curiosity, stubbornness or arrogance), or as a punishment for disobedience, or as the result of human indifference. Other themes are the failure of a message to be delivered to humans, or a severing of the link between heaven and Earth. Sometimes it is as a result of an accident.<ref>{{cite book | last = Roberts | first = Jeremy | title = African Mythology a to Z | publisher = Chelsea House Publications | location = City | year = 2010 | isbn = 1-60413-415-1 |pages=33–34}}</ref>

The origin of death is a common theme in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] mythology.<ref name=Clark>{{cite book | last = Clark | first = Ella | title = Indian Legends from the Northern Rockies | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | location = Norman | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-8061-2087-8 |pages=75–77}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = Stith |authorlink=Stith Thompson| title = The Folktale | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1977 | isbn = 0-520-03537-2 }}</ref> The myths of the [[plateau tribes]] blame its origin on the interference of the [[trickster#Coyote|trickster figure Coyote]].<ref name=Clark/> The [[Chiricahua Apache]] myth also blames Coyote.<ref>{{cite book | last = Opler | first = Morris | title = Myths and Tales of the Chiricahua Apache Indians | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | location = Lincoln | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-8032-8602-3 |page=28}}</ref> The [[plains tribes]] ascribe it to the result of unfavorable chance. For example, in the [[Blackfeet]] account, Old Man and Old Woman arguing over whether people should die, with Old Woman using magic to ensure that the [[sign]] that they agreed upon gave her desired result.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Alexander | first1 = Hartley Burr | title = North American Mythology | publisher = Kessinger Publishing, LLC | date = 10 March 2003 | pages = 115–120| isbn = 0-7661-3342-7}}</ref>

Among the native peoples of the [[Western United States]], a common explanation of death was that it was the result of a debate between two people or animals in which one would favour death and the other immortality.  For example, the story of the [[Thompson River Salish people|Thompson Indians]] was that [[Raven in mythology#North American|Raven]] wanted death as there would otherwise be too many men.  [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] preferred sleep to death but was outvoted by Crow, Fly and Maggot, who sided with Raven.  Raven's daughter was then the first to die and so Raven wanted to reverse his choice.  But Coyote, the trickster, said that the decision was now irrevocable.<ref>{{citation |title=The Origin of Death |author=Franz Boas |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=30 |number=118 |year=1917 |pages=486–491 |publisher=American Folklore Society |jstor=534498}}</ref>

==Oceania==
In [[Oceania]], the most common myth is that originally people had the power to rejuvenate themselves by shedding their skin like a snake. However, when somebody, usually an old woman, does this, she frightens her grandchildren, who cry until she resumes her old skin, an act which mandates death for future generations.<ref name=Dundes/>

===Polynesia===
In [[Polynesian mythology]], death is the result of the hero [[Māui (mythology)|Māui]] being swallowed up by [[Hades]] or Night. If he had escaped, mankind would be immortal, however one of the birds that accompanied him burst out laughing, awakening [[Hine-nui-te-po]] who crushed Māui to death, ending hopes of immortality with him.<ref>Lang(2007) p119</ref>

===Greek mythology===
[[File:Pandora.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Pandora]] by [[Jules Joseph Lefebvre|Lefebvre]] ]]
In an early [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]], death is a consequence of the disagreement between [[Zeus]] and [[Prometheus]]. As a result of this quarrel, Zeus creates woman, in the form of [[Pandora]] and presents her to Prometheus' brother [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]], with death being one of the results of his opening of [[Pandora's box]], which she brought with her.<ref>Lang(2007) p116</ref>
