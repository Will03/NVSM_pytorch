The '''Mariner program''' was a 10-mission program conducted by the American space agency [[NASA]] in conjunction with [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL).<ref name=M2_final /> The program launched a series of [[Robotic spacecraft|robotic]] [[Space probe|interplanetary probes]], from 1962 to 1973, designed to investigate [[Mars]], [[Venus]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].<ref name=M_program /> The program included a number of firsts, including the first [[planetary flyby]], the first planetary [[orbiter]], and the first [[gravity assist]] maneuver.

Of the ten vehicles in the Mariner series, seven were successful, forming the starting point for many subsequent NASA/JPL space probe programs. The planned Mariner Jupiter-Saturn vehicles were adapted into the [[Voyager program]],<ref name=butrica /> while the [[Viking program]] orbiters were enlarged versions of the [[Mariner 9]] spacecraft.  Later Mariner-based spacecraft include the [[Magellan spacecraft|Magellan]] probe and the [[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]] probe, while the second-generation [[Mariner Mark II]] series evolved into the [[Cassini–Huygens]] probe.

The total cost of the Mariner program was approximately $554 million.<ref>[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1964-077A Mariner 4, NSSDC Master Catalog]</ref>

The name of the Mariner program was decided in "May 1960-at the suggestion of Edgar M. Cortright" to have the "planetary mission probes ... patterned after nautical terms, to convey "the impression of travel to great distances and remote lands."" That "decision was the basis for naming Mariner, Ranger, Surveyor, and Viking probes."<ref>[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4402/ch3.htm SP-4402 Origins of NASA Names]</ref>

All Mariner spacecraft were based on a hexagonal or octagonal "[[bus]]", which housed all of the electronics, and to which all components were attached, such as antennae, cameras, propulsion, and power sources.<ref name=M_program /><ref name=M2 />  [[Mariner 2]] was based on the [[Ranger program|Ranger]] Lunar probe. All of the Mariners launched after Mariner 2 had four solar panels for power, except for [[Mariner 10]], which had two.  Additionally, all except [[Mariner 1]], Mariner 2 and [[Mariner 5]] had TV cameras.

The first five Mariners were launched on [[Atlas-Agena]] [[rocket]]s, while the last five used the [[Atlas-Centaur]].  All Mariner-based probes after [[Mariner 10]] used the [[Titan III|Titan IIIE]], [[Titan IV]] unmanned rockets or the [[Space Shuttle]] with a solid-fueled [[Inertial Upper Stage]] and multiple planetary flybys.

==Mariners 1 and 2==
{{Main|Mariner 1|Mariner 2}}
[[Image:Mariner 2.jpg|150px|right]]

[[Mariner 1]] (P-37) and [[Mariner 2]] (P-38) were two deep-space probes making up NASA's Mariner-R project. The primary goal of the project was to develop and launch two spacecraft sequentially to the near vicinity of Venus, receive communications from the spacecraft and to perform radiometric temperature measurements of the planet. A secondary objective was to make [[interplanetary magnetic field]] and/or particle measurements on the way to, and in the vicinity of, Venus.<ref name=MR_tracking /><ref name=MR_craft />  Mariner 1 (designated Mariner R-1) was launched on July 22, 1962, but was destroyed approximately 5 minutes after liftoff by the Air Force [[Range safety#Range Safety Officer|Range Safety Officer]] when its malfunctioning [[Atlas-Agena]] rocket went off course. Mariner 2 (designated Mariner R-2) was launched on August 27, 1962, sending it on a 3½-month flight to Venus. The mission was a success, and Mariner 2 became the first spacecraft to have flown by another planet.

==Mariners 8 and 9==
{{Main|Mariner 8|Mariner 9}}
[[Image:Mariner09.jpg|150px|right]][[Mariner 8]] and [[Mariner 9]] were identical sister craft designed to map the Martian surface simultaneously, but Mariner 8 was lost in a launch vehicle failure. Its identical sister craft, Mariner 9, was launched in May 1971 and became the first artificial satellite of Mars. It entered Martian orbit in November 1971 and began photographing the surface and analyzing the atmosphere with its infrared and ultraviolet instruments.

In Areocentric (Mars) orbit until at least 2022 when it is projected to fall out of orbit and into the Martian atmosphere.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask-academy/issues/volume4/ata_4-9_mariner_9_prt.htm NASA - This Month in NASA History: Mariner 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514043808/http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask-academy/issues/volume4/ata_4-9_mariner_9_prt.htm |date=May 14, 2013 }}, November 29, 2011 — Vol. 4, Issue 9</ref>

==Mariner 10==
{{Main|Mariner 10}}
[[Image:Mariner 10.jpg|150px|right]]The [[Mariner 10]] spacecraft launched on November 3, 1973 and was the first to use a gravity assist trajectory, accelerating as it entered the gravitational influence of Venus, then being flung by the planet's gravity onto a slightly different course to reach Mercury. It was also the first spacecraft to encounter two planets at close range, and for 33 years the only spacecraft to photograph Mercury in closeup.
* Mission: plasma, charged particles, magnetic fields, radio occultation and celestial mechanics
Status: Mariner 10 – Defunct. Now in a [[Heliocentric orbit]].

==Mariner Jupiter-Saturn==
{{main|Voyager program}}
Mariner Jupiter-Saturn was approved in 1972 after the cancellation of the [[Grand Tour program]], which proposed visiting all the outer planets with multiple spacecraft. The Mariner Jupiter-Saturn program proposed two Mariner-derived probes that would perform a scaled back mission involving flybys of only the two gas giants, though designers at JPL built the craft with the intention that further encounters past Saturn would be an option. Trajectories were chosen to allow one probe to visit Jupiter and Saturn first, and perform a flyby of Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] to gather information about the moon's substantial atmosphere. The other probe would arrive at Jupiter and Saturn later, and its trajectory would enable it to continue on to [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] assuming the first probe accomplished all its objectives, or be redirected to perform a Titan flyby if necessary. The program's name was changed to [[Voyager program|Voyager]] just before launch in 1977, and after [[Voyager 1]] successfully completed its Titan encounter, [[Voyager 2]] went on to visit the two [[ice giants]].<ref name=butrica/>
