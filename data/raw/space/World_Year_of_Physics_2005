The year 2005 was named the '''World Year of Physics''', also known as '''Einstein Year''', in recognition of the 100th anniversary of [[Albert Einstein]]'s "[[Annus Mirabilis Papers|Miracle Year]]", in which he published four landmark papers, and the subsequent advances in the field of [[physics]].

==History==

Physics has been the basis for understanding the physical world and nature as a whole. The applications of physics are the basis for much of today's technology. In order to both raise worldwide awareness of physics and celebrate the major advances made in the field, the World Congress of Physical Societies proposed<ref name=fusion>{{cite web |url=https://www.euro-fusion.org/newsletter/2005-unesco-world-year-of-physics/ |title=2005 – UNESCO World Year of Physics |publisher=Eurofusion |date=December 1, 2004 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}</ref> and the [[IUPAP|International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] resolved that 2005 should be commemorated as the World Year of Physics. This was subsequently endorsed by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=fusion/>
