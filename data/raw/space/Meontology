'''Meontology''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] study of non-being.<ref>[http://www.raco.cat/index.php/arsbrevis/article/viewFile/257019/344061 Schelling’s meontology and the concept of possibility in Kierkegaard]</ref>

==History==
The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] μή, ''me'' "non" and ὄν, ''on'' "being" (confer [[ontology]]). It refers not exactly to the study of what does not exist, but an attempt to cover what may remain outside of ontology. ''Meontology'' has a slim tradition in the West (see [[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]] and [[negative theology]]), but has always been central to the Eastern philosophies of [[Taoism]] and the later [[Buddhism]].

[[Nishida Kitaro|Nishida]] was the first to thoroughly expand the Eastern notion of nothingness in the Continental paradigm and is thus responsible for bringing to the West a clearer understanding of the Buddhist notion of non-being.

It can also be associated more recently, with the emphasis placed upon absence or deferral by both [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].

French philosopher [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] distinguishes nothingness from nothing. He writes, “Nothingness is not nothing [''rien'']....There is no ontology without the dialectic or the paradox of a meontology....Nothing is the thing tending toward its pure and simple being of a thing.” Nothing is “the vanishing, momentary quality of the smallest amount of beingness (''étantité'').” <ref>Jean-Luc Nancy, ''The Creation of the World or Globalization'', (SUNY Press. Albany, 2007, pp. 102-03.)</ref>

==Levinas on meontology==
{{importance-section|date=December 2015}}
For [[Emmanuel Levinas]], what was meontological was what had meaning beyond being, beyond ontology; for him this was the ethical, the primary demand of the other in the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] encounter. In this sense he sought to clarify or take further some of  the issues raised by Heidegger and explicitly give ontology a secondary role to ethics rather than continue to parallel them in saying that the [[Being]] means [[wikt:cura|care]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Sorge'').
