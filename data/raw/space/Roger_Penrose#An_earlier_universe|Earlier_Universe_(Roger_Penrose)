'''Sir Roger Penrose''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OM|FRS}} (born 8 August 1931) is an English [[mathematical physicist]], [[mathematics|mathematician]] and [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]]. He is [[Emeritus]] [[Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics]] in the [[University of Oxford]] and Emeritus Fellow of [[Wadham College]], Oxford.

Penrose has made contributions to the mathematical physics of [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. He has received several prizes and awards, including the 1988 [[Wolf Prize]] for physics, which he shared with [[Stephen Hawking]] for the [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]].<ref>{{Cite book|first=R|last=Penrose|title=The Road to Reality: A Complete guide to the Laws of the Universe|publisher=Vintage Books|date=2005|isbn=0-09-944068-7|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

==Early life and academia==
Born in [[Colchester]], Essex, Roger Penrose is a son of psychiatrist and geneticist [[Lionel Penrose]] and Margaret Leathes,{{efn|Penrose and his [[Lionel Penrose|father]] shared mathematical concepts with Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] which were incorporated into a lot of pieces, including [[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]], which is based on the '[[Penrose triangle]]', and [[Ascending and Descending|Up and Down]].}} and the grandson of the [[physiologist]] [[John Beresford Leathes]] and his [[Russian people|Russian]] wife, Sonia Marie Natanson,<ref name="rsbm">{{cite web|url=http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiogmem/4/185|title=John Beresford Leathes. 1864-1956|author=Rudolph Peters|website=Royal Society Publishing|date=}}</ref> who had left [[St. Petersburg]] in the late 1880s.<ref name="elementy.ru">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-EpHQ7yl9c|title=Roger Penrose.

Penrose is the brother of physicist [[Oliver Penrose]] and of [[Grandmaster (chess)|chess Grandmaster]] [[Jonathan Penrose]]. Penrose attended [[University College School]] and [[University College, London]], where he graduated with a first class degree in mathematics. In 1955, while still a student, Penrose reintroduced the [[E. H. Moore]] generalised matrix inverse, also known as the [[Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse|Moore–Penrose inverse]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Penrose|first1=R.|title=A generalized inverse for matrices|journal=[[Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]]|year=1955|volume=51|issue=03|pages=406|doi=10.1017/S0305004100030401|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=2043984|bibcode = 1955PCPS...51..406P }}</ref> after it had been reinvented by [[Arne Bjerhammar]] in 1951. Having started research under the professor of geometry and astronomy, Sir [[W. V. D. Hodge]], Penrose finished his PhD at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1958, with a thesis on "tensor methods in algebraic geometry" under algebraist and geometer [[J. A. Todd|John A. Todd]]. He devised and popularised the [[Penrose triangle]] in the 1950s, describing it as "impossibility in its purest form", and exchanged material with the artist [[M. C. Escher]], whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it. Escher's [[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]], and [[Ascending and Descending]] were in turn inspired by Penrose.

As reviewer Manjit Kumar puts it:
{{quote|As a student in 1954, Penrose was attending a conference in Amsterdam when by chance he came across an exhibition of Escher's work. Soon he was trying to conjure up impossible figures of his own and discovered the tribar [see [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Penrose-dreieck.svg tri-bar] for an image] – a triangle that looks like a real, solid three-dimensional object, but isn't. Together with his father, a physicist and mathematician, Penrose went on to design a staircase that simultaneously loops up and down. An article followed and a copy was sent to Escher. Completing a cyclical flow of creativity, the Dutch master of geometrical illusions was inspired to produce his two masterpieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/16/cycles-time-roger-penrose-review|title=Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe by Roger Penrose – review|work=The Guardian}}</ref>}}

Having become a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] at Birkbeck College, London (and having had his attention drawn from pure mathematics to astrophysics by the cosmologist [[Dennis Sciama]], then at Cambridge) it was in 1964 that, in the words of [[Kip Thorne]]  of Caltech, "Roger Penrose revolutionised the mathematical tools that we use to analyse the properties of spacetime". Until then work on the curved geometry of general relativity had been confined to configurations with sufficiently high symmetry for Einstein's equations to be soluble explicitly, and there was doubt about whether such cases were typical. One approach to this issue was by  the use of [[perturbation theory]], as developed under the leadership of [[John Archibald Wheeler]] at Princeton. The other, more radically innovative, approach initiated by Penrose was to overlook the detailed geometrical structure of spacetime and instead concentrate attention just on the topology of the space, or at most its [[conformal structure]], since it is the latter — as determined by the lay of the lightcones — that determines the trajectories of lightlike geodesics, and hence their causal relationships. The importance of Penrose's epoch-making paper "Gravitational collapse and space-time singularities"<ref name=Penrose1965>{{cite journal|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=January 1965|volume=14|issue=3|pages=57–59|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.14.57|url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.14.57|bibcode = 1965PhRvL..14...57P }}</ref> was not only its result (roughly that if an object such as a dying star implodes beyond a certain point, then nothing can prevent the gravitational field getting so strong as to form some kind of singularity). It also showed a way to obtain similarly general conclusions in other contexts, notably that of the cosmological [[Big Bang]], which he dealt with in collaboration with [[Dennis Sciama]]'s most famous student, [[Stephen Hawking]].

[[file: CNRSblackhole.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Predicted view from outside the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]] lit by a thin accretion disc]]
It was in the local context of gravitational collapse that the contribution of Penrose was most decisive, starting with his 1969 cosmic censorship conjecture, to the effect that any ensuing singularities would be confined within a well-behaved [[event horizon]] surrounding a hidden space-time region for which Wheeler coined the term [[black hole]], leaving a visible exterior region with strong but finite curvature, from which some of the gravitational energy may be extractable by what is known as the [[Penrose process]], while accretion of surrounding matter may release further energy that can account for astrophysical phenomena such as [[quasars]].

Following up his "weak [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]]",  Penrose went on, in 1979, to formulate a stronger version called the "strong censorship hypothesis". Together with the [[BKL conjecture]] and issues of nonlinear stability, settling the censorship conjectures is one of the most important outstanding problems in [[general relativity]]. Also from 1979 dates Penrose's influential [[Weyl curvature hypothesis]] on the initial conditions of the observable part of the universe and the origin of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].<ref>{{cite conference | author = R.

[[File:Roger-Penrose-Kachelstruktur.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Oil painting by Urs Schmid (1995) of a [[Penrose tiling]] using fat and thin [[rhombus|rhombi]].]]
In 1967, Penrose invented the [[twistor theory]] which maps geometric objects in [[Minkowski space]] into the 4-dimensional complex space with the metric signature (2,2). 
[[File:Penrose Tiling (Rhombi).svg|250px|thumb|left|A [[Penrose tiling]]|alt=]]
Penrose is well known for his 1974 discovery of [[Penrose tiling]]s, which are formed from two tiles that can only [[tessellation|tile]] the plane nonperiodically, and are the first tilings to exhibit fivefold rotational symmetry. Penrose developed these ideas based on the article ''Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique''<ref>Jaromír Korčák (1938): Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique. Prague, Comité d'organisation, Bull. de l'Institute Int'l de Statistique, vol. 3, pp. 295–299.</ref> (1938; an English translation ''Two Basic Types of Statistical Distribution'') by Czech [[geographer]], [[demographer]] and statistician Jaromír Korčák. In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in [[quasicrystal]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.93.25.14267 |first=Paul |last=Steinhardt |title=New perspectives on forbidden symmetries, quasicrystals, and Penrose tilings |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume=93 |issue= 25|pages=14267–14270 |date=1996 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/93/25/14267.full |pmid=8962037 |pmc=34472 |postscript=<!--None--> |bibcode = 1996PNAS...9314267S }}</ref> Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of [[spin network]]s, which later came to form the geometry of [[spacetime]] in [[loop quantum gravity]]. He was influential in popularising what are commonly known as [[Penrose diagram]]s (causal diagrams).

In 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at [[Rice University]] in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ricehistorycorner.com/2013/05/22/roger-penrose-at-rice-1983-87/|title=Roger Penrose at Rice, 1983-87|work=Rice History Corner}}</ref>

==Later activity==
In 2004, Penrose released ''[[The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe]]'', a 1,099-page comprehensive guide to the [[physical law|Laws of Physics]] that includes an explanation of his own theory.  The [[Penrose interpretation|Penrose Interpretation]] predicts the relationship between [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]], and proposes that a [[quantum state]] remains in [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] until the difference of [[space-time curvature]] attains a significant level.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/books/review/the-road-to-reality-a-really-long-history-of-time.html?_r=0 |title='The Road to Reality': A Really Long History of Time |first1=George |last1=Johnson |date=27 February 2005 |publisher=''The New York Times, USA'' |accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | title =If an Electron Can Be in Two Places at Once, Why Can't You?  | url =http://discovermagazine.com/2005/jun/cover/article_view?b_start:int=0&-C= | accessdate = 27 October 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101130211/http://discovermagazine.com/2005/jun/cover/article_view?b_start:int=0&-C= | archivedate=1 November 2012}}</ref>

On 18 December 2018, Penrose appeared on the [[Joe Rogan Experience]] podcast.

==An earlier universe==
[[File:WMAP 2010.png|thumb|300px|[[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] image of the (extremely tiny) anisotropies in the [[cosmic background radiation]]]]

In 2010, Penrose reported possible evidence, based on concentric circles found in [[WMAP]] data of the [[CMB]] sky, of an earlier universe existing before the [[Big Bang]] of our own present universe.<ref name="Gurzadyan">{{cite arXiv |last=Gurzadyan |first=V.G. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title= Concentric circles in WMAP data may provide evidence of violent pre-Big-Bang activity". volume "v1 |date=2010 |eprint= 1011.3706 |class=astro-ph.CO}}</ref> He mentions this evidence in the epilogue of his 2010 book ''Cycles of Time'',<ref>Roger Penrose, ''Cycles of Time'', Vintage; Reprint edition (1 May 2012)</ref> a book in which he presents his reasons, to do with [[Einstein's field equations]], the [[Weyl curvature]] C, and the [[Weyl curvature hypothesis]] (WCH), that the transition at the Big Bang could have been smooth enough for a previous universe to survive it. He made several conjectures about C and the WCH, some of which were subsequently proved by others, and where he also popularized his [[conformal cyclic cosmology]] (CCC) theory.

In simple terms, he believes that the singularity in [[Einstein's field equation]] at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]]. The latter singularity can be removed by a change of [[coordinate system]], and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang. One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and therefore we are not necessarily constrained by the [[Wheeler–DeWitt equation]], which disrupts time. Alternatively, one can use the [[Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations]].

==Physics and consciousness==
[[File:Roger Penrose 9671.JPG|thumb|Penrose at a conference.]]
{{Cosmology|scientists}}
Penrose has written books on the connection between fundamental physics and human (or animal) consciousness. In ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'' (1989), he argues that known laws of physics are inadequate to explain the phenomenon of consciousness. Penrose proposes the characteristics this new physics may have and specifies the requirements for a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics (what he calls ''correct quantum gravity''). Penrose uses a variant of [[Turing's halting theorem]] to demonstrate that a system can be [[deterministic]] without being [[algorithm]]ic. (For example, imagine a system with only two states, ON and OFF. If the system's state is ON when a given [[Turing machine]] halts and OFF when the Turing machine does not halt, then the system's state is completely determined by the machine; nevertheless, there is no algorithmic way to determine whether the Turing machine stops.)

Penrose believes that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may come into play in the quantum mechanical [[Wave function collapse|wave function reduction]], and may be harnessed by the brain. He argues that the present computer is unable to have intelligence because it is an algorithmically deterministic system. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer. This contrasts with supporters of [[computational theory of mind|strong artificial intelligence]], who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends [[formal logic]] because things such as the insolubility of the [[halting problem]] and [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight. These claims were originally espoused by the philosopher [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].

The [[Penrose–Lucas argument]] about the implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorem for computational theories of human intelligence has been widely criticised by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers, and the consensus among experts in these fields seems to be that the argument fails, though different authors may choose different aspects of the argument to attack.<ref>

Sources that also note that different sources attack different points of the argument:

There are at least three points at which the argument may be attacked."

Sutcliffe and [[Andrei Voronkov]], eds., Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 3835, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, pp. 125–138.</ref> [[Marvin Minsky]], a leading proponent of artificial intelligence, was particularly critical, stating that Penrose "tries to show, in chapter after chapter, that human thought cannot be based on any known scientific principle." Minsky's position is exactly the opposite – he believed that humans are, in fact, machines, whose functioning, although complex, is fully explainable by current physics. Minsky maintained that "one can carry that quest [for scientific explanation] too far by only seeking new basic principles instead of attacking the real detail. This is what I see in Penrose's quest for a new basic principle of physics that will account for consciousness."<ref>Marvin Minsky. "Conscious Machines."

Penrose responded to criticism of ''The Emperor's New Mind'' with his follow up 1994 book ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]'', and in 1997 with ''[[The Large, the Small and the Human Mind]]''. In those works, he also combined his observations with that of anesthesiologist [[Stuart Hameroff]].

Penrose and Hameroff have argued that [[consciousness]] is the result of quantum gravity effects in [[microtubule]]s, which they dubbed [[Orch-OR]] (orchestrated objective reduction). [[Max Tegmark]], in a paper in ''Physical Review E'',<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tegmark | first1 = Max | date = 2000 | title = The importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes | url = | journal = [[Physical Review E]] | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 4194–4206 | doi=10.1103/physreve.61.4194|arxiv = quant-ph/9907009 |bibcode = 2000PhRvE..61.4194T }}</ref> calculated that the time scale of neuron firing and excitations in microtubules is slower than the [[quantum decoherence|decoherence]] time by a factor of at least 10,000,000,000.

It's reasonably unlikely that the brain evolved quantum behavior'".<ref name="Tetlow 2007 166">{{cite book

This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24&nbsp;nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, but still well short of the 25&nbsp;ms required if the quantum processing in the theory was to be linked to the 40&nbsp;Hz gamma synchrony, as Orch-OR suggested. To bridge this gap, the group made a series of proposals.

They supposed that the interiors of neurons could alternate between liquid and [[gel]] states. In the gel state, it was further hypothesized that the water electrical dipoles are oriented in the same direction, along the outer edge of the microtubule tubulin subunits. Hameroff et al. proposed that this ordered water could screen any quantum coherence within the tubulin of the microtubules from the environment of the rest of the brain. Each tubulin also has a tail extending out from the microtubules, which is negatively charged, and therefore attracts positively charged ions. It is suggested that this could provide further screening. Further to this, there was a suggestion that the microtubules could be pumped into a coherent state by biochemical energy. [[File:Penrose in University of Santiago de Compostela to picked up the Fonseca prize.jpg|thumb|Roger Penrose in the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] to receive the [[Fonseca Prize]].]] Finally, he suggested that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for quantum error correction, a means of holding together quantum coherence in the face of environmental interaction.

Hameroff, in a lecture in part of a Google Tech talks series exploring [[quantum biology]], gave an overview of current research in the area, and responded to subsequent criticisms of the Orch-OR model.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFFbxoHp3s |title=Clarifying the Tubulin bit/qubit – Defending the Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR Model (Quantum Biology) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref> In addition to this, a 2011 paper by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff published in the fringe ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]'' gives an updated model of their Orch-OR theory, in light of criticisms, and discusses the place of consciousness within the universe.<ref name="Hameroff-Penrose 2011">{{cite web |author=Roger Penrose |author2=Stuart Hameroff |last-author-amp=yes |url=http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/Cosmology160.html |title=Consciousness in the Universe: Neuroscience, Quantum Space-Time Geometry and Orch OR Theory |journal=[[Journal of Cosmology]] |publisher=Quantumconsciousness.org |date=4 July 1992 |accessdate=13 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616045402/http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/Cosmology160.html |archivedate=16 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Phillip Tetlow, although himself supportive of Penrose's views, acknowledges that Penrose's ideas about the human thought process are at present a minority view in scientific circles, citing Minsky's criticisms and quoting science journalist [[Charles Seife]]'s description of Penrose as "one of a handful of scientists" who believe that the nature of consciousness suggests a quantum process.<ref name="Tetlow 2007 166"/>
