'''Space exploration''' is the [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] and [[exploration]] of [[Sky|celestial]] structures in [[outer space]] by means of evolving and growing [[space technology]]. While the study of space is carried out mainly by [[astronomer]]s with [[telescope]]s, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by [[unmanned robotic space probes]] and [[human spaceflight]].

While the observation of objects in space, known as [[astronomy]], predates reliable [[recorded history]], it was the development of large and relatively efficient [[rocket]]s during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.<ref name="NYT-20150828">{{cite news |last=Roston |first=Michael |title=NASA’s Next Horizon in Space |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/25/science/space/nasa-next-mission.html |date=28 August 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=28 August 2015 }}</ref>

Space exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the [[Cold War]]. The early era of space exploration was driven by a "[[Space Race]]" between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. The launch of the first human-made object to orbit [[Earth]], the Soviet Union's [[Sputnik 1]], on 4 October 1957, and the first [[Moon landing]] by the American [[Apollo 11]] mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet Space Program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first [[human spaceflight]] ([[Yuri Gagarin]] aboard ''[[Vostok 1]]'') in 1961, the first [[spacewalk]] (by [[Aleksei Leonov]]) on 18 March 1965, the [[Luna 9|first automatic landing]] on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first [[space station]] (''[[Salyut 1]]'') in 1971.
After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the [[Space Shuttle program]], and from competition to cooperation as with the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).

With the substantial completion of the ISS<ref name="space-11078">{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/11078-space-station-complete.html |title=After 13 Years, International Space Station Has All Its NASA Rooms |first=Denise |last=Chow |publisher=Space.com |date=9 March 2011 }}</ref> following [[STS-133]] in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remain in flux.

The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the [[International Space Station|ISS]] beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from [[NASA]] to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as [[Lagrangian point|Earth–Moon L1]], the Moon, [[Lagrangian point|Earth–Sun L2]], near-Earth asteroids, and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] or Mars orbit.<ref name="obama">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/about/obamaspeechfeature_prt.htm |work=Address at KSC |date=15 April 2010 |title=President Outlines Exploration Goals, Promise }}</ref>

In the 2000s, the People's Republic of China initiated a [[Chinese space program|successful manned spaceflight program]], while the [[European Union]], Japan, and [[India]] have also planned future crewed space missions. China, Russia, Japan, and India have advocated crewed missions to the Moon during the 21st century, while the European Union has advocated [[Aurora programme|manned missions to both the Moon and Mars]] during the 20th and 21st century.

From the 1990s onwards, private interests began promoting [[space tourism]] and then public space exploration of the Moon (see [[Google Lunar X Prize]]).

They carried small payloads that allowed them to measure attributes including air temperature and cosmic ray impacts.]]

===Telescope===
The first [[telescope]] was invented in 1608 in the [[Netherlands]] by an [[eyeglass]] maker named [[Hans Lippershey]]. The [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2]] was the first [[space telescope]] launched on December 7, 1968.<ref name=joseph>{{cite book|author=Joseph A. Angelo|title=Spacecraft for Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8BMepjeciEC&pg=PA20|year=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0896-4|page=20}}</ref>

===First outer space flights===

[[File:Sputnik asm.jpg|thumb|''[[Sputnik 1]]'', the first artificial [[satellite]] orbited Earth at {{convert|939|to|215|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1957, and was soon followed by ''[[Sputnik 2]]''. See [[Satellite#First satellites of countries|First satellite by country]] (Replica Pictured) ]]
[[File:Apollo CSM lunar orbit.jpg|thumb|Apollo CSM in lunar orbit]]
[[File:Moon-apollo17-schmitt boulder.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 17]] astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] standing next to a boulder at Taurus-Littrow. ]]

The first successful orbital launch was of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] uncrewed ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' ("Satellite 1") mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed about {{convert|83|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}}. It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40&nbsp;MHz), which emitted "beeps" that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data was encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a [[meteoroid]]. ''Sputnik 1'' was launched by an [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] rocket. It burned up upon re-entry on 3 January 1958.

The second one was ''[[Sputnik 2]]''. Launched by the USSR on November 3, 1957, it carried the dog [[Laika]], who became the first animal in orbit.

This success led to an escalation of the American [[space program]], which unsuccessfully attempted to launch [[Vanguard TV3|a Vanguard satellite]] into orbit two months later. On 31 January 1958, the U.S. successfully orbited ''[[Explorer 1]]'' on a Juno rocket.

===First human outer space flight===
The first successful human spaceflight was ''[[Vostok 1]]'' ("East 1"), carrying 27-year-old Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced [[Soviet space program]] and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration: [[human spaceflight]].

=== First astronomical body explorations ===
The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was [[Luna 2]] reaching the [[Moon]] in 1959.<ref name="jpl-luna2">{{cite web|url=http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&Target=Moon&MCode=Luna_02 |title=NASA on Luna 2 mission |publisher=Sse.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331155310/http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&Target=Moon&MCode=Luna_02 |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}</ref> The first [[Soft landing (aeronautics)|soft landing]] on another celestial body was performed by [[Luna 9]] landing on the Moon on February 3rd, 1966.<ref name="jpl.luna9">{{cite web|url=http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&Target=Moon&MCode=Luna_09 |title=NASA on Luna 9 mission |publisher=Sse.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331155324/http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&Target=Moon&MCode=Luna_09 |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}</ref> [[Luna 10]] became the first artificial satellite of the Moon, entering Moon Orbit on April 3, 1966.<ref name="jpl-luna10">{{cite web|url=http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&Target=Moon&MCode=Luna_10 |title=NASA on Luna 10 mission |publisher=Sse.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218232128/http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&Target=Moon&MCode=Luna_10 |archivedate=18 February 2012 |df= }}</ref>

The first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by [[Apollo 11]] on July 20th, 1969, landing on the Moon.

The first interplanetary [[Flyby (spaceflight)|flyby]] was the  1961 [[Venera 1]] flyby of [[Venus]], though the 1962 [[Mariner 2]] was the first flyby of [[Venus]] to return data (closest approach 34,773 kilometers). [[Pioneer 6, 7, 8, and 9|Pioneer 6]] was the first satellite to orbit the [[Sun]], launched on December 16, 1965. The other planets were first flown by in 1965 for [[Mars]] by [[Mariner 4]], 1973 for [[Jupiter]] by ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', 1974 for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] by [[Mariner 10]], 1979 for [[Saturn]] by ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', 1986 for [[Uranus]] by ''[[Voyager 2]]'', 1989 for [[Neptune]] by ''[[Voyager 2]]''. In 2015, the [[dwarf planet]]s [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] and [[Pluto]] were orbited by ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' and passed by ''[[New Horizons]]'', respectively. This accounts for flybys to each of the seven planets outside of Earth in our [[Solar System]].

The first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of [[Venera 7]] which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes from [[Venus]]. In 1975 the [[Venera 9]] was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from [[Venus]]. In 1971 the [[Mars 3]] mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds. Later much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation by [[Viking 1]] from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by [[Venera 13]] in 1982, the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission. Venus and Mars are the two planets outside of Earth we have conducted surface missions on with unmanned [[robotic spacecraft]].

=== First space station ===

[[Salyut 1]] was the first [[space station]] of any kind, launched into [[low Earth orbit]] by the [[Soviet Union]] on April 19, 1971.

===First interstellar space flight===

[[Voyager 1]] became the first human-made object to [[List of artificial objects leaving the Solar System|leave our Solar System]] into [[Outer space#Interstellar space|interstellar space]] on August 25th, 2012. The probe passed the [[Heliopause (astronomy)#Heliopause|heliopause]] at 121 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] to enter [[Interstellar medium|interstellar space]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Voyager 1 finally crosses into interstellar space |first=William|last=Harwood |work=[[CBS News]] |date=September 12, 2013 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57602736/voyager-1-finally-crosses-into-interstellar-space/}}</ref>

=== Key people in early space exploration ===
The dream of stepping into the outer reaches of Earth's atmosphere was driven by the fiction of [[Jules Verne]]<ref name="russsw">{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/tsiolkovsky_bio.html |title=Tsiolkovsky biography |publisher=Russianspaceweb.com |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510054840/http://russianspaceweb.com/tsiolkovsky_bio.html |archivedate=10 May 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref name="oberth">{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/SPACEFLIGHT/oberth/SP2.htm |title=Herman Oberth |publisher=centennialofflight.net |date=29 December 1989 |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}</ref><ref name="nasa-vbbio">{{cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/bio.html |title=Von Braun |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}</ref> and [[H.

Wells]],<ref name="genesis-goddard">{{cite web |url=http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/people/biographies/goddard.pdf |title=Goddard Biography |format=PDF |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}</ref> and rocket technology was developed to try to realize this vision. The German [[V-2]] was the first rocket to travel into space, overcoming the problems of thrust and material failure. During the final days of World War II this technology was obtained by both the Americans and Soviets as were its designers. The initial driving force for further development of the technology was a weapons race for intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBM]]s) to be used as long-range carriers for fast [[nuclear weapon]] delivery, but in 1961 when the [[Soviet Union]] launched the first man into space, the United States declared itself to be in a "[[Space Race]]" with the Soviets.

'''[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], [[Robert Goddard]], [[Hermann Oberth]]''', and '''[[Reinhold Tiling]]''' laid the groundwork of rocketry in the early years of the 20th century.

'''[[Wernher von Braun]]''' was the lead rocket engineer for [[Nazi]] Germany's World War II [[V-2]] rocket project. In the last days of the war he led a caravan of workers in the German rocket program to the American lines, where they surrendered and were brought to the United States to work on their rocket development ("[[Operation Paperclip]]"). He acquired American citizenship and led the team that developed and launched ''[[Explorer 1]]'', the first American satellite. Von Braun later led the team at [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] which developed the [[Saturn V]] moon rocket.

Initially the race for space was often led by '''[[Sergei Korolev]]''', whose legacy includes both the [[R-7 Semyorka|R7]] and [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]]—which remain in service to this day. Korolev was the mastermind behind the first satellite, first man (and first woman) in orbit and first spacewalk. Until his death his identity was a closely guarded state secret; not even his mother knew that he was responsible for creating the Soviet space program.

'''[[Kerim Kerimov]]''' was one of the founders of the [[Soviet space program]] and was one of the lead architects behind the first [[human spaceflight]] (''[[Vostok 1]]'') alongside Sergey Korolev. After Korolev's death in 1966, Kerimov became the lead scientist of the Soviet space program and was responsible for the launch of the first [[space station]]s from 1971 to 1991, including the [[Salyut]] and [[Mir]] series, and their precursors in 1967, the [[Cosmos 186]] and [[Cosmos 188]].<ref name="find">{{cite news |last=Bond |first=Peter |publication-date=7 April 2003 |title=Obituary: Lt-Gen Kerim Kerimov |periodical=The Independent |publication-place=London |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030407/ai_n12692130 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108073958/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030407/ai_n12692130 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2010 }}</ref><ref name="az-1995">{{cite journal |first=Blair |last=Betty |year=1995 |title=Behind Soviet Aeronauts |url= |journal=[[Azerbaijan International]] |volume=3 |page=3 }}</ref>

Other key people:
* '''[[Valentin Glushko]]''' was Chief Engine Designer for the Soviet Union. Glushko designed many of the engines used on the early Soviet rockets, but was constantly at odds with Korolev.
* '''[[Vasily Mishin]]''' was Chief Designer working under Sergey Korolev and one of the first Soviets to inspect the captured German V-2 design. Following the death of Sergei Korolev, Mishin was held responsible for the Soviet failure to be first country to place a man on the Moon.
* '''[[Robert Gilruth]]''' was the [[NASA]] head of the Space Task Force and director of 25 crewed space flights. Gilruth was the person who suggested to [[John F. Kennedy]] that the Americans take the bold step of reaching the Moon in an attempt to reclaim space superiority from the Soviets.
* '''[[Christopher C. Kraft, Jr.]]''' was NASA's first [[flight controller|flight director]], who oversaw development of [[Mission Control]] and associated technologies and procedures.
* '''[[Maxime Faget]]''' was the designer of the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule; he played a key role in designing the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] spacecraft, and contributed to the design of the [[Space Shuttle]].

==Targets of exploration==
===The Sun===
Although the [[Sun]] will probably not be physically explored at all, the study of the Sun has nevertheless been a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth's magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth's surface. The Sun generates most [[space weather]], which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective. [[Parker Solar Probe]], launched in 2018, will approach the Sun to within 1/8th the orbit of Mercury.

===Mercury===
[[File:Mercury as Never Seen Before.jpg|thumb|left|125px|''[[MESSENGER]]'' image of Mercury (2013)]] [[File:MESSENGER EN0108828359M.png|thumb|130x130px|A ''MESSENGER'' image from 18,000&nbsp;km showing a region about 500&nbsp;km across (2008)]] [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] remains the least explored of the [[Terrestrial planets]]. As of May 2013, the [[Mariner 10]] and ''[[MESSENGER]]'' missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury. ''MESSENGER'' entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 (Munsell, 2006b).
A third mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in 2025, [[BepiColombo]] is to include two [[space probe|probes]]. BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the [[European Space Agency]]. ''MESSENGER'' and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10's [[Gravitational slingshot|flybys]].

Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or [[delta-v]]. Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable.

===Venus===
[[File:Venus-real color.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[Mariner 10]] image of Venus (1974)]]

{{Main|Observations and explorations of Venus}}
[[Venus]] was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first flyby was the 1961 [[Venera 1]], though the 1962 [[Mariner 2]] was the first flyby to successfully return data. Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a [[Gravity assist|gravitational assist]] en route to other celestial bodies. In 1967 [[Venera 4]] became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970, [[Venera 7]] became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975 with the Soviet orbiter [[Venera 9]] some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using [[radar]] to pierce the obscuring atmosphere.

===Earth===

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|left|125px|''[[The Blue Marble]]'' Earth picture taken during [[Apollo 17]] (1972)]]

{{Main|Earth observation satellite}}
Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object in its own right. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference.

For example, the existence of the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s was unknown until their discovery by the United States' first artificial satellite, ''[[Explorer 1]]''. These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000&nbsp;km impractical.
Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, the [[Ozone depletion|hole in the ozone layer]] was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify.

===The Moon===
[[File:FullMoon2010.jpg|thumb|The [[Moon]] (2010)|left|130x130px]]{{Main|Exploration of the Moon}}
[[File:Apollo 16 LM Orion.jpg|thumbnail|[[Apollo 16]] LEM Orion, the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] and astronaut [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] (1972)]]
The [[Moon]] was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans.

In 1959 the Soviets obtained the first images of the [[far side of the Moon]], never previously visible to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with the [[Ranger 4]] impactor in 1962. Starting in 1966 the Soviets successfully deployed a number of [[Lander (spacecraft)|landers]] to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later, ''[[Surveyor 1]]'' marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the [[Lunokhod programme|Lunokhod program]] in the early 1970s, which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully [[Sample return mission|brought lunar soil samples to Earth]] for study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth. Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters, and in 2008 the Indian [[Moon Impact Probe]].

Crewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the [[Apollo 8]] mission that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In 1969, the [[Apollo 11]] mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long, however. The [[Apollo 17]] mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit there, and the next, [[Exploration Mission 2]], is due to orbit the Moon in 2023. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously.

===Mars===
[[File:Mars 23 aug 2003 hubble.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Mars, as seen by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (2003)]]

[[File:Spirit rover tracks.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Surface of Mars by the [[Mars Exploration Rover|''Spirit'' rover]] (2004)]]
{{Main|Exploration of Mars}}
The exploration of [[Mars]] has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Dozens of [[robotic spacecraft]], including [[orbiter]]s, [[Lander (spacecraft)|landers]], and [[rover (space exploration)|rovers]], have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth.

The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of ''The Great Galactic Ghoul''<ref name="space-232">{{cite web |last=Dinerman |first=Taylor |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/232/1 |title=Is the Great Galactic Ghoul losing his appetite? |work=The space review |date=27 September 2004 |accessdate=27 March 2007 }}</ref> which subsists on a diet of Mars probes.

===Jupiter===
[[File:Jupiter and its shrunken Great Red Spot.jpg|thumb|Jupiter, as seen by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (2014).|left|125x125px]]{{Main|Exploration of Jupiter}}The exploration of [[Jupiter]] has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973. A large majority of the missions have been "flybys", in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as in [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] and [[Voyager program|Voyager]] programs. The ''[[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]]'' and ''[[Juno spacecraft|Juno]]'' spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet's orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is precluded.

Reaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2&nbsp;km/s,<ref name="delta-v">{{cite web |last=Wong |first=Al |date=28 May 1998 |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/faqnav.html |title=Galileo FAQ: Navigation |publisher=NASA |accessdate=28 November 2006 }}</ref> which is comparable to the 9.7&nbsp;km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.<ref name="pma-delta">{{cite web |last=Hirata |first=Chris |url=http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |title=Delta-V in the Solar System |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=28 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715015836/http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |archivedate=15 July 2006 }}</ref> Fortunately, [[Gravitational slingshot|gravity assists]] through [[planetary flyby]]s can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration.<ref name="delta-v" />

Jupiter has 79 [[Moons of Jupiter|known moons]], many of which have relatively little known information about them.

===Saturn===
[[File:Ringworld Waiting.jpg|thumb|A picture of Saturn taken by ''[[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]] (2004)''|left|180x180px]]
{{Main|Exploration of Saturn}}
[[File:Titan Saturn Moon.jpg|thumb|164x164px|A view beneath the clouds of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], as seen in false colour, created from a mosaic of images taken by ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' (2013)]]
[[Saturn]] has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission (''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'') planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions consist of flybys in 1979 by ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', in 1980 by ''[[Voyager 1]]'', in 1982 by ''[[Voyager 2]]'' and an orbital mission by the ''Cassini'' spacecraft, which lasted from 2004 until 2017.

Saturn has at least 62 [[Moons of Saturn|known moons]], although the exact number is debatable since Saturn's rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes. The largest of the moons is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth.  Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander, the ''Huygens'' probe deployed by the ''Cassini'' spacecraft.

===Uranus===
[[File:Uranus.jpg|thumb|[[Uranus]] as imaged by ''[[Voyager 2]] (1986)''|left|125x125px]]
{{Main|Exploration of Uranus}}
The exploration of [[Uranus]] has been entirely through the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' spacecraft, with no other visits currently planned. Given its [[axial tilt]] of 97.77°, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986. ''Voyager 2'' studied the planet's unique atmosphere and [[magnetosphere]]. ''Voyager 2'' also examined its [[Rings of Uranus|ring system]] and the [[moons of Uranus]] including all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons.

Images of Uranus proved to have a very uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be unique, being profoundly affected by the planet's unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence that [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]] had been unusually geologically active.

===Neptune===
[[File:Neptune Full.jpg|thumb|left|125px|A picture of [[Neptune]] taken by ''[[Voyager 2]] (1989)'']]{{main|Exploration of Neptune}}[[File:Triton moon mosaic Voyager 2 (large).jpg|thumb|125px|[[Triton (moon)|Triton]] as imaged by ''[[Voyager 2]] (1989)'']]

The exploration of Neptune began with the 25 August 1989 ''[[Voyager 2]]'' flyby, the sole visit to the system as of 2014. The possibility of a [[Neptune Orbiter]] has been discussed, but no other missions have been given serious thought.

Although the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds, [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroras]], and even a conspicuous [[Great Dark Spot|anticyclone storm system]] rivaled in size only by Jupiter's small Spot. Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as 2,100&nbsp;km/h.<ref name="Suomi1991">{{cite journal |last=Suomi |first=V.E. |last2=Limaye |first2=S.S. |last3=Johnson |first3=D.R. |title=High winds of Neptune: A possible mechanism |journal=Science |year=1991 |volume=251 |pages=929–932 |bibcode=1991Sci...251..929S  |doi=10.1126/science.251.4996.929 |pmid=17847386 |issue=4996 }}</ref> ''Voyager 2'' also examined Neptune's ring and moon system. It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring "arcs" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune's three previously known moons, ''Voyager 2'' also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which, [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]], proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data from ''Voyager 2'' supported the view that Neptune's largest moon, [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], is a captured [[Kuiper belt]] object.<ref name="Agnor06">{{cite journal |last=Agnor |first=C.B. |last2=Hamilton |first2=D.P. |title=Neptune's capture of its moon Triton in a binary-planet gravitational encounter |journal=Nature |year=2006 |volume=441 |pages = 192–194 |doi=10.1038/nature04792 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7090/abs/nature04792.html |accessdate=10 May 2006 |pmid=16688170 |issue=7090 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..192A }}</ref>

===Other objects in the Solar System===

The [[dwarf planet]] Pluto  presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times) and small mass (making capture into orbit very difficult at present). ''[[Voyager 1]]'' could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby. ''[[Voyager 2]]'' never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto.<ref name="jpl-faq">{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/faq.html |title=Voyager Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=8 September 2006 |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=14 January 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050617/http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/faq.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Pluto continues to be of great interest, despite its reclassification as the lead and nearest member of a new and growing class of distant icy bodies of intermediate size (and also the first member of the important subclass, defined by orbit and known as "[[plutino]]s"). After an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbed ''[[New Horizons]]'' was granted funding from the United States government in 2003.<ref name="s4p">{{cite web |title=Pluto mission gets green light at last |first=Robert |last=Roy Britt |work=space.com |url=http://www.space4peace.org/articles/plutomissiongetsok.htm |date=26 February 2003 |publisher=Space4Peace.org |accessdate=26 December 2013 }}</ref> ''New Horizons'' was launched successfully on 19 January 2006. In early 2007 the craft made use of a [[gravity assist]] from [[Jupiter]]. Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015; scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter.

===Asteroids and comets===
{{Main|Exploration of the asteroids|List of missions to comets}}
[[File:495296main epoxi-1-full full.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Comet [[103P/Hartley]] (2010)]]
[[File:Dawn-image-070911.jpg|thumb|125px|Asteroid [[4 Vesta]], imaged by the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'' spacecraft]] (2011)]]
Until the advent of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], objects in the [[asteroid belt]] were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery.
Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which was ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'', which flew past two: [[951 Gaspra]] in 1991, followed by [[243 Ida]] in 1993. Both of these lay near enough to ''Galileo'''s planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the ''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]'' probe in 2000, following an orbital survey of the object. The dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] and the asteroid [[4 Vesta]], two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA's [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'' spacecraft]], launched in 2007.

Although many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries-worth of observations, only a few comets have been closely visited. In 1985, the ''[[International Cometary Explorer]]'' conducted the first comet fly-by ([[21P/Giacobini-Zinner]]) before joining the [[Halley Armada]] studying the famous comet. The [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|''Deep Impact'' probe]] smashed into [[9P/Tempel]] to learn more about its structure and composition and the [[Stardust (spacecraft)|''Stardust'' mission]] returned samples of another comet's tail. The [[Philae (spacecraft)|''Philae'' lander]] successfully landed on [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko|Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko]] in 2014 as part of the broader [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'' mission]].

''[[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]]'' was an [[Robotic spacecraft|unmanned spacecraft]] developed by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] to [[Sample return mission|return a sample of material]] from the small near-Earth asteroid [[25143 Itokawa]] to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa, ''Hayabusa'' studied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010.

===Government plans===
In the 2000s, several plans for space exploration were announced; both government entities and the private sector have space exploration objectives. China has announced plans to have a 60-ton multi-module space station in orbit by 2020.

The [[NASA Authorization Act of 2010]] provided a re-prioritized list of objectives for the American space program, as well as funding for the first priorities. NASA proposes to move forward with the development of the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS), which will be designed to carry the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle]], as well as important cargo, equipment, and science experiments to Earth's orbit and destinations beyond. Additionally, the SLS will serve as a back up for commercial and international partner transportation services to the International Space Station. The SLS rocket will incorporate technological investments from the Space Shuttle program and the Constellation program in order to take advantage of proven hardware and reduce development and operations costs. The first developmental flight is targeted for the end of 2017.<ref name="nasa-sls1">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/sls1.html/ |title=NASA Announces Design for New Deep Space Exploration System |website= |publisher=NASA |date=14 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921160159/http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/sls1.html |archivedate=21 September 2011 |df= }}</ref>

===High level automated systems===
The idea of using high level automated systems for space missions has become a desirable goal to space agencies all around the world. Such systems are believed to yield benefits such as lower cost, less human oversight, and ability to explore deeper in space which is usually restricted by long communications with human controllers.<ref name="ebscohost">{{cite web |url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=98ac372f-074d-4ce4-9c53-5dcd6a91b385%40sessionmgr110&vid=2&hid=107&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=asf&AN=501525230 |title=Autonomy in Space: Current Capabilities and Future Challenges |website= |publisher= |date=Winter 2007}}</ref>

====Autonomous system====
Autonomy is defined by three requirements:<ref name="ebscohost" />
# Being able to sense the world and their state, make decisions, and carry them out on their own
# Can interpret the given goal as a list of actions to take
# Fail flexibly

====Benefits====
Autonomous technologies would be able to perform beyond predetermined actions. They would analyze all possible states and events happening around them and come up with a safe response. In addition, such technologies can reduce launch cost and ground involvement. Performance would increase as well. Autonomy would be able to quickly respond upon encountering an unforeseen event, especially in deep space exploration where communication back to Earth would take too long.<ref name="ebscohost" />

====NASA's Autonomous Science Experiment====
NASA began its autonomous science experiment (ASE) on Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) which is NASA's first satellite in the new millennium program Earth-observing series launched on 21 November 2000. The autonomy of ASE is capable of on-board science analysis, replanning, robust execution, and later the addition of model-based diagnostic. Images obtained by the EO-1 are analyzed on-board and downlinked when a change or an interesting event occur. The ASE software has successfully provided over 10,000 science images.<ref name="ebscohost" />

===Asteroids in space exploration===
{{main|Exploration of the asteroids}}An article in science magazine ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Binzel|first=Richard P.|date=2014-10-30|title=Human spaceflight: Find asteroids to get to Mars|url=http://www.nature.com/news/human-spaceflight-find-asteroids-to-get-to-mars-1.16216|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=514|issue=7524|pages=559–561|doi=10.1038/514559a|pmid=25355345|bibcode=2014Natur.514..559B}}</ref> In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, "a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit"; second,  "extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars"; and finally,  "developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin."<ref name=":0" /> Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them in times of greater risk to radiation exposure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/02/110210-mars-trip-asteroids-taxi-cosmic-rays-hitchhikers-space-science/|title=Astronauts Could Ride Asteroids to Mars, Study Says|date=2011-02-10|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref>

The research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such as [[NASA]] and [[Roscosmos]], is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such as [[NASA spin-off]]s), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program.<ref name="doi-1023">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1020207506064| year = 2002| last1 = Hertzfeld | first1 = H.

Another claim is that space exploration is a necessity to mankind and that staying on Earth will lead to [[Human extinction|extinction]]. Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic. [[Stephen Hawking]], renowned British theoretical physicist, said that "I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space.

Overall, the public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration. According to an [[Associated Press]] Poll conducted in July 2003, 71% of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is "a good investment", compared to 21% who did not.<ref name="poll-2">{{cite web |url=http://www.pollingreport.com/space2.htm |publisher=Pollingreport.com |title=Origin of Human Life – USA Today/Gallup Poll |date=3 July 2007 |accessdate=25 December 2013 }}</ref>

Clarke]] (1950) presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monograph ''Interplanetary Flight''.<ref name="intro-ast">{{cite book |first=Arthur C. |last=Clarke |title=Interplanetary Flight – An Introduction to Astronautics |publisher=Harper & Brothers |location=New York |year=1950 |chapter=10 }}</ref> He argued that humanity's choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death. Some analysts have even argued for creating an International Bank, exclusively to support deep space exploration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/82860/|title=IBSES: International Bank for Space Exploration and Sciences|last=Hegadekatti|first=Kartik|date=2017-03-30|website=mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de|language=en|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/IBSES_International_Bank_for_Space_Explo.html?id=jRGYtAEACAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=IBSES: International Bank for Space Exploration and Sciences|last=Hegadekatti|first=Kartik|date=2017|publisher=Social Science Research Network|language=en}}</ref>

===Spaceflight===
{{Main|Spaceflight}}
''Spaceflight'' is the use of [[space technology]] to achieve the flight of [[spacecraft]] into and through outer space.

Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like [[space tourism]] and [[telecommunications satellite|satellite telecommunications]]. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include [[Space observatory|space observatories]], [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and other [[Earth observation satellite]]s.

A spaceflight typically begins with a [[rocket launch]], which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of [[gravity]] and propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called [[astrodynamics]]. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during [[atmospheric reentry]], and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.

===Satellites===
{{Main|Satellite}}

Satellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. [[Space station]]s and human [[spacecraft]] in orbit are also satellites.

===Commercialization of space===
{{Main|Commercialization of space}}
Current examples of the commercial use of space include [[satellite navigation system]]s, satellite television and [[satellite radio]]. [[Space tourism]] is the recent phenomenon of [[Human spaceflight|space travel]] by individuals for the purpose of personal pleasure.

[[Private spaceflight|Private spaceflight companies]] such as [[SpaceX]] and [[Blue Origin]], and [[Orbital Technologies Commercial Space Station|commercial space stations]] such as the Axiom Space and the [[Bigelow Commercial Space Station]] have dramatically changed the landscape of space exploration, and will continue to do so in the near future.

===Alien life===
{{Main|Astrobiology|Extraterrestrial life}}
Astrobiology is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of life in the universe, combining aspects of [[astronomy]], [[biology]] and geology.<ref name="NASAastrobio">{{cite web |url=http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/ |title=NASA Astrobiology |publisher=Astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928003207/http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/ |archivedate=28 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is focused primarily on the study of the [[origin of life|origin]], distribution and [[evolution]] of life. It is also known as '''exobiology''' (from Greek: έξω, ''exo'', "outside").<ref name="aleph-x">{{cite web |url=http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Words/x.html |title=X |publisher=Aleph.se |date=11 March 2000 |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}</ref><ref name="www-pho">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/phobias.htm |title=Fears and dreads |publisher=World Wide Words |date=31 May 1997 |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}</ref><ref name="itw-1066">{{cite web |url=http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/11647/1066/ |title=iTWire – Scientists will look for alien life, but Where and How? |publisher=Itwire.com.au |date=27 April 2007 |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014092633/http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/11647/1066/ |archive-date=14 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  The term "Xenobiology" has been used as well, but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means "biology of the foreigners".<ref name="bio-ast">{{cite web |url=http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html |title=Astrobiology |publisher=Biocab.org |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}</ref>  Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth.<ref name="AstroDNA">{{cite web |title=Launching the Alien Debates |last=Ward |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Ward (paleontologist) |url=http://www.astrobio.net/debate/2168/launching-the-alien-debates |date=8 December 2006 |publisher=''[[Astrobiology Magazine]]'' |accessdate=25 December 2013 }}</ref> In the Solar System some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan.<ref name="sc-extra">{{cite web|url=http://spacechronology.com/extra.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714162249/http://spacechronology.com/extra.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2012 |title=Astrobiology: the quest for extraterrestrial life |publisher=Spacechronology.com |date=29 September 2010 |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}</ref>

===Living in space===
{{Main|Space colonization|Space habitat|Space Station}}
[[File:S122e008264.jpg|thumb|The [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Columbus Module]] at the [[International Space Station]], launched into space on the US Space Shuttle mission [[STS-122]] in 2008]]
[[File:Bernal sphere interior.jpg|thumb|350px|Artist's conception of the interior of a [[Bernal sphere]]]]
Space colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) human [[Space habitat|habitation]] of locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as the [[Colonization of the Moon|Moon]] or [[Colonization of Mars|Mars]], using significant amounts of [[in-situ resource utilization]].

To date, the longest human occupation of space is the [[International Space Station]] which has been in continuous use for {{age in years and days|2000|11|02}}. [[Valeri Polyakov]]'s record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard the [[Mir]] space station has not been surpassed. Long-term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune system suppression, and radiation exposure.

Many past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a "stepping stone" to the other planets, especially Mars. At the end of 2006 NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024.<ref name="nasa-164021">{{cite press release |title=Global Exploration Strategy and Lunar Architecture |publisher=NASA |date=4 December 2006 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/164021main_lunar_architecture.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=5 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614040311/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/164021main_lunar_architecture.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2007 }}</ref>

Beyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of [[private property]], the inability or difficulty in establishing [[property rights]] in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent of [[space technology]] in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of [[Sovereign state|national]] [[Land claim|territorial claims]] in [[outer space]] and on [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] has been specifically proscribed by the [[Outer Space Treaty]], which had been, {{asof|2012|lc=y}}, ratified by all [[Spacefaring|spacefaring nations]].<ref name="tna2012fall">{{cite journal|last=Simberg |first=Rand |title=Property Rights in Space |journal=The New Atlantis |date=Fall 2012 |issue=37 |pages=20–31 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/property-rights-in-space |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215001750/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/property-rights-in-space |archivedate=15 December 2012 |df= }}</ref>
