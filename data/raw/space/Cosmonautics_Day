==History==
The commemorative day was established in the [[Soviet Union]] one year later, on 9 April 1962.  In modern Russia, it is celebrated in accordance with Article 1.1 of the Law "On the Days of Military Glory and the Commemorative Dates in Russia".<ref name="32FZ" />

Gagarin's flight was a triumph for the [[Soviet space program]], and opened a new era in the history of space exploration. Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and [[Eastern Bloc]] and a famous figure around the world. Major newspapers around the globe published his biography and details of his flight. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was second only to World War II Victory Parades. Gagarin was escorted in a long motorcade of high-ranking officials through the streets of [[Moscow]] to the [[Kremlin]] where, in a lavish ceremony, he was awarded the highest Soviet honour, the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], by the Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]].<ref>{{cite book|title=108 минут, изменившие мир|author=Антон Первушин|chapter=Гражданин мира|date=2011|publisher=Эксмо|isbn=978-5-699-48001-2}} (Anton Pervushin. ''108 minutes which changed the world''; in Russian)</ref>

Nowadays the commemoration ceremony on Cosmonautics Day starts in the city of [[Korolyov (city)|Korolyov]], near Gagarin's statue. Participants then proceed under police escort to [[Red Square]] for a visit to Gagarin's grave in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]], and continue to [[Cosmonauts Alley]], near the [[Monument to the Conquerors of Space]]. Finally, the festivities conclude with a visit to the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In 1968, the 61st conference of the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] resolved to celebrate this day as the World Aviation and Astronautics Day.<ref name="RussianRadio" /><ref name="sputniknews" />

On 12 April 1981, exactly 20 years after ''Vostok 1'',  a [[Space Shuttle]] ([[STS-1]], ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'') was launched for the first orbital flight, although this was a coincidence as the launch of STS-1 had been delayed for two days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-1/mission-sts-1.html |title=STS-1 Overview |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>

On 7 April 2011, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted a resolution declaring 12 April as the International Day of Human Space Flight.<ref name="UN" />

In the 1960s the song ''14 минут до старта'' ("14 minutes until the launch") written by [[Oscar Feltsman]] and [[Vladimir Voynovich]] was considered the unofficial "anthem of cosmonautics" and regularly aired on this day in the USSR. In the 1980s it was eclipsed by the hit ''Trava u doma'' ("Grass at home") performed by the Russian [[VIA music|VIA]] band [[Zemlyane]] ("The Earthlings"). The latter song was awarded the official status of the anthem of Russian Cosmonautics in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=  http://www.vlg.aif.ru/culture/art/67131/ |title= Песня нашего земляка стала гимном российской космонавтики| date=31 March 2010 |accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> Russian cosmonauts have traditionally taken this song with them getting assigned for orbital deployments.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Since 2001, [[Yuri's Night]], also known as the "World’s Space party",<ref name=ynguardian>{{cite news |title=Darwin’s Day to Yuri’s Night: some science dates to remember |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/20/festive-science-dates |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 September 2014 |accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> is held every 12 April worldwide to commemorate milestones in space exploration.<ref name=wired20110214>

On 12 April 2017, the United Nations commemorated the "International Day of Human Space Flight" to celebrate the 56th anniversary of the first human space flight, which ushered in the beginning of the space era for mankind.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jatinder|first1=Kaur|title=UN Organizes International Day of Human Space Flight|url=http://abclive.in/un-organizes-international-day-human-space-flight/|accessdate=13 April 2017|agency=ABC News & Info Services|issue=Online|publisher=ABC Live}}</ref>
