'''Private spaceflight''' is flight beyond the [[Kármán line]] (above the nominal edge of space at {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} Earth [[altitude]])—or the [[new product development|development]] of new spaceflight technology—that is conducted and paid for by an entity other than a government agency.

In the early decades of the [[Space Age]], the government [[space agency|space agencies]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[United States]] pioneered [[space technology]] in collaboration with affiliated [[design bureau]]s in the USSR and [[private enterprise|private companies]] in the US, entirely funding both the development of new spaceflight technologies and the operational costs of spaceflight. The [[European Space Agency]] was formed in 1975, largely following the same model of space technology development.

Later on, large [[defense contractor]]s began to develop and operate space [[launch system]]s, derived from government rockets. Private spaceflight in Earth orbit includes [[communications satellite]]s, [[satellite television]], [[satellite radio]], [[Human spaceflight|astronaut transport]] and [[sub-orbital]] and orbital [[space tourism]].

In a 2012 article by [[Bloomberg News]], author Michael Burgan asserted that there is a "grand tradition of private wealth furthering advances in rocketry and space exploration" dating back to the early rocketry experiments of [[Robert Goddard]].<ref name="bb20120718">{{cite news |last=Burgan |first=Michael |title=Private Space Exploration a Long and Thriving Tradition |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-18/private-space-exploration-a-long-and-thriving-tradition.html |accessdate=20 July 2012 |agency=Bloomberg News |date=18 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719004230/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-18/private-space-exploration-a-long-and-thriving-tradition.html |archivedate=19 July 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Despite those earlier private undertakings, during the principal period of [[spaceflight]] in the mid-twentieth century, only [[nation state]]s developed and flew spacecraft above the [[Kármán line]], the nominal boundary of space.  Spaceflight was thus the [[monopoly]] province of a small group of national governments.

Both the [[NASA|U.S. civilian space program]] and [[Soviet space program]] were operated using mainly military pilots as [[astronaut]]s. During this period, no commercial space launches were available to private operators, and no private organization was able to offer space launches. Eventually, private organizations were able to both offer and purchase space launches, thus beginning the period of private spaceflight.

The first phase of private space operation was the launch of the first commercial [[communications satellite]]s. The U.S. [[Communications Satellite Act of 1962]] opened the way to commercial consortia owning and operating their own satellites, although these were still launched on state-owned launch vehicles.

In 1980, the [[European Space Agency]] created [[Arianespace]], a company to be operated commercially after initial hardware and launch facilities were developed with [[European Government|government]] funding.<ref name="stAriane20130301">{{cite news|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/via/satellitegetspersonal/Launch-Market-on-Cusp-of-Change_40648.html|title=Launch Market on Cusp of Change|last=Engel|first=Max|date=1 March 2013<!-- this is the PUBLICATION date of the newsstand issue; it came online on the internet by 15 Feb, but its stated date is 1 March 2013 -->|newspaper=Satellite Today|accessdate=15 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218050904/http://www.satellitetoday.com/via/satellitegetspersonal/Launch-Market-on-Cusp-of-Change_40648.html|archivedate=18 February 2013|deadurl=no|quote=''Although some governments funded vehicle development in different ways, there were no vehicles that were not the product of some form of fairly direct governmental support.

The history of full private space transportation includes early efforts by [[Germany|German]] company [[OTRAG]] in the 20th century, and numerous modern orbital and suborbital launch systems in the 21st century. More recent commercial spaceflight projects include the suborbital flights of [[Virgin Galactic]] and [[Blue Origin]], the orbital flights of [[SpaceX]] and other [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services|COTS]] participants.

Development of alternatives to government-provided [[space launch]] services began in earnest in the 2000s.  Private interests began funding limited development programs, but the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] later sponsored a [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services|series of]] [[Commercial Crew Development|programs]] to incentivize and encourage private companies to begin offering both cargo, and later, crew [[space transport]]ation services.

Lower prices for launch services after 2010, and published prices for standard launch services, have brought about significant [[space launch market competition]] that had not been present previously.<ref name="vance2015">{{cite book|title=Elon Musk : Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future|last1=Vance|first1=Ashlee|date=2015|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-230123-9|location=New York|page=15}}</ref><ref name="bbc20141203">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30251863|title=Europe to press ahead with Ariane 6 rocket|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715063455/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30251863|archivedate=15 July 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="fp20131209">{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/12/02/the_rocketeer_elon_musk|title=The Rocketeer|last=Belfiore|first=Michael|date=9 December 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|accessdate=11 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210233009/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/12/02/the_rocketeer_elon_musk|archivedate=10 December 2013|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="wsj20150917">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-rocket-supplier-looks-to-break-short-leash-1437339519|title=U.S. Rocket Supplier Looks to Break 'Short Leash'|last1=Pasztor|first1=Andy|date=17 September 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016131431/http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-rocket-supplier-looks-to-break-short-leash-1437339519|archivedate=16 October 2015|deadurl=no|quote='' The aerospace giants [Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp.] shared almost $500 million in equity profits from the rocket-making venture last year, when it still had a monopoly on the business of blasting the Pentagon's most important satellites into orbit.

=== American deregulation ===
{{POV check|section|date=January 2016}}
The [[Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984]] required encouragement of commercial space ventures, adding a new clause to NASA's [[mission statement]]:
:(c) Commercial Use of Space.--Congress declares that the general welfare of the United States requires that the Administration seek and encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the fullest commercial use of space.

Yet one of NASA's early actions was to effectively ban private space flight through a mountain of red tape. From the beginning, though, this met significant opposition not only by the private sector, but in Congress. In 1962, Congress passed its first law pushing back the prohibition on private involvement in space, the [[Communications Satellite Act of 1962]]. While largely focusing on the satellites of its namesake, this was described by both the law's opponents ''and'' advocates of private space, as the first step on the road to privatization.

While launch vehicles were originally bought from private contractors, from the beginning of the Shuttle program until the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]] disaster in 1986, NASA attempted to position its shuttle as the sole legal space launch option.<ref name="uscbo19861001">{{cite web |title=Setting Space Transportation Policy for the 1990s |date=1 October 1986 |publisher=US Congression Budget Office |url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/59xx/doc5935/doc24c-Entire.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=14 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213085324/http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/59xx/doc5935/doc24c-Entire.pdf |archivedate=13 February 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>
But with the mid-launch explosion/loss of [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]] came the suspension of the [[Federal government of the United States|government]]-operated shuttle flights, allowing the formation of a commercial launch industry.<ref name="bromberg1999">{{cite book |last=Bromberg |first=Joan Lisa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UebVg1YqsoC&pg=PA186|title=NASA and the Space Industry |year=1999 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6532-9|page=186|quote=''On the other hand, NASA resisted the buildup of a commercial launch industry. Launching was for many years an enterprise that was run by a de facto partnership of NASA and the companies from which NASA bought launchers and launch services. NASA proposed to put an end to that enterprise in the 1980s; it sought to enthrone the shuttle as the nation's commercial, as well as government, launcher. The prospect of erecting a private sector launch industry alongside the NASA shuttle was discussed, but it did not become a reality because the shuttle was too tough a competitor for private vehicles. Only the grounding of the shuttle after the Challenger accident allowed the commercial launch industry to get started.''}}</ref>

On 30 October 1984, US President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed into law the [[Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984|Commercial Space Launch Act]].<ref name="csla1984">{{cite web |title=Statement on Signing the Commercial Space Launch Act |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1984/103084i.htm |publisher=reagan.utexas.edu |accessdate=14 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927081605/http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1984/103084i.htm |archivedate=27 September 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> This enabled an American industry of private operators of [[expendable launch system]]s. Prior to the signing of this law, all commercial satellite launches in the United States were restricted by Federal regulation to NASA's [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]].

On 5 November 1990, United States President [[George H. W. Bush]] signed into law the [[Launch Services Purchase Act of 1990|Launch Services Purchase Act]].<ref>{{cite web |title=$ 2465d. Requirement of US Federal government to procure commercial launch services |url=http://www.space-frontier.org/commercialspace/lspalaw.txt |publisher=space-frontier.org |accessdate=14 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082111/http://www.space-frontier.org/commercialspace/lspalaw.txt |archivedate=4 February 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Act, in a complete reversal of the earlier Space Shuttle monopoly, ordered NASA to purchase launch services for its primary payloads from commercial providers whenever such services are required in the course of its activities.

In 1996 the United States government selected [[Lockheed Martin]] and [[Boeing]] to each develop [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]]s (EELV) to compete for launch contracts and provide assured access to space. The government's acquisition strategy relied on the strong commercial viability of both vehicles to lower unit costs. This anticipated market demand did not materialize, but both the [[Delta IV rocket|Delta IV]] and [[Atlas V]] EELVs remain in active service.

Commercial launches outnumbered government launches at the [[Eastern Range]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9790&page=1 |title=Streamlining Space Launch Range Safety - Executive Summary |publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref>

The [[Commercial Space Act of 1998|Commercial Space Act]] was passed in 1998 and implements many of the provisions of the [[Launch Services Purchase Act of 1990]].<ref name="usg19981028">{{cite news |title=Public Law 105-303: Commercial Space Act of 1998 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ogc/commercial/CommercialSpaceActof1998.html |accessdate=25 December 2014 |work=NASA Office of the General Counsel - Reference |publisher=NASA |date=28 October 1998 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202023518/http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ogc/commercial/CommercialSpaceActof1998.html |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Nonetheless, until 2004 NASA kept private space flight effectively illegal.<ref>[http://www.asi.org/adb/j/02/legal-roadblocks.html It's illegal for private enterprise to go into space.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990218062255/http://www.asi.org/adb/j/02/legal-roadblocks.html |date=1999-02-18 }}<br/> U.S. law regulates private space launches, and the current law is quite unreasonable. A private company wanting to build and launch a rocket faces a mountain of red tape and very long lead times for getting approval from the government. However, although these problems add a tremendous amount of cost to private space launches, there are no laws that prohibit private space launches.</ref> But that year, the [[Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004]] required that NASA and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] legalize private space flight.<ref name=nbc2004>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6682611/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/private-spaceflight-bill-signed-law/ Private Spaceflight Bill Signed into Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231001919/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6682611/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/private-spaceflight-bill-signed-law/ |date=31 December 2014 }}<br/>The Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act, or H.R. 5382, placed a clear legislative stamp on regulations that were being formulated by the Federal Aviation Administration. Among other provisions, the law was intended to let paying passengers fly on suborbital launch vehicles at their own risk.</ref>
The 2004 Act also specified a "learning period" which restricted the ability of the FAA to enact regulations regarding the safety of people who might actually fly on commercial spacecraft through 2012, ostensibly because spaceflight participants would share the risk of flight through [[informed consent]] procedures of human spaceflight risks, while requiring the launch provider to be legally liable for potential losses to uninvolved persons and structures.<ref name=tsr20150526/>

To the end of 2014, commercial passenger flights in space has remained effectively illegal, as the FAA has refused to give a commercial operator's license to any private space company.<ref>[http://www.jaunted.com/story/2014/1/29/17284/7200/travel/Wow.+FAA+Paperwork+Delays+May+Block+Virgin+Galactic+Debut.

Without a commercial operator's license, it's illegal for anyone - including Virgin's billionaire owner Richard Branson - to be a passenger on space planes. Think about this for a second: the private sector will have created a plane that glides through space, just over a century after heavier than air flight was even invented, but the scolds at the FAA need extra time to fill out their paperwork. Until then, apparently, the future can't happen.</ref>

In 1992, Resurs-500 capsule containing gifts was launched from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] in what was a private spaceflight called [[Space Flight Europe-America 500|Europe-America 500]]. The flight was conceived by the Russian [[Foundation for Social Inventions]] and [[Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center|TsSKB-Progress]], a Russian rocket-building company, to increase trade between Russia and USA, and promote use of technology once reserved only for military forces. Money for the launch was raised from a collection of Russian companies. The capsule parachuted into the Pacific Ocean and was brought to Seattle by a Russian missile-tracking ship.

The Russian government sold part of its stake in [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RSC Energia]] to private investors in 1994. Energia together with Khrunichev constituted most of the Russian manned space program. In 1997, the Russian government sold off enough of its share to lose the majority position.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}<!-- need a source for these claims; plus this section needs an update to capture the Russian renationalization of the space industry after 2014, see the [[United Rocket and Space Corporation]] article which was created in 2014 for more information -->{{update after|2014|12|25}}

=== Launch alliances ===

Since 1995 Khrunichev's [[Proton rocket]] is marketed through [[International Launch Services]] while the [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]] is marketed via [[Starsem]]. The [[Sea Launch]] project flies the Ukrainian [[Zenit rocket]].

In 2003 Arianespace joined with [[Boeing]] Launch Services and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] to create the [[Launch Services Alliance]]. In 2005, continued weak commercial demand for EELV launches drove Lockheed Martin and Boeing to propose a joint venture called the [[United Launch Alliance]] to service the United States government launch market.<ref>{{cite web |title=Boeing, Lockheed Martin to Form Launch Services Joint Venture |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=16790 |publisher=spaceref.com |accessdate=13 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209234346/http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=16790 |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Spaceflight privatization ===
Since the 1980s, various private initiatives have [[Startup company|started up]] to pursue the private use of [[outer space|space]]. The first privately funded rocket to achieve spaceflight was [[Conestoga (rocket)|Conestoga I]], which was launched by [[Space Services Inc.]] on a suborbital flight to {{convert|309|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude on 9 September 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceservicesinc.com/#!company-heritage/c1z05 |title=Heritage: Pioneering the Commercial Space Frontier |publisher=Space Services Inc. |accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150803174817/http://www.spaceservicesinc.com/#!company-heritage/c1z05 |archivedate=3 August 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/sites/matsland.htm |title=Matagorda Island |last=Wade |first=Mark |work=Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210032018/http://www.astronautix.com/sites/matsland.htm |archivedate=10 February 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In the early 2000s, several public-private partnerships were established in the United States to take advantage of [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] [[free enterprise|companies]] to accelerate spaceflight technology development and reduce the cost of access to space, both for cargo and passengers [[space transport|transport]]. In addition, several purely private initiatives have begun in the 2010s to develop various aspects of space technology such as [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program|reusable launch systems]] and private spaceflight endeavors to the [[inner solar system]].<ref name="iac">{{cite web |last1=Pittman |first1=Bruce |last2=Rasky |first2=Dan |last3=Harper |first3=Lynn |title=Infrastructure Based Exploration – An Affordable Path To Sustainable Space Development |url=https://cammpus.s3.amazonaws.com/resource/file/5351/IAC_Paper_Commercial_Space.pdf |publisher=IAC |accessdate=14 October 2014 |location=IAC - 12, D3, 2, 4, x14203 |year=2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026081409/https://cammpus.s3.amazonaws.com/resource/file/5351/IAC_Paper_Commercial_Space.pdf |archivedate=26 October 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 17 December 2003—on the 100th anniversary of the [[Wright brothers]] first powered flight of an [[aircraft]]—''[[SpaceShipOne]]'', an experimental [[spaceplane]] piloted by [[Brian Binnie]], [[SpaceShipOne flight 11P|made]] its first [[Rocket engine|rocket-powered]] flight, the first privately built craft to ever achieve supersonic flight.<ref name="belfiore2007">{{cite book |last1=Belfiore |first1=Michael |title=Rocketeers: how a visionary band of business leaders, engineers, and pilots is boldly privatizing space |date=2007 |publisher=Smithsonian Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-114903-0 |page= |pages=}}</ref>{{rp|8}}  The next year, ''SpaceShipOne'' made three suborbital flights into space, becoming the first privately built and operated vehicle to achieve manned spaceflight.

In 2006, NASA initiated a program to purchase commercial [[space transport|rides]] to carry cargo to the [[International Space Station]], while funding a portion of the development of new technology in a [[public-private partnership]], initially with {{USD|500 million}} of contracted development funds.<ref name=belfiore2007/>{{rp|10}}

On 1 February 2010, United States President [[Barack Obama]] [[Barack Obama space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center|proposed in a speech]] that NASA exit the business of flying astronauts from Earth to [[low-Earth orbit]]—the locus of human spaceflight ever since the last Lunar manned mission in 1972—and move it to private companies who contract with the [[Federal Government of the United States|government]] to provide [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services|cargo resupply]] services to the [[ISS]]. The proposal acted on the findings of the 2009 [[Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee|Augustine Commission]] and built on the success of the [[Commercial Resupply Services]] that outsourced American cargo delivery to the [[International Space Station]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Obama Calls for End to NASA’s Moon Program |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/science/space/02nasa.html |format=PDF |publisher=nytimes.com |accessdate=1 February 2010 |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2 February 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204033224/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/science/space/02nasa.html |archivedate=4 February 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>'

{{Main|List of private spaceflight companies}}

Today many commercial space transportation companies offer launch services to satellite companies and government space organizations around the world. In 2005 there were 18 total commercial launches and 37 non-commercial launches.

=== Funding ===
In recent years, the [[finance|funding]] to support private spaceflight has begun to be raised from a larger pool of sources than the relatively more limited sources of the 1990s. For example, {{asof|2013|06|lc=y}} and in the United States alone, ten [[billionaire]]s have made "serious investments in private spaceflight activities"<ref name=hc20130628/> at six companies, including [[Stratolaunch Systems]], [[Planetary Resources]], [[Blue Origin]], [[Virgin Galactic]], [[SpaceX]], and [[Bigelow Aerospace]]. The ten investors are [[Paul Allen]], [[Larry Page]], [[Eric E. Schmidt]], [[Ram Shriram]], [[Charles Simony]], [[Ross Perot, Jr.]], [[Jeff Bezos]], [[Richard Branson]], [[Elon Musk]], and [[Robert Bigelow]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Commercial launchers ===
{{Main|Space transport}}

The space transport business has, historically, had its primary customers in national governments and large commercial segments. Launches of government [[Payload (air and space craft)|payloads]], including military, civilian and scientific satellites, was the largest market segment in 2007 at nearly $100 billion a year. This segment is dominated by domestic favorites such as the [[United Launch Alliance]] for U.S. government payloads and [[Arianespace]] for European satellites. The commercial payload segment, valued at under $3 billion a year, was dominated by [[Arianespace]] in 2007, with over 50% of the market segment,<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Andy Pasztor |title=Changing Trajectory: French Firms Vaults Ahead in Civilian Rocket Market |journal=The Wall Street Journal |volume= |pages=A1 |date=25 June 2007 |publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc.}}</ref> followed by Russian launchers.

{{Main|Commercial Orbital Transportation Services}}

The [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] determined to begin a process to purchase [[Space launch|orbital launch]] services for cargo deliveries to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) beginning in the mid-2000s, rather than operate the launch and delivery services as they had with the [[Space Shuttle]], which was to retire in less than half a decade, and ultimately did retire in 2011.  On 18 January 2006, NASA announced an opportunity for US commercial providers to demonstrate orbital transportation services.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA Seeks Proposals for Crew and Cargo Transportation to Orbit |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18791 |publisher=spaceref.com |accessdate=11 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67WYLjVMb?url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18791 |archivedate=9 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> As of 2008, NASA planned to spend $500 million through 2010 to finance development of [[private sector]] capability to transport payloads to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).{{update after|2013|1|21}} This was considered more challenging than then-available commercial space transportation because it would require precision [[orbit insertion]], [[in-orbit rendezvous|rendezvous]] and possibly docking with another spacecraft.

After it transpired that Rocketplane Kistler was failing to meet its contractual deadlines, NASA terminated its contract with the company in August 2008, after only $32 million had been spent. Several months later, in December 2008, NASA awarded the remaining $170 million in that contract to [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]] to develop resupply services to the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA Awards Space Station Commercial Resupply Services Contracts |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/dec/HQ_C08-069_ISS_Resupply.html |publisher=nasa.gov |accessdate=24 December 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715085914/http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/dec/HQ_C08-069_ISS_Resupply.html |archivedate=15 July 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Emerging personal spaceflight ===
{{Main|Space tourism}}

Before 2004, the year it was legalized in the US, no privately operated manned spaceflight had ever occurred. The only private individuals to journey to space went as [[space tourism|space tourists]] in the [[Space Shuttle]] or on Russian [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] flights to [[Mir]] or the [[International Space Station]].

All private individuals who flew to space before [[Dennis Tito]]'s self-financed International Space Station visit in 2001 had been sponsored by their home governments or by private corporations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sen.com/features/soyuz-tm-11-first-journalist-in-space |title=Soyuz TM-11: First journalist in space |publisher=SEN.com |author=Anatoly Zak |date=27 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005021101/http://sen.com/features/soyuz-tm-11-first-journalist-in-space |archivedate=5 October 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Those trips include US Congressman [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson's]] January 1986 flight on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] and Japanese television reporter [[Toyohiro Akiyama]]'s 1990 flight to the [[Mir]] Space Station.

The [[Ansari X PRIZE]] was intended to stimulate private investment in the development of spaceflight technologies. 21 June 2004, test flight of [[SpaceShipOne]], a contender for the X PRIZE, was the first [[human spaceflight]] in a privately developed and operated vehicle.

On 27 September 2004, following the success of SpaceShipOne, [[Richard Branson]], owner of [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and [[Burt Rutan]], SpaceShipOne's designer, announced that [[Virgin Galactic]] had licensed the craft's technology, and were planning commercial space flights in 2.5 to 3 years. A fleet of five craft ([[SpaceShipTwo]], launched from the [[WhiteKnightTwo]] carrier airplane) were to be constructed, and flights would be offered at around $200,000 each, although Branson said he planned to use this money to make flights more affordable in the long term. A test flight of SpaceShipTwo crashed in October 2014.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |last2=Schwartz |first2=John |title=Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo Crashes in New Setback for Commercial Spaceflight |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/science/virgin-galactics-spaceshiptwo-crashes-during-test-flight.html |date=31 October 2014 |work=New York Times |accessdate=20 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216054401/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/science/virgin-galactics-spaceshiptwo-crashes-during-test-flight.html |archivedate=16 December 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[Copenhagen Suborbitals]] is a crowd funded amateur manned space programme. {{As of|2016}} it has flown four home-built rockets and two mock-up space capsules.

== Plans ==

Many have speculated on where private spaceflight may go in the near future. Numerous projects of orbital and suborbital launch systems for satellites and manned flights exist. Some orbital manned missions would be state-sponsored like most COTS participants. (that develop their own launch systems). Another possibility is for paid suborbital tourism on craft like those from [[Virgin Galactic]], [[Space Adventures]], [[XCOR Aerospace]], [[RocketShip Tours]], [[ARCASPACE]], [[PlanetSpace]]-[[Canadian Arrow]], British [[Starchaser Industries]] or non-commercial like [[Copenhagen Suborbitals]]. Additionally, suborbital spacecraft have applications for faster intercontinental package delivery and passenger flight.

Some have speculated on the profitability of [[mining]] [[metal]] from [[asteroids]]. According to some estimates, a one kilometer-diameter asteroid would contain 30 million tons of nickel, 1.5 million tons of metal [[cobalt]] and 7,500tons of [[platinum]]; the platinum alone would have a value of more than $150 billion at 2008 terrestrial prices.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Asteroid Mining Will Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/asteroid-mining1.htm |publisher=howstuffworks.com |accessdate=12 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210094619/http://science.howstuffworks.com/asteroid-mining1.htm |archivedate=10 February 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

{{Main|Space elevator}}

A [[space elevator]] system is a possible launch system, currently under investigation by at least one private venture.<ref>{{cite web |title=The LiftPort Space Elevator |url=http://www.liftport.com/ |publisher=liftport.com |accessdate=11 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212031628/http://www.liftport.com/ |archivedate=12 February 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are concerns over cost, general feasibility and some political issues. On the plus side the potential to scale the system to accommodate traffic would (in theory) be greater than some other alternatives. Some factions contend that a space elevator &mdash; if successful &mdash; would not supplant existing launch solutions but complement them.

== Non-launched efforts ==

=== Failed spaceflight ventures ===
After earlier first effort of [[OTRAG]], in the 1990s the projection of a significant demand for [[communications satellite]] launches attracted the development of a number of commercial space launch providers. The launch demand largely vanished when some of the largest satellite constellations, such as 288 satellite [[Teledesic]] network, were never built.

In 1996 [[NASA]] selected [[Lockheed Martin]] [[Skunk Works]] to build the X-33 [[VentureStar]] prototype for a single stage to orbit ([[SSTO]]) [[reusable launch vehicle]]. In 1999, the subscale X-33 prototype's composite liquid hydrogen fuel tank failed during testing. At project termination on 31 March 2001, NASA had funded $912 million of this wedge shaped spacecraft while Lockheed Martin financed $357 million of it.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA Reaches Milestone in Space Launch Initiative Program |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/x-33/01-31.htm |publisher=NASA |accessdate=14 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805093450/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/x-33/01-31.htm |archivedate=5 August 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[VentureStar]] was to have been a full-scale commercial space transport operated by Lockheed Martin.

In February 2013, the US nonprofit [[Inspiration Mars Foundation]] announced a plan to send a married couple on a 2018 mission to travel to Mars and back to Earth on a 501-day round trip, with no landing planned on Mars.<ref name="pm20130227">{{cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/moon-mars/the-crazy-plan-to-fly-two-humans-to-mars-in-2018-15152667|title=The Crazy Plan to Fly Two Humans to Mars in 2018|last=Belfiore|first=Michael|date=27 February 2013|newspaper=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=28 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302224710/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/moon-mars/the-crazy-plan-to-fly-two-humans-to-mars-in-2018-15152667|archivedate=2 March 2013|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
The mission will take advantage of an infrequently occurring [[free return trajectory]]—a unique orbit opportunity which occurs only once every fifteen years—and will allow the [[space capsule]] to use the smallest possible amount of [[rocket propellant|fuel]] to get it to Mars and back to Earth.
The two-person American crew – a man and a woman – will orbit around Mars at a distance of {{convert|100|mi|km}} of the surface.<ref name="awst20130304">{{cite news|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/AW_03_04_2013_p24-553876.xml|title=Serious Intent About 2018 Human Mars Mission|last=Morring|first=Frank, Jr.|date=4 March 2013|newspaper=Aviation Week and Space Technology|accessdate=7 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510095022/http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=%2Farticle-xml%2FAW_03_04_2013_p24-553876.xml|archivedate=10 May 2013|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
