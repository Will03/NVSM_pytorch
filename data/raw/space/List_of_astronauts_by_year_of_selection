<!---Only people selected as professional astronauts should be listed here-->
This is a '''list of [[astronaut]]s by year of selection''': people selected to train for a [[List of human spaceflight programs|human spaceflight program]] to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a [[spacecraft]]. Until recently, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. However, with the advent of [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital flight]] starting with privately funded [[SpaceShipOne]] in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the [[commercial astronaut]].

While the term astronaut is sometimes applied to anyone who trains for travels into space—including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists—this article lists only professional astronauts, those who have been selected to train as a profession. This includes national space programs and private industry programs which train and/or hire their own professional astronauts.

More than 500 people have trained as astronauts. A list of everyone who has flown in space can be found at ''[[List of space travelers by name]]''.

==1954–1958==
'''North American X-15 Pilots Group (USA)'''

:Fourteen pilots were directly involved with the [[North American X-15|X-15]], although only twelve actually flew the vehicles. There was no formal selection process, since everyone chosen was already a qualified test pilot.

:[[Scott Crossfield]] and [[Alvin White]] were the prime and backup North American Aviation test pilots who first became involved with the project. Air Force Captains [[Iven Kincheloe]] (prime pilot) and [[Robert Michael White|Robert White]] (backup) were assigned to the X-15 in 1957. When Kincheloe was killed in an accident through a different rocket aircraft program, White became prime pilot and Captain [[Robert Rushworth]] became his backup.The first NASA pilots were [[Joseph A. Walker|Joseph Walker]] and [[Neil Armstrong]]. Lieutenant Commander [[Forrest S. Petersen]] represented the Navy.

:Walker and Armstrong were eventually replaced by NASA pilots [[John B. McKay]] (1960), [[Milton Thompson]] (1963) and [[William H. Dana]] (1965). White and Rushworth were succeeded by Captain [[Joe Engle]] (1963), Captain [[William Joseph Knight]] (1964) and Major [[Michael J. Adams|Michael Adams]] (1966). The Navy selected Lieutenant [[Lloyd Hoover]] as Peterson's replacement, though he never trained or flew.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Whos-Who-Space-Michael-Cassutt/dp/0028649656|title=Who's Who in Space|last=Cassutt|first=Michael|date=November 1998|publisher=Macmillan Library Reference|isbn=9780028649658|edition= Subsequent |location=New York|language=English}}</ref>

'''June 25 – Man In Space Soonest (USA)'''

:[[Neil Armstrong]], [[Bill Bridgeman|William B. Bridgeman]], [[Scott Crossfield|Albert S. Crossfield]], [[Iven C. Kincheloe]], [[John B. McKay]], [[Robert A. Rushworth]], [[Joseph A. Walker]], [[Alvin S. White]], [[Robert M. White]]

:Nine test pilots from the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), [[North American Aviation]] (NAA), and [[Douglas Aircraft Corporation]] were selected for the [[Man In Space Soonest]] project, a USAF initiative to put a man in space before the [[Soviet Union]] did. The project was cancelled on August 1, but two of these men would later reach space: Walker made two [[X-15]] flights above 100 kilometers in 1963; and Neil Armstrong joined [[NASA]] in 1962 and flew in [[Project Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]], becoming the first human to set foot on the Moon at 02:56 [[Universal Coordinated Time|UTC]] July 21, 1969.<ref name="ALSJ 4">{{cite web | url = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html | title = Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal: One Small Step | author = Jones, Eric M.

==1959==
'''April 9 – [[Mercury Seven|NASA Group 1]] – ''Mercury Seven'' (USA)'''

:[[Scott Carpenter]], [[Gordon Cooper]], [[John Glenn]], [[Virgil Grissom|Gus Grissom]], [[Wally Schirra]], [[Alan Shepard]] and [[Deke Slayton]].

:The first group of astronauts selected by [[NASA]] were for [[Project Mercury]] in April 1959. All seven were military test pilots, a requirement specified by President [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] to simplify the selection process. All seven eventually flew in space, although one, Deke Slayton, did not fly a Mercury mission due to a medical disqualification, instead flying a decade later on the [[Apollo-Soyuz|Apollo-Soyuz mission]]. The other six each flew one Mercury mission. For two of these, Scott Carpenter and John Glenn, the Mercury mission was their only flight in the Mercury/[[Project Gemini|Gemini]]/[[Apollo Program|Apollo]] era. Glenn later flew on the [[STS-95|Space Shuttle]]. 
:Three of the Mercury astronauts, Gus Grissom, Gordon Cooper and Wally Schirra, also each flew a mission during the Gemini program. Alan Shepard was slated to fly [[Mercury 10]] before its cancellation and was the original commander for the [[Gemini 3]] mission, but did not fly due to a medical disqualification. After surgery to correct the problem, he later flew as commander of [[Apollo 14]]. He was the only Mercury astronaut to go to the Moon. 
:Wally Schirra was the only astronaut to fly into space on all three types of spacecraft, though Gus Grissom was scheduled to be first to complete that feat before he [[Apollo 1|died in a fire on Apollo 1]] during launchpad training. Gordon Cooper was a backup commander for [[Apollo 10]], the "dress rehearsal" flight for the lunar landing, and would have commanded another mission—likely to have been [[Apollo 13]], according to the crew rotation—but was bumped from the rotation after a disagreement with NASA management.

:Collectively, at least one member of the Mercury Seven flew on every NASA class of human-rated spacecraft (but neither the [[Skylab]] nor [[International Space Station|ISS]] space stations) through the end of the 20th century: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle.

==1960==
'''March 7 – Air Force Group 1 (USSR)'''

:[[Ivan Anikeyev]], [[Pavel Belyayev]], [[Valentin Bondarenko]], [[Valery Bykovsky]], [[Valentin Filatyev]], [[Yuri Gagarin]], [[Viktor Gorbatko]], [[Anatoli Kartashov]], [[Yevgeny Khrunov]], [[Vladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov|Vladimir Komarov]], [[Alexey Leonov]], [[Grigori Nelyubov]], [[Andrian Nikolayev]], [[Pavel Popovich]], [[Mars Rafikov]], [[Georgi Shonin]], [[Gherman Titov]], [[Valentin Varlamov]], [[Boris Volynov]], and [[Dmitri Zaikin]].

:The initial group of Soviet cosmonauts was chosen from Soviet Air Force jet pilots.

'''April – Dyna–Soar Group 1 (USA)'''

:[[Neil Armstrong]], [[William H. Dana]], [[Henry C. Gordon]], [[William J. Knight|Pete Knight]], [[Russell L. Rogers]], [[Milton O. Thompson|Milt Thompson]], and [[James W. Wood]].

:In April 1960, seven men were secretly chosen for the [[Dyna-Soar]] program. Armstrong had previously been part of the [[Man in space soonest|MISS]] program. Armstrong and Dana left the program in the summer of 1962.

==1962==
'''March 12 – Female Group (USSR)'''

:[[Tatyana Kuznetsova]], [[Valentina Ponomaryova]], [[Irina Solovyova]], [[Valentina Tereshkova]], and [[Zhanna Yorkina]].

:On March 12, 1962, a group of five civilian women with parachuting experience was added to the cosmonaut training program. Only Tereshkova would fly. A leading Soviet high-altitude parachutist, 20-year-old [[Tatyana Kuznetsova]] was, and remains, the youngest person ever selected to train for spaceflight.

'''September 17 – [[Astronaut Group 2|NASA Group 2]] – ''The Next Nine, aka'' ''The Nifty Nine'', ''The New Nine'' (USA)'''

:[[Neil Armstrong]], [[Frank Borman]], [[Pete Conrad]], [[Jim Lovell]], [[Jim McDivitt]], [[Elliot See]], [[Thomas Patten Stafford|Tom Stafford]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]].

:A [[Astronaut Group 2|second group]] of nine astronauts was selected by NASA in September 1962. All of this group flew missions in the [[Gemini program]] except Elliott See, who died in a flight accident while preparing for the [[Gemini 9]] flight. All of the others also flew on Apollo, except for Ed White, who died in the [[Apollo 1]] launchpad fire. 
:Three of this group, McDivitt, Borman and Armstrong, made single flights in both Gemini and Apollo.  Four others, Young, Lovell, Stafford and Conrad, each made two flights in Gemini and at least one flight in Apollo. Young and Lovell both made two Apollo flights. Conrad and Stafford also made second flights in Apollo spacecraft, Conrad on [[Skylab 2]] and Stafford in Apollo-Soyuz. 
:Six of this group, Borman, Lovell, Stafford, Young, Armstrong and Conrad, made flights to the Moon. Lovell and Young went to the Moon twice. Armstrong, Conrad, and Young walked on the Moon. McDivitt was later Apollo Program Director and became the first [[General|general officer]] and would have been either the prime LM Pilot or backup commander for [[Apollo 14]], but left NASA due to a conflict between Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton. John Young also later flew on the [[Space Shuttle]] ([[STS-1]] and [[STS-9]]) and would retire from NASA in 2004. He was both the first and last of his group to go into space.

'''September 19 – Dyna-Soar Group 2 (USA)'''

:On September 19, 1962, [[Albert H. Crews|Albert Crews]] was added to the Dyna-Soar program and the names of the six active Dyna-Soar astronauts were announced to the public.

Gordon, Jr.|Richard Gordon]], [[Russell Schweickart]], [[David Scott]], [[Clifton Williams]]

:While four members of Group 3 died in accidents before ever reaching space—Chaffee in the [[Apollo 1]] fire, Bassett, Freeman and Williams in crashes of NASA [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38]] [[jet trainers]]—the other ten all flew on the Apollo program. Aldrin, Bean, Cernan and Scott walked on the Moon. Five of them: Aldrin, Cernan, Collins, Gordon and Scott also flew missions during the Gemini program. Cernan would be the only astronaut from this group to fly to the Moon twice, being assigned to both [[Apollo 10]] and [[Apollo 17]], while Bean would command the [[Skylab 3]] mission.

==1964==

==1965==
'''June 1 – Journalist Group 1 (USSR)'''

:In 1965, three civilian journalists, [[Yaroslav Golovanov]], [[Yuri Letunov]], [[Mikhail Rebrov]], were selected for cosmonaut training in preparation for flight on a [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] mission. When the Voskhod program was canceled, Golovanov and Letunov were dismissed. Rebrov, on the other hand, stayed with the space program as a journalist until 1974.

'''June 1 – Medical Group 2 (USSR)'''

:Three physicians were selected for the long-duration [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] flights: [[Yevgeni Illyin]], [[Aleksandr Kiselyov]], [[Yuri Senkevich]]. All were subsequently canceled to make way for the Soviet Moon program and dismissed at the beginning of the following year.

'''June 28 – [[NASA Astronaut Group 4|NASA Group 4]] – ''The Scientists'' (USA)'''

:[[Owen Garriott]], [[Edward Gibson]], [[Duane Graveline]], [[Joseph Kerwin]], [[Curt Michel]], [[Harrison Schmitt]]

:Graveline and Michel left NASA without flying in space. Schmitt walked on the Moon with [[Apollo 17]]. Garriott, Gibson and Kerwin all flew to Skylab. Garriott also flew on [[Space Shuttle]] flight [[STS-9]], becoming the first [[Amateur radio]] operator (callsign W5LFL) to operate from orbit.

'''October 28 – Air Force Group 3 (USSR)'''

:Boris Belousov, [[Vladimir Degtyarov]], [[Anatoli Fyodorov]], [[Yuri Glazkov]], Vitali Grishchenko, Veygeni Khludeyev, [[Leonid Kizim]], [[Pyotr Klimuk]], Gennadi Kolesnikov, Aleksandr Kramarenko, Mikhail Lisun, Aleksandr Petrushenko, Vladimir Preobrazhensky, [[Valery Rozhdestvensky]], [[Gennadi Sarafanov]], Ansar Sharafutdinov, Vasili Shcheglov, Aleksandr Skvortsov, Eduard Stepanov, [[Valeri Voloshin]], [[Oleg Yakovlev (cosmonaut)|Oleg Yakovlev]], [[Vyacheslav Zudov]]

:This cosmonaut group was selected for participation in five separate [[Soyuz programme]]s that the USSR was running. These included military programs—with and without the [[Almaz]]/[[Salyut]] [[space station]]s—and two lunar programs, only one of which aimed at an actual lunar landing. In the end, only the orbital program and the space station program went ahead. Few of the cosmonauts from this group ever were given the chance to fly.

'''November – USAF MOL Group 1 (USA)'''

:[[Michael J. Adams]], [[Albert H. Crews]] Jr., [[John L. Finley]], [[Richard E. Lawyer]], [[Lachlan Macleay]], [[Francis G. Neubeck]], [[James M. Taylor]], [[Richard H. Truly]].

:This group was selected for training for the US Air Force's [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] program. Of this group, only Truly transferred to NASA after the cancellation of the MOL program and later flew on the Space Shuttle. In 1989, Truly became the first astronaut to be [[NASA Administrator]].

==1966==

Engle was the only NASA astronaut to have earned his astronaut wings before his selection. 
:Two of this group never flew into space: Givens was killed in a car accident in 1967, and Bull resigned from the Astronaut Corps in 1968 after discovering he had [[pulmonary disease]]. Engle, Lind, and McCandless were the only ones from this group who never flew an Apollo spacecraft; Brand, Haise, Lousma, Mattingly, and Weitz all flew both an Apollo and a Shuttle (though Haise only flew in the Approach and Landing Tests, not into space).

'''May 23 – Civilian Specialist Group 2 (USSR)'''

'''June – USAF MOL Group 3 (USA)'''

:[[James Abrahamson]], [[Robert Herres]], [[Robert Henry Lawrence Jr|Robert H. Lawrence Jr]], [[Donald H. Peterson|Donald Peterson]].

:This group was selected for training for the US Air Force's [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] program. Lawrence was the first [[African-American]] to be chosen as an astronaut, but was killed in a jet accident before the MOL program was canceled in 1969. Had Lawrence not died, he would have been, if accepted by NASA, the first African-American astronaut candidate, predating [[Guion Bluford]], [[Ronald McNair]] and [[Frederick D. Gregory|Frederick Gregory]] by nine years.  Peterson transferred to NASA in 1969 after the MOL cancellation and would fly on the [[Space Shuttle]].  Herres would later become the first [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] under the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]] in 1987.

Protchenko was removed from the squad for health reasons, Ivanov was killed in the crash of a [[MiG-27]] during test pilot training and Kadenyuk was removed from the squad over marital issues (but accepted back into the Cosmonaut Detachment in 1988). Vasyutin concealed a medical condition from doctors that resulted in his falling ill during the [[Soyuz T-14]]/ Salyut 7 EO-4 flight causing the premature termination of the mission 4 months early. This resulted in more stringent cosmonaut medical checks which Moskalenko and Saley failed.<ref>{{cite book|title=World Manned Cosmonautics - History, Equipment, People (Russian language)|author=Yuri M.

:Due to the long delay between the last [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] mission and the [[STS-1|first flight of the Space Shuttle]] in 1981, few astronauts from the older groups stayed with [[NASA]]—though some did, including [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]]. Thus, in 1978, a new group of 35 astronauts was selected after 9 years without new astronauts, including the first American female astronauts, and the first African-American astronauts to fly, [[Guion Bluford]] and [[Frederick D. Gregory]] (the first black astronaut was [[Robert Henry Lawrence Jr]]), as well as the first Asian-American, [[Ellison Onizuka]]. [[Robert L. Stewart|Bob Stewart]] was the first [[U.S. Army|Army]] astronaut to be selected (almost 19 years after the original [[Mercury Seven]]). Since then, a new group has been selected roughly every two years.

:Two different astronaut groups were formed: pilots and mission specialists. Additionally, the [[Space Shuttle program|Shuttle Program]] has payload specialists who are selected for a single mission and are not part of the astronaut corps—mostly scientists, with a few politicians, and many international astronauts.

:Of the first of the post-Apollo group, Sally Ride would become the first American woman in space ([[STS-7]]). Later, she would fly with Kathryn Sullivan on a Shuttle flight in which Sullivan would become the first American woman to perform an EVA. Dr. Thagard, who flew with Ride on STS-7, would later become the first American to be launched on a Russian rocket ([[Soyuz TM-21]] or "Mir-18") to the [[Mir]] space station, while Shannon Lucid would serve on the Mir for slightly over six months, breaking all American space duration records (both the [[Skylab 4]] record and Thagard's) from 1996-97 until [[Sunita Williams]], who was selected 20 years later, broke Lucid's record. 
:Of this group, Scobee, Resnik, Onizuka, and McNair would perish in the [[Challenger Disaster]]. Of the astronauts chosen, Anna Fisher remained on active duty the longest, retiring in 2017 (although her tenure included an extended leave of absence from 1989-1996), while Robert Gibson and Rhea Seddon became the first active duty astronauts to marry (both are now retired). Shannon Lucid's tenure was unbroken from 1978 until she announced her retirement in 2012. In later years she served as a space shuttle [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator .28CAPCOM.29|CAPCOM]], up to the final day of the final shuttle mission. After the Challenger Disaster, Sally Ride would serve on both the [[Rogers Commission]] and the [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]].

Both Jerry Ross and Chang-Diaz currently jointly hold the record of number of manned spaceflights flown, at seven. Charles Bolden was chosen in 2009 to become the second NASA astronaut and the first African-American to the post of [[NASA Administrator]] on a full-time basis (although Frederick Gregory, who is also African-American and a former Shuttle commander, held the post on a temporary basis between the departure of [[Sean O'Keefe]] and the appointment of [[Michael D. Griffin|Michael Griffin]] in 2005). The announcement, made a day before the conclusion of the [[STS-125]] flight to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], was coincidental, because Bolden was the pilot on the [[STS-31|telescope's deployment flight]] in 1990.
