'''The Fabric of Reality''' is a 1997 book by the physicist [[David Deutsch]]. The text was initially published on August 1, 1997 by [[Viking Adult]] and Deutsch wrote a follow-up book entitled ''[[The Beginning of Infinity]]'', which was published in 2011.

==Overview==
The book expands upon his views of [[quantum mechanics]] and its implications for understanding [[reality]]. This interpretation, which he calls the ''[[multiverse]]'' hypothesis, is one of a four-strand [[Theory of Everything]] (TOE).<ref name=io9 />

===The four strands===
#[[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]], "The first and most important of the four strands".
#[[Karl Popper]]'s [[epistemology]], especially its anti-[[inductivism]] and its requiring a [[scientific realism|realist]] (non-instrumental) interpretation of scientific theories, and its emphasis on taking seriously those bold conjectures that resist being [[Falsifiability|falsified]].
#[[Alan Turing]]'s [[theory of computation]], especially as developed in Deutsch's "Turing principle", where Turing's [[Universal Turing machine]] is replaced by Deutsch's [[Quantum Turing machine|universal quantum computer]]. ("''The'' theory of computation is now the quantum theory of computation.")
#[[Richard Dawkins]]'s refinement of [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolutionary theory and the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]], especially the ideas of replicator and [[meme]] as they integrate with [[Karl Popper|Popperian]] problem-solving (the [[Wiktionary:epistemological#Adjective|epistemological]] strand).

===Deutsch's TOE===
His theory of everything is (weakly) [[emergence|emergentist]] rather than [[reductionism|reductive]]. It aims not at the reduction of everything to [[particle physics]], but rather at mutual support among multiverse, computational, [[epistemological]], and evolutionary principles.

==Reception==
Critical reception has been generally positive.<ref name=io9>{{cite web|last1=Shankel|first1=Jason|title=David Deutsch's The Fabric of Reality connects the spookier elements of quantum mechanics|url=http://io9.com/5920830/david-deutschs-the-fabric-of-reality-connects-the-spookier-elements-of-quantum-mechanics?commerce_insets_disclosure=off|publisher=io9|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Macfie|first1=Alexander Lyon|title=The fabric of reality (review)|journal=Rethinking History: The Journal of Theory and Practice|date=20 March 2015|pages=1–9|doi=10.1080/13642529.2015.1022997|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13642529.2015.1022997|accessdate=2 September 2015|volume=19}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Whitaker|first1=Andrew|title=The Fabric of Reality (review)|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|date=2001|volume=32|issue=1|pages=137–141|doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(00)00032-0|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219800000320|accessdate=2 September 2015|bibcode=2001SHPMP..32..137W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=Huw|title=Reviewed Work: The Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|date=June 1999|volume=50|issue=2|pages=309–312|doi=10.1093/bjps/50.2.309|jstor=40072228}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a mixed review for ''The Fabric of Reality'', writing that it "is full of refreshingly oblique, provocative insights.
