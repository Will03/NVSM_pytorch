Accessed on 18 January 2010</ref> are artificially-created, controlled [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]]s located in environments inhospitable for humans, such as on the [[ocean floor]], in space or on another planet.

The logistics and difficulties inherent in such ventures have been heavily explored in [[science fiction]].

==In fiction==
Human outposts in other worlds are a common motif in science fiction, whether established and occupied solely by humans or in cooperation – or competition – with [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien species]].  The setting may be another planet, Earth-like or otherwise; or a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]] large enough to house a city.

==Reality: Scientific advances==
===Under sea===

[[NASA]] currently trains [[astronauts]] in an [[underwater habitat]], to simulate living and working in the [[International Space Station]]. They conduct scientific research on the human body and coral reefs, and build undersea structures to simulate space station assembly spacewalk tasks. The program is also being used to study how isolation affects human behaviour, to prepare for the first human outposts on the Moon and Mars.<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/06/030617082001.htm Astronaut Leads Aquanauts On Aquarius Undersea Mission]; June 17, 2003; ScienceDaily.

===Outer space===
The [[Salyut 1]] [[space station]] in [[low Earth orbit]] was the first human outpost in space.  The only current human outposts in space are the [[International Space Station]] and China's [[Tiangong-2]].

[[NanoRacks]], after finalizing its contract with NASA, and after winning NextSTEPs Phase II award, is now developing its concept Independence-1 (previously known as Ixion), the first 'outpost' in NanoRacks' Space Outpost Program, which would turn spent rocket tanks into a habitable living area, often known as a [[wet workshop]].

Planning and design for [[colonization of the Moon|Lunar]]<ref name="NASA goes lunar: Robot craft, human outpost plans (USA TODAY)" /><ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090225132353.htm Small Robots Can Prepare Lunar Surface For NASA Outpost]; Mar. 2, 2009; [[ScienceDaily]]</ref> and [[colonization of Mars|Martian]] outposts is underway.<ref name="Resource Utilization Concepts for MoonMars" />
