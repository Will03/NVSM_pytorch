'''Dark matter''' is a [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] form of [[matter]] that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the [[universe]], and about a quarter of [[Universe#Composition|its total energy density]]. The majority of dark matter is thought to be non-[[baryon]]ic in nature, possibly being composed of some as-yet undiscovered [[subatomic particle]]s.<ref group="note">A small portion of dark matter could be baryonic. See [[Baryonic dark matter]].</ref> Its presence is implied in a variety of [[astrophysical]] observations, including [[gravitation]]al effects that cannot be explained unless more matter is present than can be seen. For this reason, most experts think dark matter to be ubiquitous in the universe and to have had a strong influence on its structure and evolution. Dark matter is called dark because it does not appear to interact with observable [[electromagnetic radiation]], such as [[light]], and is thus invisible to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]], making it extremely difficult to detect using usual astronomical equipment.<ref name="CERN Dark Matter">{{cite web |url=http://home.cern/about/physics/dark-matter |title=Dark Matter |website=CERN Physics |date=20 January 2012}}</ref>

The primary evidence for dark matter is that calculations show that many [[galaxy|galaxies]] would fly apart instead of rotating, or would not have formed or move as they do, if they did not contain a large amount of unseen matter.<ref name="Siegfried">{{Cite news |last=Siegfried |first=T. |date=5 July 1999 |title=Hidden Space Dimensions May Permit Parallel Universes, Explain Cosmic Mysteries |url=http://www.physics.ucdavis.edu/~kaloper/siegfr.txt |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]}}</ref> Other lines of evidence include observations in [[gravitational lensing]],<ref name="Trimble 1987">{{cite journal |last=Trimble |first=V. |date=1987 |title=Existence and nature of dark matter in the universe |journal=[[Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume=25 |pages=425–472 |bibcode=1987ARA&A..25..425T |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.25.090187.002233 |url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt2hz008rs/qt2hz008rs.pdf}}</ref> from the [[cosmic microwave background]], from astronomical observations of the [[observable universe]]'s current structure, from the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of galaxies]], from mass location during [[galactic collision]]s,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/a-history-of-dark-matter | title=A history of dark matter| year=2017}}</ref> and from the motion of galaxies within [[galaxy cluster]]s.

Because dark matter has not yet been observed directly, if it exists, it must barely interact with ordinary [[baryonic]] matter and radiation, except through gravity. The primary candidate for dark matter is some new kind of [[elementary particle]] that has [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|not yet been discovered]], in particular, [[weakly-interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs), or [[gravitationally-interacting massive particles]] (GIMPs).<ref name="Copi 1995" /> Many experiments to directly detect and study dark matter particles are being actively undertaken, but none has yet succeeded.<ref name="bertone hooper silk" /> Dark matter is classified as cold, warm, or hot according to its [[velocity]] (more precisely, its [[Free streaming|free streaming length]]). Current models favor a [[cold dark matter]] scenario, in which [[structure formation|structures emerge]] by gradual accumulation of particles.

In 1933, Swiss astrophysicist [[Fritz Zwicky]], who studied [[groups and clusters of galaxies|galaxy clusters]] while working at the [[California Institute of Technology]], made a similar inference.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |authorlink=Fritz Zwicky |date=1933 |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |journal=[[Helvetica Physica Acta]] |volume=6 |pages=110–127 |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |authorlink=Fritz Zwicky |title=On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae |date=1937 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=86 |page=217 |bibcode=1937ApJ....86..217Z |doi=10.1086/143864}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Zwicky |first=F. |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |date=1933 |journal=Helvetica Physica Acta |volume=6 |pages=110–127}} See also {{Citation |last=Zwicky |first=F. |bibcode=1937ApJ....86..217Z |title=On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae |date=1937 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=86 |page=217 |doi=10.1086/143864}}</ref> Zwicky applied the [[virial theorem]] to the [[Coma Cluster]] and obtained evidence of unseen mass that he called ''dunkle Materie'' ('dark matter'). Zwicky estimated its mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and compared that to an estimate based on its brightness and number of galaxies. He estimated that the cluster had about 400 times more mass than was visually observable. The gravity effect of the visible galaxies was far too small for such fast orbits, thus mass must be hidden from view. Based on these conclusions, Zwicky inferred that some unseen matter provided the mass and associated gravitation attraction to hold the cluster together.

Further indications that the [[mass-to-light ratio]] was not unity came from measurements of galaxy rotation curves. In 1939, [[Horace W.

At the same time that Rubin and Ford were exploring optical rotation curves, radio astronomers were making use of new radio telescopes to map the 21&nbsp;cm line of atomic hydrogen in nearby galaxies. The radial distribution of interstellar atomic hydrogen ([[H I region|HI]]) often extends to much larger galactic radii than those accessible by optical studies, extending the sampling of rotation curves—and thus of the total mass distribution—to a new dynamical regime.

== Technical definition ==
{{see also|Friedmann equations}}
In standard cosmology, matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]], i.e., ''ρ ∝ a<sup>−3</sup>''. This is in contrast to radiation, which scales as the inverse fourth power of the scale factor '' ρ ∝ a<sup>−4</sup> '', and a [[cosmological constant]], which is independent of ''a''. These scalings can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a cubical box, doubling the length of the sides of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (''2<sup>3</sup>''). For radiation, the decrease in energy density is larger because an increase in scale factor causes a proportional [[redshift]]. A cosmological constant, as an intrinsic property of space, has a constant energy density regardless of the volume under consideration.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/Cosmology/Lectures.pdf|title=Cosmology: Part III Mathematical Tripos, Cambridge University|author=Daniel Baumann|page=21−22}}</ref><ref>[[Dark energy]] is a term often used nowadays as a substitute for cosmological constant. It is basically the same except that dark energy might depend on scale factor in some unknown way rather than necessarily being constant.</ref>

In principle, "dark matter" means all components of the universe that are not visible but still obey ''ρ ∝ a<sup>−3</sup>''. In practice, the term "dark matter" is often used to mean only the non-baryonic component of dark matter, i.e., excluding "[[missing baryon problem|missing baryons]]." Context will usually indicate which meaning is intended.

The arms of [[spiral galaxies]] rotate around the galactic center. The luminous mass density of a spiral galaxy decreases as one goes from the center to the outskirts. If luminous mass were all the matter, then we can model the galaxy as a point mass in the centre and test masses orbiting around it, similar to the [[Solar System]].<ref group="note">This is a consequence of the [[shell theorem]] and the observation that spiral galaxies are spherically symmetric to a large extent (in 2D).</ref> From [[Kepler's Second Law]], it is expected that the rotation velocities will decrease with distance from the center, similar to the Solar System. This is not observed.<ref>{{cite journal | author1=Corbelli E. |author2=Salucci, P. | title=The extended rotation curve and the dark matter halo of M33|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=2000|volume=311|issue=2|pages=441–447 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03075.x|arxiv = astro-ph/9909252 |bibcode = 2000MNRAS.311..441C }}</ref> Instead, the galaxy rotation curve remains flat as distance from the center increases.

If Kepler's laws are correct, then the obvious way to resolve this discrepancy is to conclude that the mass distribution in spiral galaxies is not similar to that of the Solar System. In particular, there is a lot of non-luminous matter (dark matter) in the outskirts of the galaxy.

=== Velocity dispersions ===
{{main|Velocity dispersion}}
Stars in bound systems must obey the [[virial theorem]]. The theorem, together with the measured velocity distribution, can be used to measure the mass distribution in a bound system, such as elliptical galaxies or globular clusters. With some exceptions, velocity dispersion estimates of elliptical galaxies<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Faber |first1=S. M. |last2=Jackson |first2=R. E. |date=1976 |title=Velocity dispersions and mass-to-light ratios for elliptical galaxies |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=204 |pages=668–683 |bibcode=1976ApJ...204..668F |doi=10.1086/154215}}</ref> do not match the predicted velocity dispersion from the observed mass distribution, even assuming complicated distributions of stellar orbits.<ref>{{citebook|last1=Binny|first1=James|last2=Merrifield|first2=Michael|date=1998|title=Galactic Astronomy|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=712-713}}</ref>

As with galaxy rotation curves, the obvious way to resolve the discrepancy is to postulate the existence of non-luminous matter.

=== Galaxy clusters ===
[[Galaxy clusters]] are particularly important for dark matter studies since their masses can be estimated in three independent ways:

* From the scatter in radial velocities of the galaxies within clusters
* From [[X-ray]]s emitted by hot gas in the clusters. From the X-ray energy spectrum and flux, the gas temperature and density can be estimated, hence giving the pressure; assuming pressure and gravity balance determines the cluster's mass profile. 
* [[Gravitational lens]]ing (usually of more distant galaxies) can measure cluster masses without relying on observations of dynamics (e.g., velocity).

Generally, these three methods are in reasonable agreement that dark matter outweighs visible matter by approximately 5 to 1.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cosmological Parameters from Clusters of Galaxies|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=49|issue=1|pages=409–470|doi=10.1146/annurev-astro-081710-102514|arxiv=1103.4829|bibcode=2011ARA&A..49..409A|year=2011|last1=Allen|first1=Steven W|last2=Evrard|first2=August E|last3=Mantz|first3=Adam B}}</ref>

=== Gravitational lensing ===

One of the consequences of [[general relativity]] is that massive objects (such as a [[galaxy cluster|cluster of galaxies]]) lying between a more distant source (such as a [[quasar]]) and an observer should act as a lens to bend the light from this source. The more massive an object, the more lensing is observed.

Strong lensing is the observed distortion of background galaxies into arcs when their light passes through such a gravitational lens. It has been observed around many distant clusters including [[Abell 1689]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=A.

[[Weak gravitational lensing]] investigates minute distortions of galaxies, using statistical analyses from vast [[redshift survey|galaxy surveys]]. By examining the apparent shear deformation of the adjacent background galaxies, the mean distribution of dark matter can be characterized.

=== Cosmic microwave background ===
{{Main|Cosmic microwave background}}
[[File:WMAP 2008 universe content.png|thumb|Estimated division of total energy in the universe into matter, dark matter and dark energy based on five years of WMAP data.<ref>{{cite web|title=Content of the Universe - Pie Chart |url=https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/080998/index.html |website=Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |accessdate=9 January 2018}}</ref>]]
Although both dark matter and ordinary matter are matter, they do not behave in the same way. In particular, in the early universe, ordinary matter was ionized and interacted strongly with radiation via [[Thomson scattering]]. Dark matter does not interact directly with radiation, but it does affect the CMB by its gravitational potential (mainly on large scales), and by its effects on the density and velocity of ordinary matter. Ordinary and dark matter perturbations, therefore, evolve differently with time and leave different imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

The cosmic microwave background is very close to a perfect blackbody but contains very small temperature anisotropies of a few parts in 100,000. A sky map of anisotropies can be decomposed into an angular power spectrum, which is observed to contain a series of acoustic peaks at near-equal spacing but different heights. 
The series of peaks can be predicted for any assumed set of cosmological parameters by modern computer codes such as CMBFast and CAMB, and matching theory to data, therefore, constrains cosmological parameters.<ref name="Wayne Hu">The details are technical. See {{citeweb|author=Wayne Hu|title=Intermediate Guide to the Acoustic Peaks and Polarization|url=http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/intermediate.html|date=2001}} for an intermediate-level introduction.</ref> The first peak mostly shows the density of baryonic matter, while the third peak relates mostly to the density of dark matter, measuring the density of matter and the density of atoms.<ref name="Wayne Hu" />

The CMB anisotropy was first discovered by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, though this had too coarse resolution to detect the acoustic peaks. 
After the discovery of the first acoustic peak by the balloon-borne [[BOOMERanG]] experiment in 2000, 
the power spectrum was precisely observed by [[WMAP]] in 2003-12, and even more precisely 
by the [[Planck spacecraft]] in 2013-15. The results support the Lambda-CDM model.<ref name="Hinshaw2009">{{Cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=G. |display-authors=etal |year=2009 |title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement]] |volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=225–245 |arxiv=0803.0732 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225}}</ref><ref name="Planck15" />

=== Structure formation ===
{{Main|Structure formation}}
[[File:COSMOS 3D dark matter map.png|thumb|Mass map|3D map of the large-scale distribution of dark matter, reconstructed from measurements of [[weak gravitational lensing]] with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].<ref>{{Cite press |date=7 January 2007 |title=Hubble Maps the Cosmic Web of "Clumpy" Dark Matter in 3-D |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/01/image/a/grav |publisher=[[NASA]]}}</ref>]]

Structure formation refers to the period after the Big Bang when density perturbations collapsed to form stars, galaxies, and clusters. Prior to structure formation, the [[FRW metric|Friedmann solutions]] to general relativity describe a homogeneous universe. Later, small anisotropies gradually grew and condensed the homogeneous universe into stars, galaxies and larger structures. Ordinary matter is affected by radiation, which is the dominant element of the universe at very early times. As a result, its density perturbations are washed out and unable to condense into structure.<ref name="Jaffe">{{citeweb|author=A. H. Jaffe|title=Cosmology 2012: Lecture Notes|url=http://astro.imperial.ac.uk/sites/default/files/cosmology.pdf}}</ref> If there were only ordinary matter in the universe, there would not have been enough time for density perturbations to grow into the galaxies and clusters currently seen.

Dark matter provides a solution to this problem because it is unaffected by radiation. Therefore, its density perturbations can grow first. The resulting gravitational potential acts as an attractive [[potential well]] for ordinary matter collapsing later, speeding up the structure formation process.<ref name="Jaffe" /><ref>{{citejournal|title="Constraints on the composite photon theory|author=L.

=== Bullet Cluster ===
{{Main|Bullet Cluster}}
If dark matter does not exist, then the next most likely explanation is that general relativity—the prevailing theory of gravity—is incorrect and must be modified. The Bullet Cluster, the result of a recent collision of two galaxy clusters, provides a challenge for modified gravity theories because its apparent center of mass is far displaced from the baryonic center of mass.<ref>{{cite journal

=== Sky surveys and baryon acoustic oscillations ===
{{Main|Baryon acoustic oscillations}}

Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are fluctuations in the density of the visible [[baryonic]] matter (normal matter) of the universe on large scales. These are predicted to arise in the Lambda-CDM model due to acoustic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid of the early universe, and can be observed in the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum. BAOs set up a preferred length scale for baryons. As the dark matter and baryons clumped together after recombination, the effect is much weaker in the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe, but is detectable as a subtle (~ 1 percent) preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147 Mpc, compared to those separated by 130 or 160 Mpc. This feature was predicted theoretically in the 1990s and then discovered in 2005, in two large galaxy redshift surveys, the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] and the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].<ref>

=== Redshift-space distortions ===
Large galaxy [[redshift survey]]s may be used to make a three-dimensional map of the galaxy distribution. These maps are slightly distorted because distances are estimated from observed [[redshift]]s; the redshift contains a contribution from the galaxy's so-called peculiar velocity in addition to the dominant Hubble expansion term. On average, superclusters are expanding but more slowly than the cosmic mean due to their gravity, while voids are expanding faster than average. In a redshift map, galaxies in front of a supercluster have excess radial velocities towards it and have redshifts slightly higher than their distance would imply, while galaxies behind the supercluster have redshifts slightly low for their distance. This effect causes superclusters to appear squashed in the radial direction, and likewise voids are stretched. Their angular positions are unaffected.
The effect is not detectable for any one structure since the true shape is not known, but can be measured by averaging over many structures assuming Earth is not at a special location in the Universe.

The effect was predicted quantitatively by Nick Kaiser in 1987, and first decisively measured in 2001 by the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peacock |first1=J. |title=A measurement of the cosmological mass density from clustering in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey |journal=Nature |year=2001 |volume=410 |issue=6825 |pages=169–73 |arxiv=astro-ph/0103143 |bibcode=2001Natur.410..169P |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1038/35065528 |pmid=11242069}}</ref> Results are in agreement with the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

Dark matter can refer to any substance that interacts predominantly via gravity with visible matter (e.g., stars and planets). Hence in principle it need not be composed of a new type of fundamental particle but could, at least in part, be made up of standard baryonic matter, such as protons or neutrons.{{refn|name=BaryonicFootnote01|group=note|Astronomers define the term [[baryonic matter]] to refer to ordinary matter made of [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[electron]]s, including [[neutron stars]] and [[black holes]] from the collapse of ordinary matter.  Strictly speaking, electrons are [[lepton]]s not [[baryon]]s; but since their number is equal to the protons while their mass is far smaller, electrons give a negligible contribution to the average density of baryonic matter. Baryonic matter excludes other known particles such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrinos]]. Hypothetical primordial black holes are also generally defined as non-baryonic, since they would have formed from radiation, not matter.<ref name=BaryonicSource01>{{cite web |url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/B/Baryonic+Matter |title=Baryonic Matter |website=COSMOS - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy |publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]]|access-date=9 April 2018 }}</ref>}} However, for the reasons outlined below, most scientists think the dark matter is dominated by a non-baryonic component, which is likely composed of a currently unknown fundamental particle (or similar exotic state).

[[File:Fermi Observations of Dwarf Galaxies Provide New Insights on Dark Matter.ogv|thumb|[[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi-LAT]] observations of dwarf galaxies provide new insights on dark matter.]]

=== Baryonic matter ===
{{Distinguish|Missing baryon problem}}
[[Baryon]]s ([[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) make up ordinary stars and planets. However, baryonic matter also encompasses less common [[black hole]]s, [[neutron star]]s, faint old [[white dwarf]]s and [[brown dwarf]]s, collectively known as [[massive compact halo object]]s (MACHOs), which can be hard to detect.{{sfn|Randall|2015|p=286}}

However, multiple lines of evidence suggest the majority of dark matter is not made of baryons:

* Sufficient diffuse, baryonic gas or dust would be visible when backlit by stars. 
* The theory of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predicts the observed [[abundance of the chemical elements]]. If there are more baryons, then there should also be more helium, lithium and heavier elements synthesized during the Big Bang.<ref>Achim Weiss, "[http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/BBN Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Cooking up the first light elements]" in: Einstein Online Vol. 2 (2006), 1017</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Raine |first=D. |last2=Thomas |first2=T. |date=2001 |title=An Introduction to the Science of Cosmology |page=30 |publisher=[[IOP Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7503-0405-4 |oclc=864166846 }}</ref> Agreement with observed abundances requires that baryonic matter makes up between 4–5% of the universe's [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]].

=== Non-baryonic matter ===

Candidates for non-baryonic dark matter are hypothetical particles such as [[axion]]s, [[sterile neutrino]]s, [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs), [[gravitationally-interacting massive particles]] (GIMPs), or [[supersymmetric]] particles. The three neutrino types already observed are indeed abundant, and dark, and matter, but because their individual masses—however uncertain they may be—are almost certainly tiny, they can only supply a small fraction of dark matter, due to limits derived from [[Observable universe|large-scale structure]] and high-[[redshift]] galaxies.<ref name="bertone merritt" />

Unlike baryonic matter, nonbaryonic matter did not contribute to the formation of the [[Chemical element|elements]] in the early universe ([[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]])<ref name="Copi 1995" /> and so its presence is revealed only via its gravitational effects, or [[weak lensing]]. In addition, if the particles of which it is composed are supersymmetric, they can undergo [[annihilation]] interactions with themselves, possibly resulting in observable by-products such as [[gamma rays]] and neutrinos (indirect detection).<ref name="bertone merritt">{{Cite journal |last1=Bertone |first1=G. |last2=Merritt |first2=D. |title=Dark Matter Dynamics and Indirect Detection |year=2005 |journal=[[Modern Physics Letters A]] |volume=20 |issue=14 |pages=1021–1036 |arxiv=astro-ph/0504422 |bibcode=2005MPLA...20.1021B |doi=10.1142/S0217732305017391}}</ref>

===Dark matter aggregation and dense dark matter objects===
If dark matter is as common as observations suggest, an obvious question is whether it can form objects equivalent to [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, or [[black hole]]s. The answer has historically been that it cannot,<ref name="curio">http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/95-the-universe/galaxies/general-questions/508-are-there-any-dark-stars-or-dark-galaxies-made-of-dark-matter-advanced<br />{{cite journal |date=February 1, 2018 |title=Synopsis: A Way to Cool Dark Matter |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=120 |issue=5 |quote=One widely held belief about dark matter is that it cannot cool off by radiating energy. If it could, then it might bunch together and create compact objects in the same way that baryonic matter forms planets, stars, and galaxies. Observations so far suggest that dark matter doesn't do that—it resides only in diffuse halos ... As a result, it is extremely unlikely there are very dense objects like stars made out of entirely (or even mostly) dark matter.|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.051102 |pmid=29481169 |last1=Buckley |first1=Matthew R. |last2=Difranzo |first2=Anthony }}</ref><ref name="siegel">[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/10/28/why-doesnt-dark-matter-form-black-holes/#4e5014943de1 Why Doesn't Dark Matter Form Black Holes?] - Forbes column, authored by [https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethansiegel/#2f9e270c683e Ethan Siegel], whose Forbes biography identifies the author as a "Ph.D. astrophysicist, author, and science communicator, who professes physics and astronomy... numerous awards for science writing ... including the award for best science blog by the Institute of Physics.</ref> because of two factors:

* ''It lacks an efficient means to lose energy:''<ref name="curio" /> Ordinary matter forms dense objects because it has numerous ways to lose energy. Losing energy would be essential for object formation, because a particle that gains energy during compaction or falling "inward" under gravity, and cannot lose it any other way, will heat up and increase [[velocity]] and [[momentum]]. Dark matter appears to lack means to lose energy, simply because it is not capable of interacting strongly in other ways except through gravity. The [[Virial theorem]] suggests that such a particle would not stay bound to the gradually forming object—as the object began to form and compact, the dark matter particles within it would speed up and tend to escape.
* ''It lacks a range of interactions needed to form structures:''<ref name="siegel" /> Ordinary matter interacts in many different ways. This allow it to form more complex structures. For example, stars form through gravity, but the particles within them interact and can emit energy in the form of [[neutrino]]s and [[electromagnetic radiation]] through [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] when they become energetic enough. [[Proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can bind via the [[strong interaction]] and then form [[atom]]s with [[electron]]s largely through [[electromagnetic interaction]]. But there is no evidence that dark matter is capable of such a wide variety of interactions, since it only seems to interact through gravity and through some means no stronger than the [[weak interaction]] (although this is speculative until dark matter is better understood).

In 2015–2017 the idea that dense dark matter was composed of [[primordial black hole]]s, made a comeback<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Adrian |title=Is dark matter made of black holes? |journal=Science |date=9 February 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.aal0721}}</ref> following results of [[Gravitational wave|gravitation wave]] measurements which detected the merger of intermediate mass black holes. Black holes with about 30 solar masses are not predicted to form by either stellar collapse (typically less than 15 solar masses) or by the merger of black holes in galactic centers (millions or billions of solar masses). It was proposed that the intermediate mass black holes causing the detected merger formed in the hot dense early phase of the universe due to denser regions collapsing.  However this was later ruled out by a survey of about a thousand supernova which detected no gravitational lensing events, although about 8 would be expected if intermediate mass primordial black holes accounted for the majority of dark matter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://astronomy.com/news/2018/10/can-black-holes-explain-dark-matter  |title=Black holes can't explain dark matter. |publisher=astronomy.com |date=18 October 2018 |accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> The possibility that atom-sized primordial black holes account for a significant fraction of dark matter was ruled out by measurements of positron and electron fluxes outside the suns heliosphere by the Voyager 1 spacecraft. Tiny black holes are theorized to emit [[Hawking radiation]]. However the detected fluxes were too low and did not have the expected energy spectrum suggesting that tiny primordial black holes are not widespread enough to account for dark matter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/aging-voyager-1-spacecraft-undermines-idea-dark-matter-tiny-black-holes |publisher=sciencemag.org |date=9 January 2019 |accessdate=10 January 2019 |title=Aging Voyager 1 spacecraft undermines idea that dark matter is tiny black holes}}</ref> None-the-less research and theories proposing that dense dark matter account for dark matter continue as of 2018, including approaches to dark matter cooling,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2160305-there-could-be-entire-stars-and-planets-made-out-of-dark-matter/ | title=There could be entire stars and planets made out of dark matter}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.051102|pmid=29481169|title=Collapsed Dark Matter Structures|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=120|issue=5|pages=051102|year=2018|last1=Buckley|first1=Matthew R|last2=Difranzo|first2=Anthony|arxiv=1707.03829|bibcode=2018PhRvL.120e1102B}}</ref> and the question remains unsettled.

== Classification of dark matter: cold, warm or hot ==
Dark matter can be divided into ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' categories.<ref>{{cite book| first=Joseph |last=Silk|title=The Big Bang: Third Edition| chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XLwe1lUmz5kC| page=82}}| date=6 December 2000| publisher=Henry Holt and Company| isbn=978-0-8050-7256-3| chapter=IX}}</ref> These categories refer to velocity rather than an actual temperature, indicating how far corresponding objects moved due to random motions in the early universe, before they slowed due to cosmic expansion—this is an important distance called the [[free streaming]] length (FSL). Primordial density fluctuations smaller than this length get washed out as particles spread from overdense to underdense regions, while larger fluctuations are unaffected; therefore this length sets a minimum scale for later structure formation. The categories are set with respect to the size of a [[protogalaxy]] (an object that later evolves into a dwarf galaxy): dark matter particles are classified as cold, warm, or hot according to their FSL; much smaller (cold), similar to (warm), or much larger (hot) than a protogalaxy.<ref>{{Cite journal |first1=N. |last1=Vittorio |author2=J. Silk |date=1984 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=285 |pages=L39–L43 |title=Fine-scale anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in a universe dominated by cold dark matter |doi=10.1086/184361 |bibcode=1984ApJ...285L..39V}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |first1=Masayuki |last1=Umemura |author2=Satoru Ikeuchi |title=Formation of Subgalactic Objects within Two-Component Dark Matter |date=1985 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=299 |pages=583–592 |doi=10.1086/163726 |bibcode=1985ApJ...299..583U}}</ref>

Mixtures of the above are also possible: a theory of [[mixed dark matter]] was popular in the mid-1990s, but was rejected following the discovery of [[dark energy]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Cold dark matter leads to a bottom-up formation of structure with galaxies forming first and galaxy clusters at a latter stage, while hot dark matter would result in a top-down formation scenario with large matter aggregations forming early, later fragmenting into separate galaxies;{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} the latter is excluded by high-redshift galaxy observations.<ref name="bertone hooper silk" />

=== Alternative definitions ===
These categories also correspond to [[fluctuation spectrum]] effects and the interval following the Big Bang at which each type became non-relativistic. Davis ''et al.'' wrote in 1985:<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=M. |author2=Efstathiou, G. |author3=Frenk, C. S. |author4=White, S. D. M. |title=The evolution of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by cold dark matter |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=292 |date=May 15, 1985 |pages=371–394 |doi=10.1086/163168 |bibcode=1985ApJ...292..371D}}</ref>

{{quote|Candidate particles can be grouped into three categories on the basis of their effect on the [[Mixed dark matter|fluctuation spectrum]] (Bond ''et al.'' 1983). If the dark matter is composed of abundant light particles which remain relativistic until shortly before recombination, then it may be termed "hot". The best candidate for hot dark matter is a neutrino ... A second possibility is for the dark matter particles to interact more weakly than neutrinos, to be less abundant, and to have a mass of order 1&nbsp;keV. Such particles are termed "warm dark matter", because they have lower thermal velocities than massive neutrinos ... there are at present few candidate particles which fit this description. [[Gravitino]]s and [[photino]]s have been suggested (Pagels and Primack 1982; Bond, Szalay and Turner 1982) ... Any particles which became nonrelativistic very early, and so were able to diffuse a negligible distance, are termed "cold" dark matter (CDM). There are many candidates for CDM including supersymmetric particles. | M. Davis, G. Efstathiou, C. S. Frenk, and S. D. M. White | The evolution of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by cold dark matter}}

Another approximate dividing line is that warm dark matter became non-relativistic when the universe was approximately 1 year old and 1 millionth of its present size and in the [[radiation-dominated era]] (photons and neutrinos), with a photon temperature 2.7 million K. Standard physical cosmology gives the [[particle horizon]] size as 2''ct'' (speed of light multiplied by time) in the radiation-dominated era, thus 2 light-years. A region of this size would expand to 2 million light-years today (absent structure formation). The actual FSL is approximately 5 times the above length, since it continues to grow slowly as particle velocities decrease inversely with the scale factor after they become non-relativistic. In this example the FSL would correspond to 10 million light-years, or 3 mega[[parsec]]s, today, around the size containing an average large galaxy.

The 2.7 million K photon temperature gives a typical photon energy of 250 electron-volts, thereby setting a typical mass scale for warm dark matter: particles much more massive than this, such as GeV–TeV mass [[weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]], would become non-relativistic much earlier than one year after the Big Bang and thus have FSLs much smaller than a protogalaxy, making them cold. Conversely, much lighter particles, such as neutrinos with masses of only a few eV, have FSLs much larger than a protogalaxy, thus qualifying them as hot.

=== Cold dark matter ===
{{Main|Cold dark matter}}
[[Cold dark matter]] offers the simplest explanation for most cosmological observations. It is dark matter composed of constituents with an FSL much smaller than a protogalaxy. This is the focus for dark matter research, as hot dark matter does not seem capable of supporting galaxy or galaxy cluster formation, and most particle candidates slowed early.

The constituents of cold dark matter are unknown. Possibilities range from large objects like MACHOs (such as black holes<ref name=Hawkins>{{Cite journal |last1=Hawkins |first1=M. R.

The 1997 [[DAMA/NaI]] experiment and its successor [[DAMA/LIBRA]] in 2013, claimed to directly detect dark matter particles passing through the Earth, but many researchers remain skeptical, as negative results from similar experiments seem incompatible with the DAMA results.

Many [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] models offer dark matter candidates in the form of the WIMPy [[Lightest Supersymmetric Particle]] (LSP).<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Supersymmetric dark matter |journal=Physics Reports |date=1 March 1996 |pages=195–373 |volume=267 |issue=5–6 |doi=10.1016/0370-1573(95)00058-5 |first=Gerard |last=Jungman |first2=Marc |last2=Kamionkowski |first3=Kim |last3=Griest |arxiv=hep-ph/9506380 |bibcode=1996PhR...267..195J}}</ref> Separately, heavy sterile neutrinos exist in non-supersymmetric extensions to the [[Standard Model|standard model]] that explain the small [[neutrino]] mass through the [[seesaw mechanism]].

=== Warm dark matter ===
{{Main|Warm dark matter}}
[[Warm dark matter]] comprises particles with an FSL comparable to the size of a protogalaxy. Predictions based on warm dark matter are similar to those for cold dark matter on large scales, but with less small-scale density perturbations. This reduces the predicted abundance of dwarf galaxies and may lead to lower density of dark matter in the central parts of large galaxies. Some researchers consider this a better fit to observations. A challenge for this model is the lack of particle candidates with the required mass ~ 300 eV to 3000 eV.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

No known particles can be categorized as warm dark matter. A postulated candidate is the [[sterile neutrino]]: a heavier, slower form of neutrino that does not interact through the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], unlike other neutrinos. Some modified gravity theories, such as [[scalar–tensor–vector gravity]], require "warm" dark matter to make their equations work.

=== Hot dark matter ===
{{Main|Hot dark matter}}
[[Hot dark matter]] consists of particles whose FSL is much larger than the size of a protogalaxy. The [[neutrino]] qualifies as such particle. They were discovered independently, long before the hunt for dark matter: they were postulated in 1930, and [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment|detected in 1956]]. Neutrinos' [[Neutrino mass|mass]] is less than 10<sup>−6</sup> that of an [[electron]]. Neutrinos interact with normal matter only via gravity and the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], making them difficult to detect (the weak force only works over a small distance, thus a neutrino triggers a weak force event only if it hits a nucleus head-on). This makes them 'weakly interacting light particles' (WILPs), as opposed to WIMPs.

The three known [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavours]] of neutrinos are the ''electron'', ''muon'', and ''tau''. Their masses are slightly different. Neutrinos oscillate among the flavours as they move. It is hard to determine an exact [[Upper and lower bounds|upper bound]] on the collective average mass of the three neutrinos (or for any of the three individually). For example, if the average neutrino mass were over 50 ''eV/c''<sup>2</sup> (less than 10<sup>−5</sup> of the mass of an electron), the universe would collapse. CMB data and other methods indicate that their average mass probably does not exceed 0.3 ''eV/c''<sup>2</sup>. Thus, observed neutrinos cannot explain dark matter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/neutrinos.html |title=Neutrinos as Dark Matter |publisher=Astro.ucla.edu |date=21 September 1998 |accessdate=6 January 2011}}</ref>

Because galaxy-size density fluctuations get washed out by free-streaming, hot dark matter implies that the first objects that can form are huge [[supercluster]]-size pancakes, which then fragment into galaxies. [[List of deep fields|Deep-field observations]] show instead that galaxies formed first, followed by clusters and superclusters as galaxies clump together.

Although [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]] are popular search candidates,<ref name="bertone hooper silk" /> the [[Axion Dark Matter Experiment]] (ADMX) searches for [[axion]]s. Another candidate is heavy [[hidden sector]] particles that only interact with ordinary matter via gravity.

These experiments can be divided into two classes: direct detection experiments, which search for the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei within a detector; and indirect detection, which look for the products of dark matter particle annihilations or decays.<ref name="bertone merritt" />

=== Direct detection ===
{{details|Weakly interacting massive particles#Direct detection}}
Direct detection experiments aim to observe low-energy recoils (typically a few [[keV]]s) of nuclei induced by interactions with particles of dark matter, which (in theory) are passing through the Earth. After such a recoil the nucleus will emit energy in the form of [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] light or [[phonon]]s, as they pass through sensitive detection apparatus. To do this effectively, it is crucial to maintain a low background, and so such experiments operate deep underground to reduce the interference from [[cosmic ray]]s. Examples of underground laboratories with direct detection experiments include the [[Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory|Stawell mine]], the [[Soudan mine]], the [[SNOLAB]] underground laboratory at [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], the [[Gran Sasso National Laboratory]], the [[Canfranc Underground Laboratory]], the [[Boulby Underground Laboratory]], the [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]] and the [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory]].

These experiments mostly use either cryogenic or noble liquid detector technologies. Cryogenic detectors operating at temperatures below 100&nbsp;mK, detect the heat produced when a particle hits an atom in a crystal absorber such as [[germanium]]. [[Noble gas|Noble liquid]] detectors detect [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] produced by a particle collision in liquid [[xenon]] or [[argon]]. Cryogenic detector experiments include: [[Cryogenic Dark Matter Search|CDMS]], [[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers|CRESST]], [[EDELWEISS]], [[European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array|EURECA]]. Noble liquid experiments include ZEPLIN, [[XENON]], [[DEAP]], [[ArDM]], [[WIMP Argon Programme|WARP]], [[DarkSide]], [[PandaX]], and LUX, the [[Large Underground Xenon experiment]]. Both of these techniques focus strongly on their ability to distinguish background particles (which predominantly scatter off electrons) from dark matter particles (that scatter off nuclei). Other experiments include [[SIMPLE (dark matter)|SIMPLE]] and [[PICASSO (dark matter)|PICASSO]].

Currently there has been no well-established claim of dark matter detection from a direct detection experiment, leading instead to strong upper limits on the mass and interaction cross section with nucleons of such dark matter particles.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Drees|first1=M.|last2=Gerbier|first2=G.|title=Dark Matter|journal=Chin.

=== Collider searches for dark matter ===
An alternative approach to the detection of dark matter particles in nature is to produce them in a laboratory. Experiments with the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) may be able to detect dark matter particles produced in collisions of the LHC [[proton]] beams. Because a dark matter particle should have negligible interactions with normal visible matter, it may be detected indirectly as (large amounts of) missing energy and momentum that escape the detectors, provided other (non-negligible) collision products are detected.<ref name="kane watson">{{Cite journal |author1=Kane, G. |author2=Watson, S. |title=Dark Matter and LHC:. what is the Connection? |journal=Modern Physics Letters A |year=2008 |volume=23 |pages=2103–2123 |doi=10.1142/S0217732308028314 |bibcode=2008MPLA...23.2103K |arxiv=0807.2244 |issue=26}}</ref>

== Alternative hypotheses ==
{{More|Alternatives to general relativity}}
Because dark matter remains to be conclusively identified, many other hypotheses have emerged aiming to explain the observational phenomena that dark matter was conceived to explain. The most common method is to modify general relativity. General relativity is well-tested on solar system scales, but its validity on galactic or cosmological scales has not been well proven. A suitable modification to general relativity can conceivably eliminate the need for dark matter. The best-known theories of this class are [[MOND]] and its relativistic generalization [[tensor-vector-scalar gravity]] (TeVeS),<ref>For a review, see: {{cite journal |title=The failures of the Standard Model of Cosmology require a new paradigm |author=Pavel Kroupa |display-authors=etal |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |date=December 2012 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=1230003 |doi=10.1142/S0218271812300030 |arxiv = 1301.3907 |bibcode = 2012IJMPD..2130003K }}</ref> [[f(R) gravity]]<ref>For a review, see: {{cite journal |title=The dark matter problem from f(R) gravity viewpoint |author=Salvatore Capozziello |author2=Mariafelicia De Laurentis |journal=Annalen der Physik |date=October 2012|volume=524|issue=9–10|pages=545 |doi=10.1002/andp.201200109|bibcode = 2012AnP...524..545C }}</ref>, the [[negative mass]] [[dark fluid]] proposed by [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2018-12-05-bringing-balance-universe | title=Bringing balance to the Universe |publisher=University of Oxford}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-12-universe-theory-percent-cosmos.html | title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |publisher=Phys.Org}}</ref><ref name=Farnes>{{cite journal

A problem with alternative hypotheses is that the observational evidence for dark matter comes from so many independent approaches (see the "observational evidence" section above). Explaining any individual observation is possible but explaining all of them is very difficult. Nonetheless, there have been some scattered successes for alternative hypotheses, such as a 2016 test of gravitational lensing in entropic gravity.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-12-verlinde-theory-gravity.html |title=Verlinde's new theory of gravity passes first test |date=December 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=First test of Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity using Weak Gravitational Lensing measurements |first1=Margot M. |last1=Brouwer |display-authors=etal |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume= 466|issue=to appear |date=11 December 2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw3192 |arxiv=1612.03034 |pages=2547–2559|bibcode = 2017MNRAS.466.2547B }}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2116446-first-test-of-rival-to-einsteins-gravity-kills-off-dark-matter/|title=First test of rival to Einstein's gravity kills off dark matter|date=15 December 2016|accessdate=20 February 2017}}</ref>

The prevailing opinion among most astrophysicists is that while modifications to general relativity can conceivably explain part of the observational evidence, there is probably enough data to conclude there must be some form of dark matter.<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2012/05/09/dark-matter-vs-modified-gravity-a-trialogue/ |title=Dark Matter vs. Modified Gravity: a Trialogue |author-link=Sean M.

==In philosophy of science==

In [[philosophy of science]], dark matter is an example of an auxiliary hypothesis, an [[Ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc]] postulate that is added to a theory in response to observations that [[falsifiability|falsify]] it. It has been argued that the dark matter hypothesis is a [[conventionalism#Epistemology|conventionalist]] hypothesis, that is, a hypothesis that adds no empirical content and hence is unfalsifiable in the sense defined by [[Karl Popper]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Merritt |first1=David |title=Cosmology and convention |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |date=February 2017 |volume=57 |issue=2017 |pages=41–52 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2016.12.002|arxiv=1703.02389 |bibcode=2017SHPMP..57...41M }}</ref>

== In popular culture ==
{{Main|Dark matter in fiction}}
Mention of dark matter is made in works of fiction. In such cases, it is usually attributed extraordinary physical or magical properties. Such descriptions are often inconsistent with the hypothesized properties of dark matter in physics and cosmology.
<!-- Please do not add examples of dark matter in popular culture to this section. Add them to the main article on the subject, [[Dark matter in fiction]]. -->
