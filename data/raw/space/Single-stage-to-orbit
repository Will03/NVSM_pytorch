A '''single-stage-to-orbit''' (or '''SSTO''') vehicle reaches [[orbit]] from the surface of a body without jettisoning hardware, expending only propellants and fluids. The term usually, but not exclusively, refers to [[reusable launch system|reusable vehicles]].<ref name=vb020511>{{cite web |url=http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/tech_docs/JBIS_v56_108-117.pdf |title=A Comparison of Propulsion Concepts for SSTO Reusable Launchers |author=Richard Varvill |author2=Alan Bond |last-author-amp=yes |date=2003 |publisher=[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|JBIS]] |accessdate=5 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615104428/http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/tech_docs/JBIS_v56_108-117.pdf |archivedate=15 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> No Earth-launched SSTO launch vehicles have ever been constructed.

It is considered to be marginally possible to launch a single-stage-to-orbit [[Rocket engine#Chemically powered|chemically-fueled]] spacecraft from Earth. The principal complicating factors for SSTO from Earth are: high orbital velocity of over {{convert|7400|m/s|kph mph}}; the need to overcome Earth's gravity, especially in the early stages of flight; and flight within [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], which limits speed in the early stages of flight and influences engine performance.

Notable single stage to orbit research spacecraft include [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]], the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-X|DC-X]], the [[Lockheed Martin X-33]], and the [[Rotary Rocket|Roton SSTO]]. However, despite showing some promise, none of them has come close to achieving orbit yet due to problems with finding the most efficient propulsion system.<ref name=vb020511/>

Single-stage-to-orbit is much easier to achieve on extraterrestrial bodies which have weaker gravitational fields and lower atmospheric pressure than Earth, such as the Moon and Mars, and has been achieved from the [[Moon]] by both the [[Apollo program]]'s [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] and several robotic spacecraft of the Soviet [[Luna programme|Luna program]].

==History==

===Early concepts===
[[File:rombus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|ROMBUS concept art]]
For a long time before the second half of the twentieth century, the concept of a single stage to orbit vehicle was rarely considered, and was generally considered to be impractical; therefore very little research was conducted into the concept. However, advancements in flight technology led to the idea becoming more plausible, and during the 1960s some of the first concept designs for this kind of craft began to emerge.

Phil Bono (Douglas Space), Daniel Koelle of MBB and Edward Gomersall (NASA Ames)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gomersall|first1=Edward|title=A Single Stage To Orbit Shuttle Concept|date=July 20, 1970|publisher=NASA|location=Ames Mission Analysis Division Office of Advanced Research and Technology|id=N93-71495|pages=54|ref=MO-70-2}}</ref> were among the earlier proponents of SSTO designs.
One of the earliest was the One stage Orbital Space Truck (OOST) designed by [[Philip Bono]],<ref>Philip Bono and Kenneth William Gatland, ''Frontiers Of Space'', {{ISBN|0-7137-3504-X}}</ref> an engineer for [[Douglas Aircraft Company]], which was a concept for an expendable booster stage which could deliver a payload to orbit in one stage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|title=OOST|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/oost.htm|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2015-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010203856/http://astronautix.com/lvs/oost.htm|archivedate=10 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A reusable version named ROOST was also proposed. Another early SSTO design was a reusable launch vehicle named [[NEXUS (rocket)|NEXUS]] which was designed by [[Krafft Arnold Ehricke]] in the early 1960s. It was one of the largest spacecraft ever conceptualized with a diameter of over 50 metres and the capability to lift up to 2000 short tons into Earth orbit, intended for missions to further out locations in the solar system such as [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aerospace projects Review|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://www.up-ship.com/eAPR/ev3n1.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/ch2.htm|title=SP-4221 The Space Shuttle Decision|publisher=NASA History|accessdate=18 October 2015}}</ref> The North American Air Augmented VTOVL from 1963 was a similarly large craft which would have used external burning ramjets to decrease the liftoff mass of the vehicle by removing the need for large amounts of liquid oxygen while travelling through the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/norvtovl.htm|title=Encyclopedia Astronautica - North American Air Augmented VTOVL|accessdate=18 October 2015}}</ref>

From 1965, Robert Salked investigated various single stage to orbit spaceplane concepts, which would include wings. He proposed a vehicle which would burn [[hydrocarbon fuel]] while in the atmosphere and then switch to [[hydrogen fuel]] for increasing efficiency once in space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/saluttle.htm|title=Salkeld Shuttle|work=astronautix.com|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/sld039.htm|title=ROBERT SALKELD'S|work=pmview.com|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/sts25th/printFriendly/further.html|title=STS-1 Further Reading|work=nasa.gov|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> This was around the same time as the development of the [[space shuttle]].

Further examples of Bono's early concepts (prior to the 1990s) which were never constructed include:
*ROMBUS (Reusable Orbital Module, Booster, and Utility Shuttle), another design from Philip Bono.<ref name=aiaa1963-06>

Around 1985 the [[Rockwell X-30|NASP]] project was intended to create a scramjet vehicle to reach orbit, but this had its funding stopped and was cancelled.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020829020835/http://astronautix.com/lvs/x30.htm X-30]</ref> At around the same time, the [[HOTOL]] tried to use [[precooled jet engine]] technology, but failed to show significant advantages over rocket technology.<ref>''Flight international'' 1 March 1986</ref>

===DC-X technology===
{{Main article|McDonnell Douglas DC-X}}
[[Image:Delta Clipper DC-X first flight.jpg|thumb|right|The first flight of the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-X|DC-X]]]]
The DC-X, short for Delta Clipper Experimental, was an unmanned one-third scale SSTO vehicle which was too small to actually achieve orbit but was instead built to demonstrate vertical takeoff and landing. It is one of only a few prototype SSTO vehicles ever built. Several other prototypes of this design were proposed, including the DC-X2 (a half-scale prototype) and the DC-Y, a full-scale vehicle which would be capable of single stage insertion into orbit. Neither of these were built, but the project was taken over by [[NASA]] in 1995, and they built the DC-XA, an upgraded one-third scale prototype. This vehicle was lost when it landed with only three of its four landing pads deployed, which caused it to tip over on its side and explode. The project has not been continued since.

Despite this failure, several future proposals have been based on the DC-X design.

===Roton===
{{Main article|Rotary Rocket}}
From 1999 to 2001 Rotary Rocket attempted to build a SSTO vehicle called the Roton. It received a large amount of media attention and a working sub-scale prototype was completed, but the design was largely impractical.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.05/roton.html|title=Wired 4.05: Insanely Great? or Just Plain Insane?|work=wired.com|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>

==Approaches==

There have been various approaches to SSTO, including pure rockets that are launched and land vertically, air-breathing [[scramjet]]-powered vehicles that are launched and land horizontally, [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|nuclear-powered]] vehicles, and even [[Reaction Engines Skylon|jet-engine]]-powered vehicles that can fly into orbit and return landing like an airliner, completely intact.

For rocket-powered SSTO, the main challenge is achieving a high enough mass-ratio to carry sufficient [[propellant]] to achieve [[orbit]], plus a meaningful [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] weight.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} One possibility is to give the rocket an initial speed with a [[space gun]], as planned in the [[Quicklaunch]] project.

For air-breathing SSTO, the main challenge is system complexity and associated [[research and development]] costs, [[material science]], and construction techniques necessary for surviving sustained high-speed flight within the atmosphere, ''and'' achieving a high enough mass-ratio to carry sufficient propellant to achieve orbit, plus a meaningful payload weight. Air-breathing designs typically fly at [[supersonic]] or [[hypersonic]] speeds, and usually include a rocket engine for the final burn for orbit.<ref name=vb020511/>

Whether rocket-powered or air-breathing, a reusable vehicle must be rugged enough to survive multiple round trips into space without adding excessive weight or maintenance. In addition a reusable vehicle must be able to reenter without damage, and land safely.

While single-stage rockets were once thought to be beyond reach, advances in materials technology and construction techniques have shown them to be possible. For example, calculations show that the [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] first stage, launched on its own, would have a 25-to-1 ratio of fuel to vehicle hardware.<ref>{{cite web

==Design challenges inherent in SSTO==

The design space constraints of SSTO vehicles were described by rocket design engineer [[Robert Truax]]:

{{Quote|Using similar technologies (i.e., the same propellants and structural fraction), a two-stage-to-orbit vehicle will always have a better payload-to-weight ratio than a single stage designed for the same mission, in most cases, a very much better [payload-to-weight ratio]. Only when the structural factor approaches zero [very little vehicle structure weight] does the payload/weight ratio of a single-stage rocket approach that of a two-stage. A slight miscalculation and the single-stage rocket winds up with no payload. To get any at all, technology needs to be stretched to the limit. Squeezing out the last drop of specific impulse, and shaving off the last pound, costs money and/or reduces reliability.<ref>London III, Lt Col John R., "LEO on the Cheap", Air University (AFMC) Research Report No. AU-ARI-93-8, October 1994.</ref>}}

The [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]] expresses the maximum change in velocity any single rocket stage can achieve:

{{block indent|<math>\Delta v = I_\text{sp} \cdot g_0 \ln (MR)</math>}}

where:
{{block indent|<math>\Delta v</math> ([[delta-v]]) is the maximum change of velocity of the vehicle,}}
{{block indent|<math>I_\text{sp}</math> is the propellant [[specific impulse]],}}
{{block indent|<math>g_0</math> is the [[standard gravity]],}}
{{block indent|<math>MR</math> is the vehicle [[mass ratio]],}}
{{block indent|<math>\ln</math> refers to the [[natural logarithm]] function.}}

The mass ratio of a vehicle is defined as a ratio the initial vehicle mass when fully loaded with propellants <math>\left ( m_i \right )</math> to the final vehicle mass <math>\left ( m_f \right )</math> after the burn:

{{block indent|<math>MR = \frac {m_i} {m_f} = \frac {m_p + m_s + m_\text{pl}} {m_s + m_\text{pl}}</math>}}

where:
{{block indent|<math>m_i</math> is the initial vehicle mass or the [[Maximum takeoff weight|gross liftoff weight]] <math>\left ( GLOW \right )</math>,}}
{{block indent|<math>m_f</math> is the final vehicle mass after the burn,}}
{{block indent|<math>m_s</math> is the structural mass of vehicle,}}
{{block indent|<math>m_p</math> is the propellant mass,}}
{{block indent|<math>m_\text{pl}</math> is the payload mass.}}

The [[propellant mass fraction]] (<math>\zeta</math>) of a vehicle can be expressed solely as a function of the mass ratio:

{{block indent|<math>\zeta = \frac {m_p} {m_i} = \frac {m_i - m_f} {m_i} = 1 - \frac {m_f} {m_i} = 1 - \frac {1} {MR} = \frac {MR - 1} {MR}</math>}}

The structural coefficient (<math>\lambda</math>)  is a critical parameter in SSTO vehicle design.<ref>Hale, Francis, ''Introduction to Space Flight'', Prentice Hall, 1994.</ref> Structural efficiency of a vehicle is maximized as the structural coefficient approaches zero.  The structural coefficient is defined as:

[[File:SSTO vs TSTO for LEO Mission.tif|thumb|right|450px|alt=Plot of GLOW vs Structural Coefficient for LEO mission profile.|Comparison of growth factor sensitivity for Single-Stage-to-Orbit (SSTO) and restricted stage Two-Stage-to-Orbit (TSTO) vehicles. Based on a LEO mission of Delta v = 9.1 km/s and payload mass = 4500 kg for range of propellant Isp.]]

{{block indent|<math>\lambda = \frac {m_s} {m_p + m_s} = \frac {m_s} {m_i - m_\text{pl}} = \frac {\frac {m_s} {m_i}} {1 - \frac {m_\text{pl}} {m_i}}</math>}}

The overall structural mass fraction <math>\left ( \frac {m_s} {m_i} \right)</math> can be expressed in terms of the structural coefficient:

{{block indent|<math>\frac {m_s} {m_i} = \lambda \left ( 1 - \frac {m_\text{pl}} {m_i} \right )</math>}}

An additional expression for the overall structural mass fraction can be found by noting that the payload mass fraction <math>\left ( \frac {m_\text{pl}} {m_i} \right)</math>, propellant mass fraction and structural mass fraction sum to one:

{{block indent|<math>1 = \frac {m_\text{pl}} {m_i} + \frac {m_p} {m_i} + \frac {m_s} {m_i} = \frac {m_\text{pl}} {m_i} + \zeta + \frac {m_s} {m_i}</math>}}
{{block indent|<math>\frac {m_s} {m_i} = 1 - \zeta - \frac {m_\text{pl}} {m_i}</math>}}

Equating the expressions for structural mass fraction and solving for the initial vehicle mass yields:

{{block indent|<math>m_i = GLOW = \frac {m_\text{pl}} {1 - \left ( \frac {\zeta} {1 - \lambda} \right )}</math>}}

This expression shows how the size of a SSTO vehicle is dependent on its structural efficiency. Given a mission profile <math>\left( \Delta v, m_\text{pl} \right)</math> and propellant type <math>\left ( I_\text{sp} \right )</math>, the size of a vehicle increases with an increasing structural coefficient.<ref>Mossman, Jason, "Investigation of Advanced Propellants to Enable Single Stage to Orbit Launch Vehicles", Master's thesis, California State University, Fresno, 2006.</ref> This growth factor sensitivity is shown parametrically for both SSTO and [[two-stage-to-orbit]] (TSTO) vehicles for a standard LEO mission.<ref>Livington, J.W., "Comparative Analysis of Rocket and Air-Breathing Launch Vehicle Systems", Space 2004 Conference and Exhibit, San Diego, California, 2004.</ref> The curves vertically asymptote at the maximum structural coefficient limit where mission criteria can no longer be met:

{{block indent|<math>\lambda_\text{max} = 1 - \zeta = \frac {1} {MR}</math>}}

In comparison to a non-optimized TSTO vehicle using [[Multistage rocket|restricted staging]], a SSTO rocket launching an identical payload mass and using the same propellants will always require a substantially smaller structural coefficient to achieve the same delta-v. Given that current materials technology places a lower limit of approximately 0.1 on the smallest structural coefficients attainable,<ref>Curtis, Howard, ''[[Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students]]'', Third Edition, Oxford: Elsevier, 2010. Print.</ref> reusable SSTO vehicles are typically an impractical choice even when using the highest performance propellants available.

==Dense versus hydrogen fuels==
[[Hydrogen]] might seem the obvious fuel for SSTO vehicles. When burned with [[oxygen]], hydrogen gives the highest [[specific impulse]] of any commonly used fuel: around 450 seconds, compared with up to 350 seconds for [[kerosene]].

Hydrogen has the following advantages:

* Hydrogen has nearly 30% higher specific impulse (about 450 seconds vs. 350 seconds) than most dense fuels.
* Hydrogen is an excellent coolant.
* The gross mass of hydrogen stages is lower than dense-fuelled stages for the same payload.
* Hydrogen is environmentally friendly.

However, hydrogen also has these disadvantages:

* Very low density (about {{frac|1|7}} of the density of kerosene) – requiring a very large tank
* Deeply [[cryogenic]] – must be stored at very low temperatures and thus needs heavy insulation
* Escapes very easily from the smallest gap
* Wide combustible range – easily ignited and burns with a dangerously invisible flame
* Tends to condense oxygen which can cause flammability problems
* Has a large [[coefficient of expansion]] for even small heat leaks.

These issues can be dealt with, but at extra cost.

While kerosene tanks can be 1% of the weight of their contents, hydrogen tanks often must weigh 10% of their contents. This is because of both the low density and the additional insulation required to minimize boiloff (a problem which does not occur with kerosene and many other fuels). The low density of hydrogen further affects the design of the rest of the vehicle: pumps and pipework need to be much larger in order to pump the fuel to the engine. The end result is the thrust/weight ratio of hydrogen-fueled engines is 30–50% lower than comparable engines using denser fuels.

This inefficiency indirectly affects [[gravity drag|gravity losses]] as well; the vehicle has to hold itself up on rocket power until it reaches orbit. The lower excess thrust of the hydrogen engines due to the lower thrust/weight ratio means that the vehicle must ascend more steeply, and so less thrust acts horizontally. Less horizontal thrust results in taking longer to reach orbit, and gravity losses are increased by at least {{convert|300|m/s|kph mph}}. While not appearing large, the mass ratio to [[delta-v]] curve is very steep to reach orbit in a single stage, and this makes a 10% difference to the mass ratio on top of the tankage and pump savings.

The overall effect is that there is surprisingly little difference in overall performance between SSTOs that use hydrogen and those that use denser fuels, except that hydrogen vehicles may be rather more expensive to develop and buy. Careful studies have shown that some dense fuels (for example liquid [[propane]]) exceed the performance of hydrogen fuel when used in an SSTO launch vehicle by 10% for the same dry weight.<ref>{{cite web

In the 1960s [[Philip Bono]] investigated single-stage, VTVL [[tripropellant rocket]]s, and showed that it could improve payload size by around 30%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/fam/vtovl.htm|title=VTOVL|work=astronautix.com|accessdate=13 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702020846/http://www.astronautix.com/fam/vtovl.htm|archivedate=2 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Operational experience with the [[DC-X]] experimental rocket has caused a number of SSTO advocates to reconsider hydrogen as a satisfactory fuel. The late Max Hunter, while employing hydrogen fuel in the DC-X, often said that he thought the first successful orbital SSTO would more likely be fueled by propane.

==One engine for all altitudes==
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2017}}
Some SSTO vehicles use the same engine for all altitudes, which is a problem for traditional engines with a bell-shaped [[nozzle]]. Depending on the atmospheric pressure, different bell shapes are optimal. Engines operating in the lower atmosphere have shorter bells than those designed to work in vacuum. Having a bell that is only optimal at a single altitude lowers the overall engine efficiency.

One possible solution would be to use an [[aerospike engine]], which can be effective in a wide range of ambient pressures. In fact, a linear aerospike engine was used in the [[Lockheed Martin X-33|X-33]] design.

Other solutions involve using multiple engines and other [[altitude compensating nozzle|altitude adapting designs]] such as double-mu bells or [[expanding nozzle|extensible bell sections]].

Still, at very high altitudes, the extremely large engine bells tend to expand the exhaust gases down to near vacuum pressures. As a result, these engine bells are counterproductive{{dubious|date=December 2017}} due to their excess weight. Some SSTO vehicles simply use very high pressure engines which permit high ratios to be used from ground level. This gives good performance, negating the need for more complex solutions.

==Airbreathing SSTO==

Some designs for SSTO attempt to use [[airbreathing jet engine]]s that collect oxidizer and reaction mass from the atmosphere to reduce the take-off weight of the vehicle.

Some of the issues with this approach are:

* No known air breathing engine is capable of operating at orbital speed within the atmosphere (for example hydrogen fueled [[scramjet]]s seem to have a top speed of about Mach&nbsp;17).<ref>{{cite web
 |url        = http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/x30.htm

 |accessdate = 2007-11-15
}}</ref> This means that rockets must be used for the final orbital insertion.
* Rocket thrust needs the orbital mass to be as small as possible to minimize propellant weight.
* The thrust-to-weight ratio of rockets that rely on on-board oxygen increases dramatically as fuel is expended, because the oxidizer fuel tank has about 1% of the mass as the oxidizer it carries, whereas air-breathing engines traditionally have a poor thrust/weight ratio which is relatively fixed during the air-breathing ascent.
* Very high speeds in the atmosphere necessitate very heavy thermal protection systems, which makes reaching orbit even harder.
* While at lower speeds, air-breathing engines are very efficient, but the efficiency ([[Specific impulse|Isp]]) and thrust levels of air-breathing jet engines drop considerably at high speed (above Mach 5–10 depending on the engine) and begin to approach that of rocket engines or worse.
* [[Lift to drag ratio]]s of vehicles at hypersonic speeds are poor, however the effective lift to drag ratios of rocket vehicles at high g is [[gravity drag|not dissimilar]].

Thus with for example scramjet designs (e.g. [[NASA X-43|X-43]]) the mass budgets do not seem to close for orbital launch.

Similar issues occur with single-stage vehicles attempting to carry conventional jet engines to orbit—the weight of the jet engines is not compensated sufficiently by the reduction in propellant.<ref name=sstovarvill>{{cite web

On the other hand, LACE-like [[precooled jet engine|precooled airbreathing]] designs such as the [[Reaction Engines Skylon|Skylon spaceplane]] (and [[ATREX]]) which transition to rocket thrust at rather lower speeds (Mach&nbsp;5.5) do seem to give, on paper at least, an improved orbital [[Propellant mass fraction|mass fraction]] over pure rockets (even multistage rockets) sufficiently to hold out the possibility of full reusability with better payload fraction.<ref>Cimino, P.; Drake, J.; Jones, J.; Strayer, D.; Venetoklis, P.: [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985STIA...8726190C "Transatmospheric vehicle propelled by air-turborocket engines"], ''AIAA, Joint Propulsion Conference, 21st, Monterey, CA, July 8–11, 1985. 10 p. Research supported by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.'', 07/1985</ref>

It is important to note that mass fraction is an important concept in the engineering of a rocket. However, mass fraction may have little to do with the costs of a rocket, as the costs of fuel are very small when compared to the costs of the engineering program as a whole. As a result, a cheap rocket with a poor mass fraction may be able to deliver more payload to orbit with a given amount of money than a more complicated, more efficient rocket.

==Launch assists==
Many vehicles are only narrowly suborbital, so practically anything that gives a relatively small delta-v increase can be helpful, and outside assistance for a vehicle is therefore desirable.

Proposed launch assists include:
*[[Rocket sled launch|sled launch]] (rail, maglev including [[Rocket sled launch|Bantam, MagLifter]], and [[StarTram]], etc.)<ref>https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1116&context=ijaaa</ref>
*[[air launch|air launch or aircraft tow]]
*in-flight fueling
*[[Lofstrom launch loop]]/[[space fountain]]s

And on-orbit resources such as:
*[[Space tether]]
*tugs

==Nuclear propulsion==
{{main article|Nuclear propulsion}}
Due to weight issues such as shielding, many nuclear propulsion systems are unable to lift their own weight, and hence are unsuitable for launching to orbit. However some designs such as the [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion project]] and some [[Nuclear thermal rocket|nuclear thermal]] designs do have a [[thrust to weight ratio]] in excess of&nbsp;1, enabling them to lift off. Clearly one of the main issues with nuclear propulsion would be safety, both during a launch for the passengers, but also in case of a failure during launch. No current program is attempting nuclear propulsion from Earth's surface.

==Beam-powered propulsion==
{{main article|Beam-powered propulsion}}
Because they can be more energetic than the potential energy that chemical fuel allows for, some laser or microwave powered rocket concepts have the potential to launch vehicles into orbit, single stage. In practice, this area is relatively undeveloped, and current technology falls far short of this.

==Comparison with the Shuttle==
The high cost per launch of the [[Space Shuttle]] sparked interest throughout the 1980s in designing a cheaper successor vehicle. Several official design studies were done, but most were basically smaller versions of the existing Shuttle concept.

Most cost analysis studies of the Space Shuttle have shown that workforce is by far the single greatest expense. Early shuttle discussions speculated airliner-type operation, with a two-week turnaround. However, senior NASA planners envisioned no more than 10 to 12 flights per year for the entire shuttle fleet. The absolute maximum flights per year for the entire fleet was limited by external tank manufacturing capacity to 24 per year.<ref>{{cite web

Very efficient (hence complex and sophisticated) [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|main engines]] were required to fit within the available vehicle space. Likewise the only known suitable lightweight [[Space shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection]] was delicate, maintenance-intensive [[silica]] tiles. These and other design decisions resulted in a vehicle that requires great maintenance after every mission. The engines are removed and inspected, and prior to the new "block&nbsp;II" main engines, the [[turbopump]]s were removed, disassembled and rebuilt. While [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]] was refurbished and relaunched in 53&nbsp;days between missions [[STS-51-J]] and [[STS-61-B]], generally months were required to repair an orbiter for a new mission.

==Examples==
It is easier to achieve SSTO from a body with lower gravitational pull than Earth, such as the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]]. The [[Apollo Lunar Module]] ascended from the lunar surface to lunar orbit in a single stage.

A detailed study into SSTO vehicles was prepared by [[Chrysler Corporation]]'s Space Division in 1970–1971 under NASA contract NAS8-26341. Their proposal ([[Shuttle SERV]]) was an enormous vehicle with more than {{convert|50000|kg}} of payload, utilizing [[jet engine]]s for (vertical) landing.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> While the technical problems seemed to be solvable, the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] required a winged design that led to the Shuttle as we know it today.

The unmanned [[DC-X]] technology demonstrator, originally developed by [[McDonnell Douglas]] for the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) program office, was an attempt to build a vehicle that could lead to an SSTO vehicle. The one-third-size test craft was operated and maintained by a small team of three people based out of a trailer, and the craft was once relaunched less than 24&nbsp;hours after landing. Although the test program was not without mishap (including a minor explosion), the DC-X demonstrated that the maintenance aspects of the concept were sound. That project was cancelled when it landed with three of four legs deployed, tipped over, and exploded on the fourth flight after transferring management from the [[Strategic Defense Initiative Organization]] to NASA.

The [[Aquarius Launch Vehicle]] was designed to bring bulk materials to orbit as cheaply as possible.

==Current development==
Current and previous SSTO projects include the Japanese [[Kankoh-maru]] project, the [[Reaction Engines Skylon|Skylon]], [[Haas (rocket)|ARCA Haas 2C]], and the Indian [[Avatar (spacecraft)|Avatar]] spaceplane.

==Alternative approaches to inexpensive spaceflight==
Many studies have shown that regardless of selected technology, the most effective cost reduction technique is [[economies of scale]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Merely launching a large total number reduces the manufacturing costs per vehicle, similar to how the [[mass production]] of automobiles brought about great increases in affordability.

Using this concept, some aerospace analysts believe the way to lower launch costs is the exact opposite of SSTO. Whereas reusable SSTOs would reduce per launch costs by making a reusable high-tech vehicle that launches frequently with low maintenance, the "mass production" approach views the technical advances as a source of the cost problem in the first place. By simply building and launching large quantities of rockets, and hence launching a large volume of payload, costs can be brought down. This approach was attempted in the late 1970s, early 1980s in [[West Germany]] with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]-based [[OTRAG]] [[OTRAG Rocket|rocket]].

A related idea is to obtain economies of scale from building simple, massive, multi-stage rockets using cheap, off-the-shelf parts. The vehicles would be dumped into the ocean after use. This strategy is known as the "[[big dumb booster]]" approach.

This is somewhat similar to the approach some previous systems have taken, using simple engine systems with "low-tech" fuels, as the [[Russian Space Agency|Russian]] and [[China National Space Administration|Chinese space program]]s still do. These nations' launches are significantly cheaper than their Western counterparts.

An alternative to scale is to make the discarded stages practically [[reusable launch system|reusable]]: this is the goal of the [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program]] and its Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and BFR vehicles. A similar approach is being pursued by [[Blue Origin]].
