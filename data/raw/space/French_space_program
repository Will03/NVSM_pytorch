The '''''French space program''''' includes both [[commercial spaceflight|civil]] and [[military]] [[spaceflight]] activities. It is the 3rd oldest institutional space program in history, along with the [[USSR]] and the [[US]]; and the largest space program in [[Europe]].

==Background==
[[File:Fusée sur tapisserie.png|thumb|Space rocket imagined on a [[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelins]] [[tapestry]], ordered by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] and drawn by [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], 1664.]]
Space travel has long been a significant ambition in [[French culture]]. From the [[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelins]]' 1664 tapestry representing a space rocket,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/sfhm/hsm/HSMx1972x006x004/HSMx1972x006x004x0250.pdf|format=PDF|title=Astronautique|author=Jean Cheymol|website=Biusante.parisdescartes.fr|accessdate=2017-08-11}}</ref> to [[Jules Verne]]'s 1865 novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon|De la terre à la lune]]'' and [[George Méliès]]' 1902 movie ''[[A Trip to the Moon|Voyage dans la lune]]'', space and [[rocket]]ry were present in French society long before the technological means appeared to allow the development of a space exploration program.

During the late 18th century, [[Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier]], [[Jacques Charles]] and the [[Montgolfier brothers]] are seen as worldwide precursors and explorers of [[aeronautics]], with the world record altitude then reached by a human at 7,016 metres (23,018&nbsp;ft) performed by [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] in 1804. Those names, their numerous students and their works will mark the early expertise of France's space program in all types of air balloons since.

In the beginning of the twentieth century, the origins of the French space program are tied to French technological developments in [[aerospace]] and [[astronautics]], notably the nascent [[airplane]] and rocket industries.

[[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] appears as one of the early pioneers in space exploration design and rocket science. From 1908, he studied propulsion and space flight; without knowing the work of Russian mathematician [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] at that time, he derived the mathematical equations for interplanetary flight, flight durations, and engine propulsion, and was later nominated President of the ''Chambre Syndicale des Industries Aéronautiques'' (Trade association of Aircraft industries) in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Robert_Esnault-Pelterie/118432|title=Encyclopédie Larousse en ligne - Robert Esnault-Pelterie|first=Éditions|last=Larousse|website=Larousse.fr|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref> From 1935 to 1939 he designed a high-altitude [[sounding rocket]], but [[World War II]] interrupted his plans; German experts believed that the rocket could have reached its design goal of {{convert|60|mi}}.<ref name="ley196406">{{Cite magazine

Between 1927 and 1933, Barré did extensive research and developed a rocket that could reach the upper atmosphere and space, the EA-41 ''Eole'' (see picture).<ref name="Villain, 1993">Jacques Villain, 1993 : ''Jean-Jacques Barré pionnier français des fusées et de l'astronautique'' SEP, 1993</ref>

==History==
The beginning of the institutional French space program dates back to 1946 when, right after [[World War II]], the {{illm|Laboratoire de recherches balistiques et aérodynamiques|fr}} (LRBA) was created in [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]] to develop the next generation of rockets, partly taking advantage of the German development of the [[V2 rocket]].

Before this and during the [[WWII|war]], as [[Free France]] continued to function, the EA-41 was tested and improved by [[Free French Forces|military personnel]], from October 1942 through to 1945.<ref name="Chronologie Ariane">{{Cite web |url=http://www.capcomespace.net/dossiers/espace_europeen/ariane/index.htm |title=Chronologie Ariane |website=Capcom Espace |language=French |access-date=6 February 2017}}</ref>

22 May 1952: [[Veronique (rocket)|Véronique N1]] is successfully launched from the [[Sahara desert|Saharan desert]].<ref name="Chronologie Ariane"/>

In 1958, [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] directed the creation of several space research committees. In 1959, the Comité d'études spatiales was born under the supervision of [[Pierre Auger]].
In 1961, de Gaulle signed the creation of the Centre National d' Etudes Spatiales ([[CNES]]) to coordinate French space activities. Development of Western Europe's first [[carrier rocket]], the [[Diamant]], began in 1962, first launched in Algeria.

November 26, 1965: at 15h 47mn and 21s, [[Asterix (satellite)|Asterix]], the first French satellite in space, is successfully launched by a Diamant rocket from the Algerian desert. It is active for 2 consecutive days before ceasing to transmit.<ref name="Chronologie Ariane"/>

In 1965, France's space [[launch pad]]s and CNES settled in [[Kourou]].

In 1973, France impulsed the creation of the [[European Space Agency]] and became its first contributor.

The French space [[budget]], although stagnant since the early 2000s in constant [[euro]]s, remains in absolute terms the largest of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the second largest national budget (after the United States of America) at 2,33 Billion €.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cnes.fr/fr/web/CNES-fr/11507-le-2eme-budget-au-monde.php|title=Le 2ème budget au monde|website=cnes.fr|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref> In 2004, this budget stood at 1.698 billion euros, with 685 million being transferred to the Paris-based ESA for the programs conducted under its supervision.

The [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane]] rocket family is France's own launcher family, which use has been extended to the whole of ESA's member countries.

Its spaceport, near [[Kourou]], was selected in 1964 to host all of France's launches. Later, it was selected as ESA's launch site. Before being in [[French Guiana]], France's space launches were made from [[French Algeria|Algeria]], in [[Colomb-Béchar]] and [[Hammaguir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnes-csg.fr/web/CNES-CSG-fr/9777-implantation.php|title=Choix de la Guyane - CNES|website=Cnes-csg.fr|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref>

The French space program thus benefits from the best ground position for launch sites on Earth, as its position 5.3° north of the [[equator]] allows rockets to gain propulsion from the spinning of the Earth when launched eastward (+460&nbsp;m/s) and save on propellant. No other governmental launch sites allow this level of physical parameters. It is also able to launch satellites into [[polar orbit]]s from this spaceport.

==Collaborations==
[[File:Columbus module - cropped.jpg|thumb|Columbus module – cropped]]
France's public involvement in space technologies is also deep into European programs such as [[Columbus Man-Tended Free Flyer|Columbus]] and [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]], through [[Thales Alenia]], headquartered in [[Cannes]].

The French space program includes collaborations between its institutions and other countries, European as well as other foreign countries and institutions ([[JAXA]], [[ISRO]], [[NASA]], [[China National Space Administration|CNSA]]) in projects ranging from the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] to [[BepiColombo]], [[Saral/Altika]] and the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck space observatory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cnes.fr/fr/fiches_mission_alpha|title=cnes - Bibliothèque des projets du CNES|website=cnes.fr|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref>

In 2016, for the [[COP21]], CNES and ISRO impulsed a groundbreaking and worldwide plan to unite all space agencies for the gathering of satellite information and detection on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, allowing more precise measurements and decision making.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cnes.fr/en/worlds-space-agencies-unite-face-climate-challenge|title=World’s space agencies unite to face the climate challenge|website=cnes.fr|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref>

In addition, CNES and ESA have a strong background of collaboration, notably building the largest single satellite surveyance program for earth's biological monitoring ([[Copernicus Programme]]).

==Future projects and international collaborations==
The construction of the Ariane 6 launcher is underway, after being approved by all ESA countries in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://spacenews.com/42699esa-members-agree-to-build-ariane-6-fund-station-through-2017/|title=ESA Members Agree To Build Ariane 6, Fund Station Through 2017|publisher=[[SpaceNews]]|first1=Peter B.|last1=de Selding|date=2 December 2014|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>  It is designed by [[Airbus Safran Launchers]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://spacenews.com/desire-for-competitive-ariane-6-nudges-esa-toward-compromise-in-funding-dispute-with-contractor/|title=Desire for Competitive Ariane 6 Nudges ESA Toward Compromise in Funding Dispute with Contractor|publisher=[[SpaceNews]]|first1=Peter B.|last1=de Selding|date=3 April 2015|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>

Since 2010, France and [[Russia]] have been collaborating on several space missions, including long-run science programmes like [[Cardiomed]], dedicated to monitoring [[cardiovascular]] health in [[cosmonauts]].<ref>https://cardiomed.cnes.fr/fr/CARDIOMED/Fr/index.htm</ref>

CNES has provided essential instruments (cameras) on an Indian mission to the moon, launched in January 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telesatellite.com/actu/48815-cooperation-spatiale-entre-la-france-et-inde.html|title=Coopération spatiale entre la France et l'Inde|language=FR|publisher=Télé Satellite et Numérique|date=12 January 2017|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>
A consortium led by the CNES also built [[Argos system|Argos]] instruments on board the Indian mission [[Oceansat]] 3 in 2018.<ref>{{Cite press release|url=https://presse.cnes.fr/en/france-india-space-cooperation-cnes-and-isro-review-joint-projects-bengaluru-space-expo-2016|title=France-India space cooperation – CNES and ISRO review joint projects at Bengaluru Space Expo 2016|language=FR|publisher=[[CNES]]|date=1 September 2016|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref> 
A third collaboration between the ISRO and French space actors ([[Laboratoire d’études spatiales et d’instrumentation en astrophysique]] (Lesia), [[CNRS]], [[Université Paris-VI]] and [[Université Paris-VII]]) has seen the launch of [[PicSat]] in January 2018, a [[Cubesat|nano-satellite]] that surveys the [[Beta Pictoris]] star for [[exoplanets]].<ref>https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2018/01/09/un-microsatellite-a-l-affut-d-une-exoplanete_5239167_1650684.html</ref>
{{update section|date=January 2019}}
In 2018, CNES and JAXA will launch the BepiColombo mission to study the magnetic field of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and map its surface.

In 2018, [[Solar Orbiter]] will be launched by NASA, containing instruments designed by CNES and other French industrial actors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://solar-orbiter.cnes.fr/fr/SOLO/Fr/index.htm|title=Solar Orbiter|language=FR|publisher=[[CNES]]|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>

Starting in 2018, the [[CFOSAT]] (China-France Oceanography SATellite) will be placed into Earth orbit to study [[ocean]] surface winds and [[Wind wave|wave]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cfosat.cnes.fr/en/CFOSAT/index.htm|title=CfoSat|publisher=[[CNES]]|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>
After [[Emmanuel Macron|President Macron]]'s state visit to China in January 2018, the French-Chinese collaboration in space was increased significantly and includes more in-depth collaboration, notably in the sharing of CFOSAT data, meant to study oceans and their interaction with the atmosphere, as well as in the [[SVOM]] program.<ref>https://presse.cnes.fr/fr/visite-detat-du-president-de-la-republique-en-republique-populaire-de-chine-renforcement-de-la</ref>

The French mission Taranis (with international laboratories collaboration) will be also launched in 2018. It is the 1st satellite designed to observe lightning at altitudes of 20 to 100&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://taranis.cnes.fr/en/TARANIS/index.htm|title=Taranis|publisher=[[CNES]]|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>

The French space agency was also responsible for the construction of the main instruments on the French-German-American [[InSight]] mission to Mars, scheduled for launch on the 5th May 2018 and due for arrival in November 2018.

In 2021 France and [[Germany]] will launch their collaborative mission [[Merlin (spacecraft)|Merlin]], due to study [[methane]] levels and concentrations in the earth's [[atmosphere]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://merlin.cnes.fr/fr/MERLIN/Fr/index.htm|title=Merlin|language=FR|publisher=[[CNES]]|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>

2022 will mark the launch of [[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer|JUICE]] (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer). It will study [[Jupiter]] and three of its moons with a view to gaining new insights into how life emerged.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://juice.cnes.fr/fr/JUICE/Fr/index.htm|title=Juice|language=FR|publisher=[[CNES]]|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref> This mission is a collaboration of CNES with [[CNRS]] and ESA.
