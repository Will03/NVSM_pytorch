'''Deep space exploration''' (or '''deep-space exploration''') is the branch of [[astronomy]], [[astronautics]] and [[space technology]] that is involved with exploring the distant regions of [[outer space]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/education/space_ex/exploration.html |title=Space and its Exploration: How Space is Explored |work=NASA.gov |accessdate=2009-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702153058/http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/education/space_ex/exploration.html |archivedate=2009-07-02 |df= }}</ref> Physical [[space exploration|exploration of space]] is conducted both by [[human spaceflight]]s (deep-space astronautics) and by [[robotic spacecraft]].

At present the furthest space probe mankind has constructed and launched from Earth is [[Voyager 1]], which was announced on December 5, 2011<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/news/new_region.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106063528/http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/news/new_region.html |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}</ref> to have reached the outer edge of the Solar system,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/980224b.html |title=The Farthest Spacecraft |work=NASA.gov |date=1998-02-24 |accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref> and entered [[interstellar space]] on August 25, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2013/0912_voyager-heliosphere.shtml |first=Brandon |last=Bryn |title=Voyager 1 Now Probing Unexplored Region of Space |work=Science |date=2013-09-12}}</ref> Deep space exploration further than this vessel's capacity is not yet possible due to limitations in the space-engine technology currently available.

Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include [[anti-matter]], [[nuclear power]] and [[beam-powered propulsion|beamed propulsion]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/exploration/futurespaceflight/index.shtml |title=Future Spaceflight |work=BBC |accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref> The latter, beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes.<ref name="Forward1996">{{cite journal |title=Ad Astra! |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |first=Robert L |last=Forward |volume=49 |pages=23â€“32 |date=January 1996 |bibcode = 1996JBIS...49...23F }}</ref>

==Current research==

In 2012, the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] announced the award of $500,000 to former astronaut [[Mae Jemison]] to fund a project with the goal of sending future astronauts out of the Solar System. Jemison aims to increase public interest in future deep space exploration projects.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vastag |first=Brian |title=Starship dreamers launch 100-year mission with DARPA grant |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/starship-dreamers-launch-100-year-mission-with-darpa-grant/2012/05/22/gIQA2k8wiU_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=May 22, 2012}}</ref> Upon awarding the money to Jemison, a "[[100 Year Starship]]" symposium was held in [[Houston, Texas]] to discuss interstellar travel. Topics discussed include "time-distance solutions; life sciences in space exploration; destinations and habitats; becoming an interstellar civilization; space technologies enhancing life on earth; and commercial opportunities from interstellar efforts".<ref>{{cite web|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=Interstellar Starship Meeting Warps Into Houston This Week|url=http://www.space.com/17507-interstellar-space-travel-100-year-starship.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref>

Research in deep space is ongoing and rapidly developing. In 2011, after the retirement of the [[space shuttle]], NASA announced its intentions to invest money into developing three technologies vital to deep space exploration. The "must-have technologies" include a deep space atomic clock, a large solar sail and a more advanced laser communications system to improve communication, navigation, and propulsion in future missions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wall|first=Mike|title=NASA Picks 3 Pioneering Technologies for Deep Space Travel|url=http://www.space.com/12697-nasa-space-technology-demonstration-missions.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref> In June 2013, NASA announced the selection of eight American astronauts that will begin to train for future deep space missions beyond low Earth orbit. NASA intends that these eight astronauts to train for future Mars or asteroid travel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=NASA Unveils New Astronaut Class for Deep-Space Exploration|url=http://www.space.com/21585-nasa-unveils-astronauts-deep-space.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref>

The Single Aperture Far-Infrared Observatory ([[SAFIR]]), a proposed cryogenic space telescope, is tentatively set to launch in 2015 with the hopes of exploring "the formation of the first stars and galaxies" in deep space. The telescope will be more than 1000 times more sensitive than two current telescope spacecrafts, the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and the [[Herschel Space Observatory]]. NASA hopes to use SAFIR to learn about black holes, [[galaxy formation and evolution]] and the formation of [[star system]]s in the far reaches of space.<ref>{{cite web |title=SAFIR - Single Aperture Far Infrared Observatory |url=http://safir.jpl.nasa.gov/index.shtml |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref>
