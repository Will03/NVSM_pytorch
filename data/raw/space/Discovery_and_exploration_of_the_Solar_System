[[File:Pioneer 10-11 - P51b - fx.jpg|thumb|''[[Pioneer 11|Pioneer]]'' space probe's Quadrispherical Plasma Analyzer]]
For many thousands of years, astronomers maintained a [[geocentric]] world view and did not recognize the existence of a [[Solar System]].  Most believed Earth was stationary at the center of the [[Universe]] and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky.  Although the Greek philosopher [[Aristarchus of Samos]] had speculated on a [[heliocentric]] reordering of the cosmos, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in the 16th century developed a mathematically predictive heliocentric system.  His 17th-century successors, [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Johannes Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton]], developed a modern understanding of [[physics]] that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that govern Earth. In more recent times, this led to the investigation of geological phenomena such as mountains and craters and seasonal meteorological phenomena such as clouds, dust storms, and ice caps on the other planets.

The first exploration of the Solar System was conducted by [[telescope]], when [[astronomy|astronomers]] first began to map those objects too faint to be seen with the naked eye.

[[Galileo]] was the first to discover physical details about the individual bodies of the Solar System. He discovered that the [[Moon]] was cratered, that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) |author=Eric W.

[[File:Mercury transit 2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sun]] photographed through a telescope with special solar filter. [[Sunspot]]s and [[limb darkening]] can be clearly seen. Mercury is transiting in the lower middle of the Sun's face.]]
[[Edmond Halley]] realised in 1705 that repeated sightings of [[Halley's Comet|a comet]] were recording the same object, returning regularly once every 75–76 years. This was the first evidence that anything other than the planets orbited the Sun.<ref>{{cite web |title=Comet Halley |work=University of Tennessee |url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/comets/halley.html |accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref> Around this time (1704), the term "Solar System" first appeared in English.<ref>{{cite web |title=Etymonline: Solar System |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=solar+system&searchmode=none |accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref>

In 1781, [[William Herschel]] was looking for [[binary star]]s in the constellation of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] when he observed what he thought was a new comet. Its orbit revealed that it was a new planet, Uranus, the first ever discovered.<ref>{{cite web |title=Herschel, Sir William (1738–1822) |work=enotes.com |url=http://science.enotes.com/earth-science/herschel-sir-william |accessdate=2006-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509151843/http://science.enotes.com/earth-science/herschel-sir-william |archivedate=2006-05-09 |df= }}</ref>

[[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovered [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] in 1801, a small world between Mars and Jupiter that initially was considered a new planet. However, subsequent discoveries of thousands of other small worlds in the same region led to their eventual reclassification as [[asteroid]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Discovery of Ceres: 2nd Centenary, January 1, 1801–January 1, 2001 |work=astropa.unipa.it |year=2000 |url=http://www.astropa.unipa.it/Asteroids2001/ |accessdate=2006-11-08}}</ref>

By 1846, discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus led many to suspect a large planet must be tugging at it from farther out. [[Urbain Le Verrier]]'s calculations eventually led to the discovery of Neptune.<ref name="Planets">{{cite web |title=Mathematical discovery of planets |author=J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson |work=St. Andrews University |year=1996 |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Neptune_and_Pluto.html |accessdate=2006-11-08}}</ref> The excess perihelion precession of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit led Le Verrier to postulate the intra-Mercurian planet [[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]] in 1859, but that would turn out to be an [[Ignoratio elenchi|irrelevant thesis]].

Although it is debatable when the Solar System was truly "discovered", three 19th century observations determined its nature and place in the Universe beyond reasonable doubt. First, in 1838, [[Friedrich Bessel]] successfully measured a [[stellar parallax]], an apparent shift in the position of a star created by Earth's motion around the Sun. This was not only the first direct, experimental proof of heliocentrism, but also revealed, for the first time, the vast distance between the Solar System and the stars. Then, in 1859, [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], using the newly invented [[spectroscope]], examined the spectral signature of the Sun and discovered that it was composed of the same elements as existed on Earth, establishing for the first time a physical link between Earth and the heavens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spectroscopy and the Birth of Astrophysics|work=Center for History of Physics, a Division of the American Institute of Physics|url=http://www.aip.org/history/cosmology/tools/tools-spectroscopy.htm|accessdate=2008-04-30}}</ref> Then, Father [[Angelo Secchi]] compared the spectral signature of the Sun with those of other stars, and found them virtually identical. The realisation that the Sun was a star led to the hypothesis that other stars could have systems of their own, though this was not to be proven for nearly 140 years.
[[File:Asteroid2006DP14.jpg|thumb|Radar-imaging of {{mpl-|388188|2006 DP|14}}, a small near-Earth asteroid that passed by Earth in early February 2014]]
Further apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the outer planets led [[Percival Lowell]] to conclude that yet another planet, "[[Planet X]]", must lie beyond Neptune. After his death, his [[Lowell Observatory]] conducted a search that ultimately led to [[Clyde Tombaugh]]'s discovery of [[Pluto]] in 1930. Pluto was, however, found to be too small to have disrupted the orbits of the outer planets, and its discovery was therefore coincidental. Like Ceres, it was initially considered to be a planet, but after the discovery of many other similarly sized objects in its vicinity it was reclassified in 2006 as a [[dwarf planet]] by the IAU.<ref name="Planets"/>

In 1992, the first evidence of a [[planetary system]] other than our own was discovered, orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR B1257+12]]. Three years later, [[51 Pegasi b]], the first [[extrasolar planet]] around a Sunlike star, was discovered. As of 2017,  2687 extrasolar systems have been found.<ref>{{cite web |title=Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia |work=Paris Observatory |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |accessdate=2017-02-15}}</ref>

Also in 1992, astronomers [[David C. Jewitt]] of the [[University of Hawaii]] and [[Jane Luu]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] discovered [[15760 Albion]]. This object proved to be the first of a new population, which became known as the [[Kuiper belt]]; an icy analogue to the asteroid belt of which such objects as Pluto and Charon were deemed a part.<ref>{{cite web |title=KUIPER BELT OBJECTS: Relics from the Accretion Disk of the Sun |author=Jane X.

[[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], [[Chad Trujillo]] and [[David L. Rabinowitz|David Rabinowitz]] announced the discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] in 2005, a [[scattered disc]] object initially thought to be larger than Pluto, which would make it the largest object discovered in orbit around the Sun since Neptune.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eris (2003 UB313) |work=Solstation.com |year=2006 |url=http://www.solstation.com/stars/ub313.htm |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref> ''[[New Horizons]]''' fly-by of [[Pluto]] in July 2015 resulted in more-accurate measurements of Pluto, which is slightly larger, though less massive, than Eris.

Since the start of the [[Space Age]], a great deal of exploration has been performed by [[robotic spacecraft]] missions that have been organized and executed by various space agencies.

All planets in the Solar System have now been visited to varying degrees by spacecraft launched from Earth. Through these unmanned missions, humans have been able to get close-up photographs of all the planets and, in the case of [[Lander (spacecraft)|landers]], perform tests of the soils and [[atmosphere]]s of some.

The first artificial object sent into space was the Soviet satellite ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', launched in 1957, which successfully orbited Earth until 4 January the following year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sputnik 1 |work=NASA |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1957-001B |accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref> The American probe ''[[Explorer 6]]'', launched in 1959, was the first satellite to image Earth from space.

===Flybys===
The first successful probe to fly by another Solar System body was ''[[Luna 1]]'', which sped past the Moon in 1959.  Originally meant to impact with the Moon, it instead missed its target and became the first artificial object to orbit the Sun.  ''[[Mariner 2]]'' was the first [[planetary flyby]], passing Venus in 1962.  The first successful flyby of Mars was made by ''[[Mariner 4]]'' in 1965. ''[[Mariner 10]]'' first passed [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 1974.

The first probe to explore the outer planets was ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', which flew by Jupiter in 1973. ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' was the first to visit Saturn, in 1979. The [[Voyager program|''Voyager'']] probes performed a grand tour of the outer planets following their launch in 1977, with both probes passing Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980 &ndash; 1981. ''[[Voyager 2]]'' then went on to make close approaches to Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989. The ''Voyager'' probes are now far beyond Neptune's orbit, and are on course to find and study the [[termination shock]], heliosheath, and heliopause. According to [[NASA]], both ''Voyager'' probes have encountered the termination shock at a distance of approximately 93&nbsp;AU from the Sun.<ref>{{cite web |year=2002 |title=Time Line of Space Exploration |author=Randy Culp |url=http://my.execpc.com/~culp/space/timeline.html |accessdate=2006-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828211027/http://my.execpc.com/~culp/space/timeline.html |archivedate=2006-08-28 |df= }}</ref>

The first flyby of a comet occurred in 1985, when the ''[[International Cometary Explorer]]'' (ICE) passed by the comet [[21P/Giacobini–Zinner|Giacobini–Zinner]],<ref>[http://spider.seds.org/spider/Comets/c_missions.html Comet Space Missions], accessed 2007-10-23.</ref> whereas the first flybys of asteroids were conducted by the ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' space probe, which imaged both [[951 Gaspra]] (in 1991) and [[243 Ida]] (in 1993) on its way to [[Jupiter]].

Launched on January 19, 2006, the ''[[New Horizons]]'' probe is the first man-made spacecraft to explore the Kuiper belt. This unmanned mission flew by Pluto in July 2015. The mission was extended to observe a number of other Kuiper belt objects, including a close flyby of {{mp|486958|2014 MU|69}} on New Year's Day, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |year=2006 |title=New Horizons NASA's Pluto-Kuiper Belt Mission |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/ |accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

As of 2011, American scientists are concerned that exploration beyond the Asteroid Belt will hampered by a shortage of [[Plutonium-238]].{{update inline|date=August 2016}}<!-- Everyone seems to be talking about alternative propulsion tech now? -->

===Orbiters, rovers and landers===

In 1966, the Moon became the first Solar System body beyond Earth to be orbited by an [[Satellite#History of artificial satellites|artificial satellite]] (''[[Luna 10]]''), followed by Mars in 1971 (''[[Mariner 9]]''), Venus in 1975 (''[[Venera 9]]''), Jupiter in 1995 (''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]''), the asteroid [[433 Eros]] in 2000 (''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]''), Saturn in 2004 (''[[Cassini–Huygens]]''), and Mercury and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] in 2011 (''[[MESSENGER]]'' and ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' respectively). ''Dawn'' is orbiting the asteroid–dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] as of 2015.

The first probe to [[landings on other planets|land on another Solar System body]] was the [[Soviet space program|Soviet]] ''[[Luna 2]]'' probe, which impacted the Moon in 1959. Since then, increasingly distant planets have been reached, with probes landing on or impacting the surfaces of Venus in 1966 (''[[Venera 3]]''), Mars in 1971 (''[[Mars 3]]'', although a fully successful landing didn't occur until ''[[Viking 1]]'' in 1976), the asteroid [[433 Eros]] in 2001 (''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]''), and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] (''[[Huygens probe|Huygens]]'') and the comet [[Tempel 1]] (''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'') in 2005. The ''Galileo'' orbiter also dropped a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere in 1995; because Jupiter has no physical surface, it was destroyed by increasing temperature and pressure as it descended.

To date, only two worlds in the Solar System, the Moon and Mars, have been visited by [[Rover (space exploration)|mobile rovers]]. The first robotic rover to visit another celestial body was the Soviet ''[[Lunokhod 1]]'', which landed on the Moon in 1970. The first to visit another planet was [[Sojourner (rover)|Sojourner]], which travelled 500 metres across the surface of Mars in 1997. The only manned rover to visit another world was NASA's [[Lunar rover]], which traveled with Apollos [[Apollo 15|15]], [[Apollo 16|16]] and [[Apollo 17|17]] between 1971 and 1972.

== Crewed exploration ==
[[File:Astronaut Owen Garriott Performs EVA During Skylab 3 - GPN-2002-000065.jpg|thumb|[[Owen Garriott]] on an Earth orbit EVA, 1973]]
Crewed exploration of the Solar System ended in 1972.  The first human being to reach space (defined as an [[Kármán line|altitude of over 100 km]]) and to orbit Earth was [[Yuri Gagarin]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[cosmonaut]] who was launched in ''[[Vostok 1]]'' on April 12, 1961.  The first human to walk on the surface of another Solar System body was [[Neil Armstrong]], who stepped onto the [[Moon]] on July 21, 1969 during the ''[[Apollo 11]]'' mission; five more Moon landings occurred through 1972.  The United States' reusable [[Space Shuttle]] flew 135 missions between 1981 and 2011.  Two of the five shuttles were destroyed in accidents. 

The first orbital [[space station]] to host more than one crew was [[NASA]]'s [[Skylab]], which successfully held three crews from 1973 to 1974.  True human settlement in space began with the Soviet space station [[Mir]], which was continuously occupied for close to ten years, from 1989 to 1999.  Its successor, the [[International Space Station]], has maintained a continuous human presence in space since 2001.  In 2004, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] announced the [[Vision for Space Exploration]], which called for a replacement for the aging Shuttle, a return to the Moon and, ultimately, a crewed mission to Mars.
