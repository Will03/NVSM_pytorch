'''Shackleton Energy Company''' was formed in 2007 in [[Del Valle, Texas|Del Valle]], [[Texas]] to build equipment and technologies necessary for [[mining]] the [[Moon]].  Shackleton Energy was a subsidiary of Piedra-Sombra Corporation<ref name=sa20070115>{{cite web |title=Stone Aerospace Advocates Commercial Mining of the Moon |url=http://www.stoneaerospace.com/news-/news-mining-moon.php |date=2007-01-15 |publisher=Stone Aerospace |accessdate=2012-03-07 |quote=Shackleton Energy Company (SEC) [is] a wholly owned subsidiary of Piedra-Sombra Corporation}}</ref> until March 2011, when it was incorporated as an independent C-corporation in the State of Texas.<ref>[https://ourcpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/servlet/cpa.app.coa.CoaGetTp?Pg=tpid&Search_Nm=shackleton%20energy%20company%20&Button=search&Search_ID=32043752800 Window on State Government].  Certification of Account Status.  Retrieved: 7 March 2012.</ref>

==Plans==
Shackleton intends to undertake lunar [[prospecting]]. According to their website, they originally stated that they would place a team on the moon within eight years. They have now removed many of those dates from their website<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release Removed|url=http://www.shackletonenergy.com/SECPressRelease11092011.pdf}}</ref> after meeting no milestones and failing to secure funding.

The company plans to develop an "industrial [[astronaut]] corps" that would select individuals who have many of the characteristics of previous explorers—such as [[Ernest Shackleton]], [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]].<ref name=ss20121214c>[http://www.thespaceshow.com/detail.asp?q=1914 Shackleton Energy's cislunar economic development plans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105032615/http://www.thespaceshow.com/detail.asp?q=1914 |date=2013-01-05 }} David Livingston interview with James Keravala, ''The Space Show'', 14 December 2012, at 1:22:35–1:23:50, accessed 2013-01-03.</ref> They further state that they plan to have humans stationed on the Moon by March 2021<ref>http://www.shackletonenergy.com/program</ref>

==Rationale==
In the belief that significant reserves of [[Lunar ice|ice]] will be located, the company hopes to establish a network of "[[propellant depot|refueling service stations]]" in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) and on the Moon to process and provide fuel and consumables for commercial and government customers.<ref name=ieee200906>[http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/mining-the-moon Mining the Moon: How the extraction of lunar hydrogen or ice could fuel humanity's expansion into space], ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'', June 2009, accessed 2011-01-05.</ref> Shackleton hopes to build a fuel-processing operation on the lunar surface and in [[propellant depot]]s in LEO.  Their equipment would be designed to melt the ice and [[Water purification|purify]] the water, "[[electrolyze]] the water into gaseous [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], and could condense the gases into liquid hydrogen and [[liquid oxygen]] and also process them into [[hydrogen peroxide]], all of which could be used as [[rocket fuel]]s. Should other volatiles like [[ammonia]] or [[methane]] be discovered, they, too, would be processed into fuel, fertilizer, and other useful products."<ref name=ieee200906/>

The economics that would make the enterprise potentially [[economic profit|profitable]] are based on the relatively low costs of getting fuels and other consumables from the moon into low Earth orbit, because "such a haul requires just 1/14th to 1/20th of the fuel it takes to bring material up from Earth."<ref name=ieee200906/>

==Failed crowdfunding==
Shackleton began a {{currency|1.2|USD}} million crowdfunding campaign in November 2011 for seed funding, working with [[crowdfunding]] partner [[RocketHub]].<ref name=ps20111109>{{cite news |last=Messier|first=Doug |title=Shackleton Energy Company Launches Plan for First Lunar Mining Operation |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2011/11/09/exclusive-shackleton-energy-company-launches-plan-for-first-lunar-mining-operation/ |accessdate=2011-11-10 |newspaper=Parabolic Arc |date=2011-11-09 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.shackletonenergy.com/SECPressRelease11092011.pdf "Humans to Return to the Moon by 2019"], ''Shackleton Energy Company'', 09 November 2011. Retrieved on 10 November 2011.</ref> At the end of the fund raising period, only $5,517 was raised of the $1.2 million (0.46%) they hoped for.<ref>[http://rockethub.com/projects/3822-shackleton-energy-company-propellant-depots "Project: Shackleton Energy Company Propellant Depots], Rockethub, Retrieved on 16 January 2012.</ref>

==Project phasing==
Shackleton originally planned a phased project through 2020.<ref name=ss20121214a>[http://www.thespaceshow.com/detail.asp?q=1914 Shackleton Energy's cislunar economic development plans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105032615/http://www.thespaceshow.com/detail.asp?q=1914 |date=2013-01-05 }} David Livingston interview with James Keravala, ''The Space Show'', 14 December 2012, at 55:25–57:40, accessed 2012-12-22.</ref> Their plans were funding dependent on a raise in early 2013. However, funding was not secured. There have been no updates as to their progress.

# Systems planning and enterprise planning were to happen between 2012 and 2014. 
# [[Rover (space exploration)|Robotic precursor missions]], lasting two to three years, were planned to "identify and characterize the nature, composition and locations of the optimum ice concentrations at the [[Peary (crater)|north]] and [[Lunar south pole|south pole]] craters".<ref name=ss20121214a/>  [[Lunar rover|Surface operations]] and [[Exogeology|surface]] [[assay]]s with Shackleton equipment will complement the parallel [[List of current and future lunar missions|NASA and international missions]].  Projected to begin as early as 2014.
# Establish prototyping and engineering infrastructure in LEO to test the interchangeable modules that are intended for later use for production.  planned to concurrently start in 2014.
# Establish production-scale equipment and [[Space transport|transport vehicles]], both in LEO and on the surface of the Moon.  Once the lunar polar base has been confirmed and the equipment is landed, human teams will follow to monitor and operate the facility for the extraction of water ice.

==Legal regime==
Although the requisite legal regime to enable the ice mining technology does not exist,<ref name="SSI_SM14a_20101109">[http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/10752525 Moon, Mars, Asteroids: Where to Go First for Resources?] SSI-TV video archive, recorded on November 9, 2010, 74:37, panel discussion held during the Space Studies Institute's Space Manufacturing 14 conference in California.
