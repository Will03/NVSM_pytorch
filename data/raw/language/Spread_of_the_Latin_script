{{About|the geographic history of the Latin script|the typographic and orthographic history of the Latin script|history of the Latin script|the history of the Latin language|history of Latin}}
This article discusses the geographic '''spread of the Latin script''' throughout history, from its archaic beginnings in [[Latium]] to the dominant [[writing system]] on [[Earth]] in [[modernity]].

The Latin letters' ancestors are found in the [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and ultimately [[Phoenician alphabet]]. As the [[Roman Empire]] expanded in [[late antiquity]], the Latin script and [[Latin|language]] spread along with its conquests, and remained in use in [[Italy]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and Western Europe after the [[Western Roman Empire]]'s disappearance. During the early and high [[Middle Ages]], the script was spread by [[Christianisation|Christian missionaries]] and rulers, replacing earlier writing systems on the [[British Isles]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Northern Europe]].

In the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[first wave of European colonization|first wave of European colonisation]] saw the adoption of Latin alphabets primarily in the [[Americas]] and [[Australia]], whereas [[sub-Sahara Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Pacific]] were Latinised in the period of [[New Imperialism]]. Realising that Latin was now the most widely used script on Earth, the [[Bolsheviks]] made efforts to develop and establish Latin alphabets for all languages in the lands they controlled in [[Eastern Europe]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[Central Asia]]. However, after the [[Soviet Union]]'s first three decades, these were gradually abandoned in the 1930s in favour of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. Some post-Soviet [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-majority states decided to reintroduce the Latin script in the 1990s after the 1928 example of [[Turkey]]. In the early 21st century, non-Latin writing systems were still only prevalent in most parts of the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] and former Soviet regions, most countries in [[Indochina]], South and East Asia, [[Ethiopia]] and some [[Balkan]] countries in Europe.  

== Protohistory ==
[[File:Masiliana tablet.svg|thumb|The [[Marsiliana]] tablet (c. 700 BCE), containing the earliest known Etruscan [[abecedarium]].]]
The Latin script originated in [[Archaic period in classical antiquity|archaic antiquity]] in the [[Latium]] region in [[central Italy]]. It is generally held that the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], one of many [[Italic peoples|ancient Italic tribes]], adopted the western variant of the [[Greek alphabet]] in the 7th century BCE<ref name="Kamusella418-9">{{Cite book |last=Kamusella |first=Tomasz |date=2008 |title=The Politics of Language and Nationalism in Modern Central Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzkWDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA418 |location=Houndmills |publisher=Springer |pages=418–419 |isbn=9780230583474 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref> from [[Cumae]], a [[Magna Graecia|Greek colony]] in [[southern Italy]]&nbsp;– making the early Latin alphabet one among several [[Old Italic alphabets]] emerging at the time. The early Latin script was heavily influenced by the then regionally dominant [[Etruscan civilization]];<ref name="Etruscans">Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Etrusken. §2.

== Antiquity ==
Along with the Latin language, the Latin writing system spread first spread over the [[Italian Peninsula]] with the rise of the [[Roman Republic]], especially after 350 BCE. For example, the region of [[Umbria]] seems to have switched from its own script in the 2nd century BCE to Latin in the 1st.<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Umbrië. §1. Geschiedenis". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.</ref> Next were the lands surrounding the Western [[Mediterranean Sea]]: Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]], [[Numidia]], [[Hispania]], and [[Gallia Transalpina]]. This continued during the early period of expansion of the [[Roman Empire]] (c. 27 BCE – 117 CE) in regions such as [[Illyria]], [[Rhaetia]], [[Noricum]], [[Dacia]], [[Gaul]], [[Belgica]], western [[Germania]], and [[Britannia]]. The eastern half of the Empire, including [[Greece]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Levant]], and [[Egypt]], continued to use [[Greek language|Greek]] as a [[lingua franca]], but Latin was widely spoken in the western half, and as the western [[Romance languages]] evolved out of Latin, they continued to use and adapt the Latin alphabet.<ref name="Kamusella418-9"/> Despite the loss of the Latin-speaking Western provinces, the [[Byzantine Empire]] maintained Latin as its legal language, under 6th-century emperor [[Justinian I]] producing the vast [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] that would have a major impact on Western European legal history from c. 1100 to 1900.<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Corpus Iuris Civilis".</ref> The Germanic peoples that invaded and gradually settled the Western Roman Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries, most notably the [[Franks]] (first as the [[Merovingian script]], later the [[Carolingian minuscule]]), adopted the Latin script and spread it further.

== Middle Ages ==
=== Latin Christianisation of Western, Central and Northern Europe ===
[[File:CarolingianMinuscule.jpg|thumb|Example of [[Carolingian minuscule]] from a 10th-century manuscript.]]
With the spread of [[Western Christianity]] during the [[Middle Ages]], the Latin alphabet was gradually adopted by the peoples of [[Northern Europe]] who spoke [[Insular Celtic languages|Celtic languages]] (displacing the [[Ogham]] alphabet since the 5th century)<ref name="Kamusella418-9"/> or [[Germanic languages]] (displacing earlier [[Runic alphabet]]s since the 8th century)<ref name="Kamusella418-9"/> or [[Baltic languages]], as well as by the speakers of several [[Uralic languages]], most notably [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. The Latin script was introduced to Scandinavia in the 9th century, first in Denmark.<ref name="Kamusella418-9"/> It reached Norway during the [[Christianization of Scandinavia#Norway|11th-century Christianisation]], but in two different forms: the [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Insular script]] in Western Norway and the Carolingian minuscule in Eastern Norway.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Flom |first=George T. |date=1915 |title=On the earliest history of the Latin script in Eastern Norway |jstor=40914943 |journal=Publications of the Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study |publisher=[[Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study]] |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=92–106}}</ref>

=== Slavic languages ===
The Latin script also came into use for writing the [[West Slavic languages]] and several [[South Slavic languages]] such as [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]],<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Kroatië. §5. Geschiedenis". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.</ref> as the people who spoke them adopted [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. The speakers of [[East Slavic languages]] generally adopted [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] along with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]]. The [[Serbian language]] has come to use both scripts, whilst the Southeastern Slavic [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] languages have maintained Cyrillic only.

== Early modern period ==
As late as 1500, the Latin script was limited primarily to the languages spoken in [[Western Europe|Western]], [[Northern Europe|Northern]], and [[Central Europe]], Iberia and Italy. The [[Orthodox Christian]] Slavs of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]] mostly used [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and the Greek alphabet was in use by Greek-speakers around the eastern Mediterranean. The [[Arabic script]] was widespread within Islamdom, both among [[Arab]]s and non-Arab nations like the [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesians]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], and [[Turkic peoples]], as well as amongst [[Arab Christians]]. Most of the rest of Asia used a variety of [[Brahmic family|Brahmic alphabets]] or the [[Chinese script]].

Since the 15th and especially 16th centuries, the Latin script has spread around the world, to the [[Americas]], [[Oceania]], and parts of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] (until about 1880 mostly limited to the coastal areas), and the Pacific with European colonisation, along with the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] languages.

=== Americas ===
In an effort to Christianise and 'civilise' the [[Mayans]], the Roman Catholic bishop [[Diego de Landa]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatán|Yucatán]] ordered the burning of most [[Maya codices]] in July 1562, and with it the near destruction of the [[Maya script|Mayan hieroglyphic script]]. He then rewrote the history of the Mayans in Spanish, and the Mayan language was romanised, leading to an enormous loss in culture.<ref name="Andresen"/>

Latin letters served as the basis for the forms of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] developed by [[Sequoyah]] in the late 1810s and early 1820s; however, the sound values are completely different.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Southeast Asia and Pacific ===
The Latin script was introduced for many [[Austronesian languages]], including the [[languages of the Philippines]] and the [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language]]s, replacing earlier Arabic and indigenous Brahmic alphabets.

During the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule on Formosa]] (1624–1662), the island currently known as [[Taiwan]], the [[Siraya language]] was given a [[Sinckan Manuscripts|Sinckan Latin alphabet]] by the Dutch, which lasted until the 19th century.

== 19th century ==
=== Africa ===
The [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881–1914), meaning the rapid occupation, colonisation and annexation of inland Africa by European powers, went hand in hand with the spread of literacy amongst native Africans, as the Latin script was introduced where there were other writing systems or none. Until the early 19th century, the [[Berbers|Berber peoples]] in North Africa had two systems: originally [[Tifinagh]], and, following the spread of Islam, the [[Arabic script]] as well.<ref name="choice">{{cite journal| last = Larbi| first = Hsen| title = Which Script for Tamazight, Whose Choice is it ?| journal = Amazigh Voice (Taghect Tamazight)| volume = 12| issue = 2| year = 2003| publisher = Amazigh Cultural Association in America (ACAA)| location = New Jersey| url = http://www.tamazgha.fr/Which-Script-for-Tamazight-Whose-Choice-is-it,359.html| accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> French colonists, particularly missionaries and army linguists, developed a [[Berber Latin alphabet]] to make communication easier, especially for the [[Kabyle people]] in [[French Algeria]]. Since no great body of Berber literature existed, and the colonisers greatly helped improve literacy rates, the romanisation received much support, more so after Algerian independence (1962) when the French-educated Kabyle intelligentsia began to stimulate the transition and especially since the establishment of a standard transcription for Kabylie in 1970. Similar French attempts to latinise the Arabic language met much more resistance, were unsuccessful and eventually abandoned.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Souag |first=Lameen |year=2004 |title=Writing Berber Languages: a quick summary |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050730075554/http://www.geocities.com/lameens/tifinagh/ |archivedate=2005-07-30 |publisher=L.

=== Romania ===
As a [[Romance language]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] continued to be written in Latin script until the [[Council of Florence]] in 1439.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Descriptio_Moldaviae#CAPUT_V_-_DE_LITTERIS_MOLDAVORUM |date=1714 |title=Descriptio_Moldaviae |publisher=La.wikisource.org |accessdate=2014-09-14}}</ref> Increasingly influenced by [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Russia]] as the Greek [[Byzantine Empire]] declined and was gradually conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] had begun promoting the Slavic [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. In the 19th century, the [[Romanians]] returned to the Latin alphabet under the influence of [[nationalism]]. The linguist [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]] first proposed a simplified version of Cyrillic in 1829, but in 1838, he introduced a mixed alphabet containing 19 Cyrillic and 10 Latin letters, and an [i] and [o] that could be both. This 'transitional orthography' was widely used until the official adoption of a completely Latin Romanian alphabet in [[Wallachia]] (1860) and [[Moldavia]] (1863), that were gradually united since 1859 to become the [[Kingdom of Romania]] in 1881. Romanian intellectuals in [[Transylvania]], then still part of [[Austria-Hungary]], and scholars in Wallachia-Moldavia agreed to cleanse the language from all non-Latin elements (Greek, Magyar, Slavic, and Ottoman), and to emulate French wherever needed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kamusella |first=Tomasz |date=2008 |title=The Politics of Language and Nationalism in Modern Central Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzkWDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA209 |location=Houndmills |publisher=Springer |page=209 |isbn=9780230583474 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref>

=== Russian Empire ===
{{double image|right|Auksa altorius latin.jpg|140|Auksa altorius cirillics.jpg|135|The [[Lithuanian press ban]] in action: two issues of the same popular prayer book. The Latin left one was illegal, the right Cyrillic one was legal and paid for by the government.}}
Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (r. 1826–1855) of the [[Russian Empire]] introduced a policy of [[Russification]], including Cyrillisation. From the 1840s on, Russia considered introducing the Cyrillic script for spelling the [[Polish language]], with the first school books printed in the 1860s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cyrylica nad Wisłą|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/806286-Cyrylica-nad-Wisla.html|website=Rzeczpospolita|language=Polish|date=2012}}</ref> The imperial government's attempts failed, however: the Polish population put up a tough resistance, as it saw its language as expressed in its Latin alphabet as a source of national pride, and threatened to rebel if it were to be abolished.<ref name="Andresen110"/>

The initially successfully enacted [[Lithuanian press ban]] (1865–1904) outlawed the use of Latin script, whilst encouraging writing Lithuanian texts in Cyrillic. Resistance grew as time went on: [[Lithuanian book smugglers|Lithuanian books were smuggled]] into the country, mainly from [[Lithuania Minor]] in [[East Prussia]]. Although the Russian authorities tried to seize them, they could not stop the rapid increase in forbidden titles from crossing the border. The Lithuanian ban, lifted in 1904, is widely felt to have stimulated the Lithuanian national movement and embracing the Latin script, rather than discouraging it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lithuania/History#toc37338 |title=Lithuania – History – Russian Rule |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref>

=== Vietnam ===

A [[romanization]] of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] was codified in the 17th century by the French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] (1591–1660), based on works of the early 16th-century [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese missionaries]] Gaspar do Amaral and António Barbosa.<ref name="Andresen">{{Cite book |last1=Andresen |first1=Julie Tetel |last2=Carter |first2=Phillip M. |date=2016 |title=Languages in the World: How History, Culture, and Politics Shape Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uolxBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA106 |location= |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=106 |isbn=9781118531280 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref> This [[Vietnamese alphabet]] (''chữ quốc ngữ'' or "national script") was gradually expanded from its initial domain in Christian writing to become more popular among the general public, which had previously used [[Chu nom|Chinese-based characters]].

During the [[French Indochina|French protectorate]] (1883–1945), colonial rulers made an effort to educate all Vietnamese, and a simpler writing system was found more expedient for teaching and communication with the general population. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that the romanized script came to predominate written communication.<ref name="Andresen"/> To further the process, Vietnamese written with the alphabet was made obligatory for all public documents in 1910 by issue of a decree by the French Résident Supérieur of the [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|protectorate of Tonkin]] in northern Vietnam.

== 20th century ==
=== Albanian ===
{{main|Albanian alphabet}}
[[Albanian language|Albanian]] used a [[Albanian alphabet|variety of writing systems]] since its first attestation in the 12th century, especially Latin (in the north), Greek (in the south), Ottoman and Arabic (favoured by many Muslims). Attempts at standardisation were made throughout the 19th century, since 1879 led by the [[Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings]], culminating in the 1908 [[Congress of Manastir]] when a single Latin script, Bashkimi, was chosen for the whole language. Although the newly adopted Albanian Latin alphabet symbolised a break with Ottoman rule, some Islamist Kosovo Albanians objected strongly against it, preferring to maintain the Arabic script that was found in the [[Quran]], which they held sacred. However, nationalists maintained the Latin alphabet was 'above religion' and therefore also acceptable to non-Islamic and secular Albanians; they would win the argument.<ref name="Kostovicova">{{Cite book |last=Kostovicova |first=Denisa |date=2005 |title=Kosovo: The Politics of Identity and Space |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L562PiBM6GEC&pg=PA32 |location= |publisher=Psychology Press |page=32 |isbn=9780415348065 |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>

=== Serbo-Croatian ===
[[File:Latinalphabet Former Yugoslavia 2008.png|thumb|350px|A map showing the expansion of the use of Latin script in areas of former [[Yugoslavia]], primarily amongst Croatians and Slovenes ([[Roman Catholic]]s), [[Bosniaks]] (Bosnian [[Muslim]]s) and Kosovars (Albanian Muslims). [[Cyrillic]] texts are dominant in areas primarily inhabited by Serbs, Montenegrins, and Macedonians ([[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians). This cultural boundary has existed since the dichotomy of the [[Greek East and Latin West]].]]
{{See also|Gaj's Latin alphabet}}
Croatian linguist [[Ljudevit Gaj]] devised a uniform Latin alphabet for Croatian in 1835, while in 1818, Serbian linguist [[Vuk Karadžić]] had developed a [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]]. In the first half of the 19th century, the [[Illyrian movement]] to unite all Southern Slavs (Yugoslavs) culturally, and perhaps also politically, was quite strong, and efforts were made to create a unified literary language that would set the standard for all Yugoslav dialects. The [[Vienna Literary Agreement]] (March 1850) between writers from Croatia, Serbia and one from Slovenia was the most significant attempt, where some basic rules were agreed upon. In the 1860s, Vuk's orthography gained acceptance in Serbia, while a [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] was founded in 1866 in [[Zagreb]] and the first 'Serbo-Croatian' grammar book by [[Pero Budmani]] was published in Croatia in 1867. In 1913, [[Jovan Skerlić]] proposed a compromise for a single writing system and dialect to create true language unity.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Greenberg |first=Robert D. |date=2004 |title=Language and Identity in the Balkans: Serbo-Croatian and Its Disintegration |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lNjHgr3QioC&pg=PA55 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=55 |isbn=9780191514555 |accessdate=7 June 2017}}</ref> After [[World War I]], political unity was realised in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], but an agreement on scriptural unity for its population was never reached. The post-war [[Titoist]] [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] made another attempt at achieving linguistic unity, but the 1954 [[Novi Sad Agreement]] only managed to get equality of Latin and Cyrillic, and an obligation for all citizens to learn both alphabets. With the return of ethnic nationalism in the 1980s, the two again became heavily associated with particular variants of the Serbo-Croatian language and thus with national identities. Exacerbated by the [[Yugoslav Wars]] that led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, nationalists on all sides resumed insisting Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin were distinct languages in their own right, undermining the project of Serbo-Croatian linguistic unity.

The [[Bosnian language]] was originally primarily expressed in the Cyrillic-type ''[[Bosnian Cyrillic|Bosančica]]'' since the 11th century (originally alongside the older ''[[Glagolitic script|Glagoljica]]''), but it was gradually driven extinct in the 18th century after the Ottoman introduction of the [[Perso-Arabic script]]-type ''[[Arebica]]'' (15th–20th century).<ref name="Čuvalo">{{Cite book |last=Čuvalo |first=Ante |date=2010 |title=The A to Z of Bosnia and Herzegovina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nfk4nP_fp04C&pg=PA26 |location=Lanham |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=26 |isbn=9780810876477 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref> Eventually, most Bosnians adopted the Croatian-derived ''[[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Latinica]]'' or Latin script –originally introduced by the Catholic [[Franciscans]]<ref name="Čuvalo"/>– in the course of the 20th century, standardised in the 1990s.

[[File:Ataturk-September 20, 1928.jpg|thumb|[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] introduced the Latin script in Turkey in 1928.]]
In 1928, as part of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s reforms, the new [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] adopted the [[Turkish Latin alphabet]] for the [[Turkish language]], replacing a modified Arabic alphabet.<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Turkse talen. Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.</ref>

In the 1930s and 1940s, the majority of [[Kurds]] replaced the Arabic script with two Latin alphabets. Although the only official Kurdish government, the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] in northern [[Iraq]], uses an Arabic alphabet for public documents, the Latin Kurdish alphabet remains widely used throughout the region by the majority of [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] speakers, especially in Turkey and Syria. 

During the late 20th century [[decolonisation]], [[Pan-Arabism]] and [[Arab nationalism]] expressed themselves in anti-Western tendencies, including hostility towards the Latin script. It was banned in some places such as Libya after [[Moammar Gaddafi]]'s [[1969 Libyan coup d'état|1969 coup]], in favour of exclusive Arabic script.

=== Kazakhstan ===
[[File:Kazakhstan’s transition to the Latin script.webm|thumb|Kazakhstan’s transition to the Latin script was welcomed by linguists and expats ([[Kazakh TV]], November 2018).]]
Unlike its Turkic neighbours, Kazakhstan did not move towards Latinisation after obtaining statehood in 1991. This was motivated by pragmatic reasons: the government was wary to alienate the country's large Russian-speaking minority, and due to the economic crisis in the early 1990s, a transition was considered fiscally unfeasable at the time.<ref name="Bartlett">{{Cite news |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav090407.shtml |title=Kazakhstan: Moving Forward with Plan to Replace Cyrillic with Latin Alphabet |author=Paul Bartlett |work=[[EurasiaNet]] |publisher=[[Open Society Foundations]] |date=3 September 2007 |accessdate=7 June 2017}}</ref>

In 2006, President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] requested the Ministry of Education and Science to examine the experiences of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, which had all switched to Latin letters in the 20th century. The ministry reported in the summer of 2007 that a six-step plan, based primarily on the Uzbekistan model, should be implemented over a 12-to-15-year period at the cost of about $300&nbsp;million. Aside from integrating Kazakhstan into the global economy, officials have also argued it would help the development of a Kazakh national identity separate from Russia.<ref name="Bartlett"/> In 2007, Nazarbayev said the transformation of the Kazakh alphabet from Cyrillic to Latin should not be rushed, as he noted: "For 70 years, the Kazakhstanis read and wrote in Cyrillic. More than 100 nationalities live in our state. Thus we need stability and peace. We should be in no hurry in the issue of alphabet transformation".<ref>[http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&id=158363 Kazakhstan should be in no hurry in Kazakh alphabet transformation to Latin: Nazarbayev, Kazinform, December 13, 2007]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916024719/http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&id=158363 |date=16 September 2016 }}</ref>

In 2015, the [[Kazakh government]] announced that the Latin script would replace Cyrillic as the writing system for the [[Kazakh language]] by 2025.<ref>[http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2741711 Kazakh language to be converted to Latin alphabet – MCS RK]. Inform.kz (30 January 2015). Retrieved on 2015-09-28.</ref> In 2017, Nazarbayev said that "By the end of 2017, after consultation with academics and representatives of the public, a single standard for the new [[Kazakh alphabet]] and script should be developed." Education specialists are to be trained to teach the new alphabet and provide textbooks beginning in 2018. The romanisation policy is intended to modernise Kazakhstan and increase international cooperation.<ref name="Welle">{{Cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/kazakhstan-spells-out-plans-for-alphabet-swap/a-38407769 |title=Kazakhstan spells out plans for alphabet swap |work=Deutsche Welle |date=4 January 2017 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref>

==== Bulgaria ====
{{See also|Romanization of Bulgarian}}
In 2001, Austrian slavistics professor Otto Kronsteiner recommended that Bulgaria adopt the Latin script in order to facilitate the country's accession to the [[European Union]]. This caused such a scandal that the [[Veliko Tarnovo University]] revoked the honorary degree it had previously awarded him (for supporting the Bulgarian viewpoint on the [[Macedonian language]]).<ref name="Detrez"/> For many [[Bulgaria]]ns, the Cyrillic alphabet has become an important component of their national identity, and great pride is taken in having introduced Cyrillic into the EU in 2007.<ref name="Detrez">{{Cite book |last=Detrez |first=Raymond |date=2014 |title=Historical Dictionary of Bulgaria |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hywaBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA147 |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=147–148 |isbn=9781442241800 |accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref><ref name="EUCyrillic">With the [[accession of Bulgaria to the European Union]] on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the [[European Union]], following the Latin and Greek scripts. {{cite pressrelease|author1=Leonard Orban|title=Cyrillic, the third official alphabet of the EU, was created by a truly multilingual European|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-07-330_en.pdf|format=PDF|website=Europe.eu|accessdate=28 November 2018|date=24 May 2007}}</ref>

However, in digital communication using computers and writing [[email]]s and [[SMS]], the Latin script has been proposed to replace the Cyrillic. A Bulgarian Latin alphabet, the so-called ''shlyokavitsa'', is already often employed for convenience for emails and SMS messages. Ciphers are used to denote Bulgarian sounds that cannot be represented with a single Latin character (for example, a "[[4]]" represents a "[[ч]]" because they look alike and the Bulgarian word for the cardinal number four, чѐтири ''čѐtiri'', starts with a "ч").<ref name="Detrez"/>

==== Kosovo ====
{{See also|Minority languages of Kosovo}}
Despite initial resistance from Islamist Kosovo Albanians (who favoured the Arabic script) against the 1908 [[Congress of Manastir]]'s resolution to adopt the Latin script to write the Albanian language in, [[Kosovo Albanians]] came to accept the Albanian Latin alphabet over the course of the early 20th century.<ref name="Kostovicova"/> [[Literacy]] amongst Kosovo Albanians increased from 26% in 1948 to 96.6% (men) and 87.5% (women) in 2007.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Robert |first=Elsie |date=2010 |title=Historical Dictionary of Kosovo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pg-aeA-nUeAC&pg=PA90#v=onepage&q&f=false |location=Plymouth |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=90–92 |isbn=9780810874831 |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> The [[Kosovo Serbs]] have followed the practice of Cyrillic/Latin digraphia in the Republic of Serbia and continued to use both alphabets after the [[Kosovo War]] (1998–9) and the [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence]].<ref name="Hajdari">{{Cite news |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/cyrillic-documents-causes-confusion-in-kosovo-parliament |title=Kosovo Parliament Rejects Serb Minister’s Cyrillic |author=Una Hajdari |work=Balkan Insight |date=28 July 2015 |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> Article 2 of the 2006 Law on the Use of Languages states that “Albanian and Serbian and their alphabets are official languages of Kosovo and have equal status in Kosovo institutions,” but fails to specify which alphabets these are, as neither Latin nor Cyrillic is mentioned.<ref name="Hajdari"/> This has often led the (ethnic Albanian-dominated) Kosovo authorities to exclusively use the [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Serb(o-Croatian) Latin alphabet]] in its communication with the Serb minority, as it does with the country's other five officially recognised minorities, especially the [[Bosniaks]] [[Bosnian language|whose language]] is very similar to Serbian, but always written in Latin.<ref name="Hajdari"/> Although Kosovo Serbs may use either or both alphabets in everyday life, some claim they've got the right to demand the authorities to communicate with them in their preferred alphabet, and accuse the government of violating the law.<ref name="Hajdari"/> The present attitudes of the Kosovar authorities have raised concerns over the Latinisation of the Kosovo Serbs against their will, while the government maintains it respects the legal rights of minorities.<ref name="Hajdari"/>

==== Kyrgyzstan ====
{{See also|Kyrgyz alphabets}}
Adopting the Latin script for the [[Kyrgyz language]] has been the subject of discussions in [[Kyrgyzstan]] since attaining independence in the 1990s. However, unlike in the other Turkic-dominated former Soviet republics in Central Asia, the issue did not become prominent until its great neighbour Kazakhstan in September 2015 and April 2017 confirmed its previous annoucements to Latinise the closely related [[Kazakh language]]. Before then, the largely Russian-speaking elite of the country saw no reason to, nor did it seek to endanger its good-standing political and economic relations with the Russian Federation. Amongst others, deputy Kanybek Imanaliyev advocated a shift to Latin for 'the development of contemporary technology, communication, education and science.' On the other hand, due to financial constraints, he proposed to postpone the transition to the 2030s or even 2040s. Because Russia is still a very important financial supporter of Kyrgyzstan, other experts agreed it would be unwise for Bishkek to make a move that would culturally alienate Moscow. President [[Almazbek Atambayev]] stated in October 2017 that the country would not Latinise any time soon.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Goble |first=Paul |date=12 October 2017 |title=Moscow Bribes Bishkek to Stop Kyrgyzstan From Changing to Latin Alphabet |url=https://jamestown.org/program/moscow-bribes-bishkek-stop-kyrgyzstan-changing-latin-alphabet/ |journal=[[Eurasia Daily Monitor]] |volume=14 |issue=128 |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref>

==== Macedonia ====
{{See also|Languages of the Republic of Macedonia|Romanization of Macedonian}}
The [[Macedonian language]] in [[Macedonian alphabet|its Cyrillic alphabet]] has been the official language of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] throughout the country and in its foreign relations since 1991. However, since the [[2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|2001 Albanian insurgency]] was ended by the [[Ohrid Agreement]], the [[Constitution of Macedonia]] has been amended (Amendment V) to mandate the co-official use of the six minority languages and their respective alphabets in municipalities in which more than 20% of an ethnic minority resides. The six minority languages – Albanian, Turkish, Romani, Serbian, Bosnian and Aromanian – are (with the exception of Serbian) always officially written in Latin script in the municipalities where their speakers constitute a significant minority or even majority.<ref>[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Macedonia_2011?lang=en Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia] See amendment V</ref> In addition, Macedonian is occasionally written in Latin, especially in advertising.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Evans |first=Thammy |date=2012 |title=Macedonia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10Tjsyz69UwC&pg=PA49 |location= |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |page=49–50 |isbn=9781841623955 |accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref>

==== Montenegro ====
{{See also|Controversy over ethnic and linguistic identity in Montenegro|Montenegrin alphabet}}
There is ongoing discussion in [[Montenegro]] about how to call the [[Montenegrin language|"Montenegrin" language]], which is [[Comparison of standard Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian|mutually intelligible with the other standardised versions]] of [[Serbo-Croatian]]: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]. These debates focus on the perceived linguistic differences between Montenegrin and related variants, but also on national and political identification. Montenegro practices [[digraphia]]: there are two official [[Montenegrin alphabet]]s, one Latin and one Cyrillic. In electoral campaigns after 2000, especially the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|2006 independence referendum]], Latin has come to symbolise closeness to Western countries, including Montenegro's historical ties to [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], and independence from Serbia; on the other hand, Cyrillic is taken to signify unity with Serbia and closeness to the East.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kolstø |first=Pål |date=2016 |title=Strategies of Symbolic Nation-building in South Eastern Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qY7eCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT169 |publisher=Routledge |page=169 |isbn=9781317049357 |accessdate=7 June 2017}}</ref> 

In general, proponents of calling the language "Montenegrin" – including the government – tend to favour the Latin script, whereas supporters of "Serbian" prefer Cyrillic.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lowen |first=Mark |title=Montenegro embroiled in language row |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=19 February 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8520466.stm |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref> In June 2016, an incident in which top students in primary and secondary schools for the first time since World War II received their "Luca" diplomas – named after [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš|Njegoš]]'s poem – printed in the Latin alphabet, sparked political controversy. The opposition [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]] (SNP) accused Education Minister [[Predrag Bošković]] of "persecuting Cyrillic" and discriminating against pupils who use this script. The SNP was unsuccessful in forcing the minister to resign.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegrin-opposition-alleges-cyrillic-script-discrimination-06-13-2016 |title=Montenegro Minister Accused of Undermining Cyrillic |author=Dusica Tomovic |work=Balkan Insight |date=14 June 2016 |accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref>

==== Serbia ====
{{See also|Romanization of Serbian}}
Under the [[Constitution of Serbia]] of 2006, Cyrillic script is the only one in official use.<ref>[http://www.srbija.gov.rs/cinjenice_o_srbiji/ustav_odredbe.php?id=101 Article 10] of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia ([http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/akta/ustav/ustav_1.asp English version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314172414/http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/akta/ustav/ustav_1.asp |date=14 March 2011 }})</ref> Nonetheless the Latin script is widely used. In May 2017, Minister of Culture and Information {{ill|Vladan Vukosavljević (politician)|lt=Vladan Vukosavljević|sr|Владан Вукосављевић (министар)}} proposed several measures to better support the Cyrillic script, which was "in danger of falling into disuse". He said there wasn't any kind of conspiracy going on against the Cyrillic alphabet, but rather that the spirit of the times, historical circumstances and the decades-long process of globalisation had gradually made Latin the world's dominant script. "Especially young people in Serbia are now mostly turning to Latin characters because of the media, the Internet and the logos of world [[brand]]s."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://informer.rs/vesti/politika/334105/vukosavljevic-cirilica-ugrozena-moramo-spasiti |title=VUKOSAVLJEVIĆ: Ćirilica je ugrožena, moramo je spasiti! |trans-title=VUKOSAVLJEVIĆ: Cyrillic is endangered, we've got to save her! |work=[[Informer (newspaper)|Informer]] |date=5 June 2017 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=sr}}</ref> In August 2018, the Ministry of Culture proposed a law to that effect, obliging government institutions to use Cyrillic under the threat of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], and setting up a Council for the Serbian Language to implement this suggested language policy. The ministry claimed that indifference towards which script to use was not “a culturally responsible position”, and complained that some people had come to “use the Latin script as a symbol of [their] openness and [[Europeanism|European affiliation]]”, arguing that Cyrillic was also one of the [[Languages of the European Union#Writing systems|European Union's official writing systems]]<ref name="EUCyrillic"/> and that "the EU is a [[Motto of the European Union|community of peoples with their peculiarities]]."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-proposes-law-changes-to-halt-cyrillic-s-decline-08-01-2018 |title=Serbia Proposes Law Changes to Halt Cyrillic’s Decline |author=Maja Zivanovic |work=Balkan Insight |date=2 August 2018 |accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref>

==== Tatarstan (Russia) ====
{{See also|Tatar alphabet}}
In 1999, the Russian [[Tatarstan|Republic of Tatarstan]] proposed to convert the Turkic [[Tatar language]] to Latin script in order to bring it into the modern world of the [[Internet]]. There was opposition from both inside and outside Tatarstan, with Tatars arguing it would threaten their national identity and to sever their ties to the past. The Russian [[State Duma]] rejected the proposal. President [[Vladimir Putin]] said that a Tatar move from Cyrillic to Latin would 'threaten the unity of the [[Russian Federation]]'. In 2002, Putin therefore enacted a law that made the use of Cyrillic mandatory for all languages in all autonomous republics of Russia.<ref name="Andresen110"/>

==== Ukraine ====
{{See also|Romanization of Ukrainian|Ukrainian Latin alphabet}}
In March 2018, Foreign Minister of Ukraine [[Pavlo Klimkin]] called for a discussion on the introduction of the Latin alphabet in parallel usage with the traditional Cyrillic one in Ukraine. He did so in response to the suggestion of Polish historian Ziemowit Szczerek. Ukraine's parliamentary committee on science and education responded, with first deputy chair Oleksandr Spivakovsky saying that today in Ukraine there are other, more important issues to work on than a transition to the Latin script. Similarly, philology professor Oleksandr Ponomariv was skeptical whether a full transition to Latin would benefit Ukraine, but did not rule out the parallel use of two alphabets. He pointed to the fact that the [[Serbian language]] is also expressed in both a Cyrillic and a Latin alphabet.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.unian.info/society/10058741-klimkin-welcomes-discussion-on-switching-to-latin-alphabet-in-ukraine.html |title=Klimkin welcomes discussion on switching to Latin alphabet in Ukraine |author= |work=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] |date=27 March 2018 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>
