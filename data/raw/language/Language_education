'''Language education''' refers to the process and practice of acquiring a second or foreign language. It is primarily a branch of [[applied linguistics]], however can be considered an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field.<ref>Spolsky, B., & Hult, F.M. (Eds.). (2008). ''Handbook of educational linguistics.'' Malden, MA: Blackwell. </ref><ref>Hult, F.M., (Ed.). (2010). ''Directions and prospects for educational linguistics.''  New York: Springer.</ref> There are four main learning categories for language education: communicative competencies, proficiencies, [[cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural experiences]], and multiple literacies.<ref>Phillips, J. K. (2007). Foreign Language Education: Whose Definition?. ''The Modern Language Journal'', ''91''(2), 266–268. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 00267902</ref>

== Need ==
Increasing [[globalization]] has created a great need for people in the workforce who can communicate in multiple languages. Common languages are used in areas such as trade, tourism, international relations, technology, media, and science. Many countries such as [[Korea]] (Kim Yeong-seo, 2009), [[Japan]] (Kubota, 1998) and [[China]] (Kirkpatrick & Zhichang, 2002) frame education policies to teach at least one foreign language at the primary and secondary school levels. However, some countries such as [[India]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], and the [[Philippines]] use a second official language in their governments. According to [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] (2010), China has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning, especially [[the English language]].

==History==

===Ancient to medieval period===
The need to learn foreign languages is as old as human history itself. In the Ancient Near East, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] was the language of diplomacy, as in the [[Amarna letters]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Scoville |first1=Priscila |title=Amarna Letters |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Amarna_Letters/ |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=3 November 2018}}</ref> For many centuries, [[Latin]] was the dominant language of education, commerce, religion, and government in much of Europe, but it was displaced for many purposes by French, Italian, and English by the end of the 16th century. [[John Amos Comenius]] was one of many people who tried to reverse this trend. He wrote a complete course for learning Latin, covering the entire school curriculum, culminating in his ''Opera Didactica Omnia'', 1657.

In this work, Comenius also outlined his theory of [[language acquisition]]. He is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about methods for teaching languages. He held that language acquisition must be allied with sensation and experience. Teaching must be oral. The schoolroom should have models of things, or else pictures of them. He published the world's first illustrated children's book, ''[[Orbis sensualium pictus]]''. The study of Latin gradually diminished from the study of a living language to a mere subject in the school curriculum. This decline demanded a new justification for its study. It was then claimed that the study of Latin developed intellectual ability, and the study of Latin grammar became an end in and of itself.

"Grammar schools" from the 16th to 18th centuries focused on teaching the grammatical aspects of Classical Latin. Advanced students continued grammar study with the addition of rhetoric.<ref name="Richards">{{cite book |title=Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching |last=Richards|first=Jack C. |author2=Theodore S. Rodgers |year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge UK |ISBN=0-521-00843-3 }}</ref>

===18th century===
The study of modern languages did not become part of the curriculum of European schools until the 18th century. Based on the purely academic study of Latin, students of modern languages did much of the same exercises, studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences. Oral work was minimal, and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language. This tradition-inspired method became known as the [[grammar translation|grammar-translation method]].<ref name="Richards"/>

===19th and 20th centuries===
{{globalize/US|date=November 2010}}
[[File:Sweet Henry.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Henry Sweet]] was a key figure in establishing the [[applied linguistics]] tradition in language teaching]]
Innovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century. It led to a number of different and sometimes conflicting methods, each claiming to be a major improvement over the previous or contemporary methods. The earliest applied linguists included Jean Manes ca, [[Heinrich Gottfried Ollendorff]] (1803–1865), [[Henry Sweet]] (1845–1912), [[Otto Jespersen]] (1860–1943), and [[Harold E. Palmer|Harold Palmer]] (1877–1949). They worked on setting language teaching principles and approaches based on linguistic and psychological theories, but they left many of the specific practical details for others to devise.<ref name="Richards"/>

The history of foreign-language education in the 20th century and the methods of teaching (such as those related below) might appear to be a history of failure. Very few students in U.S. universities who have a foreign language as a major attain "minimum professional proficiency". Even the "reading knowledge" required for a PhD degree is comparable only to what second-year language students read, and only very few researchers who are native English speakers can read and assess information written in languages other than English. Even a number of famous linguists are monolingual.<ref name="Diller">{{cite book |title=The Language Teaching Controversy |last=Diller |first=Karl Conrad |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House |location=Rowley, Massachusetts |isbn=0-912066-22-9 }}</ref>

However, anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find, leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of most language programs. This tends to make the research of [[second language acquisition]] emotionally charged. Older methods and approaches such as the [[grammar translation method]] and the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]] are dismissed and even ridiculed, as newer methods and approaches are invented and promoted as the only and complete solution to the problem of the high failure rates of foreign language students.

Most books on language teaching list the various methods that have been used in the past, often ending with the author's new method. These new methods are usually presented as coming only from the author's mind, as the authors generally give no credence to what was done before and do not explain how it relates to the new method. For example, descriptive linguists{{Who|date=December 2009}} seem to claim unhesitatingly that there were no scientifically based language teaching methods before their work (which led to the [[audio-lingual method]] developed for the U.S. Army in World War II). However, there is significant evidence to the contrary. It is also often inferred or even stated that older methods were completely ineffective or have died out completely, though in reality even the oldest methods are still in use (e.g. the [[Maximilian Berlitz|Berlitz]] version of the direct method). Proponents of new methods have been so sure that their ideas are so new and so correct that they could not conceive that the older ones have enough validity to cause controversy. This was in turn caused by emphasis on new scientific advances, which has tended to blind researchers to precedents in older work.<ref name="Diller"/>(p.&nbsp;5)

There have been two major branches in the field of language learning, the empirical and theoretical, and these have almost completely separate histories, with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another. Examples of researchers on the empiricist side are Jesperson, Palmer, and [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who promote mimicry and memorization with pattern drills. These methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and drilling. In its most extreme form, language learning is seen as much the same as any other learning in any other species, human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species.

On the theoretical side are, for example, Francois Gouin, M.D. Berlitz, and [[Emile B. De Sauzé]], whose rationalist theories of language acquisition dovetail with linguistic work done by [[Noam Chomsky]] and others. These have led to a wider variety of teaching methods, ranging from the grammar-translation method and Gouin's "series method" to the direct methods of Berlitz and De Sauzé. With these methods, students generate original and meaningful sentences to gain a functional knowledge of the rules of grammar. This follows from the rationalist position that man is born to think and that language use is a uniquely human trait impossible in other species. Given that human languages share many common traits, the idea is that humans share a [[universal grammar]] which is built into our brain structure. This allows us to create sentences that we have never heard before but that can still be immediately understood by anyone who understands the specific language being spoken. The rivalry between the two camps is intense, with little communication or cooperation between them.<ref name="Diller"/>

=== 21st century ===
Over time, language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world. In some countries, such as the United States, language education (also referred to as World Languages) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as English, Maths and Science.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/21stCenturySkillsMap/p21_worldlanguagesmap.pdf|title=American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages|website=www.actfl.org|access-date=2016-05-18}}</ref>

In some countries, such as Australia, it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to [[Languages Other Than English|LOTE]] or Language Other Than English. In the majority of English-speaking education centers, French, Spanish and German are the most popular languages to study and learn. English As A Second Language is also available for students whose first language is not English and they are unable to speak it to the required standard.

==Teaching foreign language in classrooms==
{{main article|Methods of teaching foreign languages}}

[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|right|[[High school]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] taught as a second [[language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]
Language education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized '''[[language school]]'''. There are many methods of teaching languages. Some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used; still others have a small following, but offer useful insights.

While sometimes confused, the terms "approach", "method" and "technique" are hierarchical concepts.

An '''approach''' is a set of assumptions about the nature of language and language learning, but does not involve procedure or provide any details about how such assumptions should be implemented into the classroom setting. Such can be related to [[second language acquisition theory]].

There are three principal "approaches":
# The structural view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning (e.g. grammar).
# The functional view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish a certain function, such as requesting something.
# The interactive view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This approach has been fairly dominant since the 1980s.<ref name="Richards"/>

A '''method''' is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned, and should be based upon a selected approach. In order for an approach to be translated into a method, an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning, how the content is to be selected and organized, the types of tasks to be performed, the roles of students, and the roles of teachers.
# Examples of structural methods are [[grammar translation]] and the [[audio-lingual method]].
# Examples of functional methods include the oral approach / situational language teaching.
# Examples of interactive methods include the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], the series method, [[communicative language teaching]], [[language immersion]], the [[Silent Way]], [[Suggestopedia]], the [[Natural Approach]], [[Tandem language learning|Tandem Language Learning]], [[Total Physical Response]], [[Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling]] and [[Dogme language teaching]].

A '''technique''' (or strategy) is a very specific, concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective. Such are derived from the controlling method, and less directly, from the approach.<ref name="Richards"/>

==Online and self-study courses==
Hundreds of languages are available for self-study, from scores of publishers, for a range of costs, using a variety of methods.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Self-Study Courses: Comparison, Problems, Ratings|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref> The course itself acts as a teacher and has to choose a methodology, just as classroom teachers do.

===Audio recordings and books===
Audio '''recordings''' use native speakers, and one strength is helping learners improve their accent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Good Accents|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/2/category/accent/1.html|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Some recordings have pauses for the learner to speak. Others are continuous so the learner speaks along with the recorded voice, similar to learning a song.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shadowing Step by Step|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=130bOvRpt24|work=ForeignLanguageExpertise.com|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref>

Audio recordings for self-study use many of the methods used in classroom teaching, and have been produced on records, tapes, CDs, DVDs and websites.

Most audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner's own language. An alternative is to use sound effects to show meaning of words in the target language.<ref>''Amazing Hear-Say'', by Donald Rivera, Penton Overseas Inc., {{ISBN|1-56015-677-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-350-0}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-353-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-349-7}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-351-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://aaa.Lang1234.com | title=Lessons for Beginners in English, mp3 | date=15 August 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> The only language in such recordings is the target language, and they are comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.

Language '''books''' have been published for centuries, teaching vocabulary and grammar. The simplest books are phrasebooks to give useful short phrases for travelers, cooks, receptionists,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hhh.Lang1234.com | title=Workers and Guests Have Different Language Needs in a Hotel | date=20 April 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> or others who need specific vocabulary. More complete books include more vocabulary, grammar, exercises, translation, and writing practice.

Also, various other "language learning tools" have been entering the market in recent years.

===Internet and software===
'''Software''' can interact with learners in ways that books and audio cannot:

# Some software records the learner, analyzes the pronunciation, and gives feedback.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scoring Your Pronunciation|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/3/post/2012/08/pronunciation.html|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>
# Software can present additional exercises in areas where a particular learner has difficulty, until the concepts are mastered.
# Software can pronounce words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures<ref>{{cite web|title=Language Guide|url=http://Languageguide.org|publisher=Language Guide|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref> instead of oral explanations. The only language in such software is the target language. It is comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.

'''Websites''' provide various services geared toward language education. Some sites are designed specifically for learning languages:

# Some software runs on the web itself, with the advantage of avoiding downloads, and the disadvantage of requiring an internet connection.
# Some publishers use the web to distribute audio, texts and software, for use offline. For example, various travel guides, for example Lonely Planet, offer software supporting language education.
# Some websites offer learning activities such as quizzes or puzzles to practice language concepts.
# [[Language exchange]] sites connect users with complementary language skills, such as a native Spanish speaker who wants to learn English with a native English speaker who wants to learn Spanish. Language exchange websites essentially treat ''knowledge of a language'' as a commodity, and provide a marketlike environment for the commodity to be exchanged. Users typically contact each other via chat, [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], or email. Language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at [[language school]]s. Language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency, fluency, colloquial vocabulary acquisition, and vernacular usage, rather than formal grammar or writing skills. Across Australasia, 'Language Perfect' - an online vocabulary learning site- is frequently used as it enables teachers to monitor students' progress as students gain a "point" for every new word remembered. There is an annual international Language Perfect contest held in May.

Many other websites are helpful for learning languages, even though they are designed, maintained and marketed for other purposes:

# All countries have websites in their own languages, which learners elsewhere can use as primary material for study: news, fiction, videos, songs, etc. In a study conducted by the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]], it was noted that the use of technology and media has begun to play a heavy role in facilitating language learning in the classroom. With the help of the internet, students are readily exposed to foreign media (music videos, television shows, films) and as a result, teachers are taking heed of the internet's influence and are searching for ways to combine this exposure into their classroom teaching.<ref>{{cite web|title=What We Can Learn From Foreign Language Teaching In Other Countries|url=http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0106pufahl.html|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref>
# Translation sites let learners find the meaning of foreign text or create foreign translations of text from their native language.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/ | title=Google Translate | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bing.com/translator | title=Bing Translator | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>
# [[Speech synthesis]] or text to speech (TTS) sites and software let learners hear pronunciation of arbitrary written text, with pronunciation similar to a native speaker.
# Course development and [[learning management system]]s such as [[Moodle]] are used by teachers, including language teachers.
# [[Web conferencing]] tools can bring remote learners together; e.g. [[Elluminate Live]].
# Players of computer games can practice a target language when interacting in [[massively multiplayer online game]]s and [[virtual worlds]]. In 2005, the virtual world [[Second Life]] started to be used for foreign language tuition, sometimes with entire businesses being developed.<ref>{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Study and teach in Second Life |url=http://www.its-teachers.com/destinations/second_life/second_life03.asp |work=iT's Magazines |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Apprendre une langue dans un monde virtuel |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0,36-935560,0.html |work=Le Monde |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}</ref> In addition, Spain’s language and cultural institute [[Instituto Cervantes]] has an "island" on Second Life.
Some Internet content is free, often from government and nonprofit sites such as [[Bbc Online#Knowledge and Learning|BBC Online]], Book2, [[Foreign Service Institute]], with no or minimal ads. Some are ad-supported, such as newspapers and YouTube. Some require a payment.

==Learning strategies==
[[Language learning strategies]] have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition.

===Listening as a way of learning===
Clearly listening is used to learn, but not all language learners employ it consciously. Listening to understand is one level of listening but focused listening<ref>Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/improving-listening-skills/ focused listening]</ref> is not something that most learners employ as a strategy.

===Reading as a way to learn===
Many people read to understand but the strategy of reading text to learn grammar and discourse styles can also be employed.<ref>Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/learning-grammar/ strategy of reading]</ref>

===Learning vocabulary===

Translation and rote memorization have been the two strategies that have been employed traditionally. There are other strategies that also can be used such as guessing, based on looking for contextual clues, spaced repetition with a use of various apps, games and tools (e.g. [http://www.duolingo.com DuoLingo], [http://www.LingoMonkey.com LingoMonkey] and [http://www.vocabularystickers.com Vocabulary Stickers]). Knowledge about how the brain works can be utilized in creating strategies for how to remember words.<ref>Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/how-to-remember-vocabulary/ How to remember vocabulary]</ref>

===Code switching===
{{Main article|Code-switching}}
Code switching, that is, changing between languages at some point in a sentence or [[utterance]], is a commonly used communication strategy among language learners and bilinguals. While traditional methods of formal instruction often discourage code switching, students, especially those placed in a language immersion situation, often use it. If viewed as a [[study skills|learning strategy]], wherein the student uses the target language as much as possible but reverts to their native language for any element of an utterance that they are unable to produce in the target language (as, e.g., in [[Wolfgang Butzkamm]]'s concept of enlightened monolingualism), then it has the advantages that it encourages fluency development and motivation and a sense of accomplishment by enabling the student to discuss topics of interest to him or her early in the learning process—before requisite vocabulary has been memorized. It is particularly effective for students whose native language is English, due to the high probability of a simple English word or short phrase being understood by the conversational partner.<ref>Butzkamm, Wolfgang (1998). "Code-Switching in a Bilingual History Lesson: The Mother Tongue as a Conversational Lubricant". ''International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism'' 1:2, pp. 81–99.</ref>

==Teaching strategies==

===Blended learning===
{{Main article|Blended learning}}
Blended learning combines face-to-face teaching with [[distance education]], frequently electronic, either computer-based or web-based. It has been a major growth point in the ELT (English Language Teaching) industry over the last ten years. {{when|date=May 2016}}

Some people, though, use the phrase 'Blended Learning' to refer to learning taking place while the focus is on other activities. For example, playing a card game that requires calling for cards may allow blended learning of numbers (1 to 10).

===Skill teaching===
When talking about language skills, the four basic ones are: listening, speaking, reading and writing. However, other, more socially based skills have been identified more recently such as summarizing, describing, narrating etc. In addition, more general learning skills such as study skills and knowing how one learns have been applied to language classrooms.<ref name="Holden">{{cite book |title=English language teaching |last=Holden |first=Susan |author2=Mickey Rodgers  |year=1998 |publisher=DELTI |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-6820-12-4 }}</ref>

In the 1970s and 1980s, the four basic skills were generally taught in isolation in a very rigid order, such as listening before speaking. However, since then, it has been recognized that we generally use more than one skill at a time, leading to more integrated exercises.<ref name="Holden"/> Speaking is a skill that often is underrepresented in the traditional classroom. This is due to the fact that it is considered harder to teach and test. There are numerous texts on teaching and testing writing but relatively few on speaking.

More recent textbooks stress the importance of students working with other students in pairs and groups, sometimes the entire class. Pair and group work give opportunities for more students to participate more actively. However, supervision of pairs and groups is important to make sure everyone participates as equally as possible. Such activities also provide opportunities for peer teaching, where weaker learners can find support from stronger classmates.<ref name="Holden"/>

===Sandwich technique===
{{main article|Sandwich technique}}
In [[second language acquisition|foreign language teaching]], the '''sandwich technique''' is the oral insertion of an [[idiom|idiomatic translation]] in the [[mother tongue]] between an unknown phrase in the [[second language|learned language]] and its repetition, in order to convey meaning as rapidly and completely as possible. The mother tongue equivalent can be given almost as an aside, with a slight break in the flow of speech to mark it as an intruder.

When modeling a dialogue sentence for students to repeat, the teacher not only gives an oral mother tongue equivalent for unknown words or phrases, but repeats the foreign language phrase before students imitate it: L2 => L1 => L2. For example, a [[German language|German]] teacher of [[English language|English]] might engage in the following exchange with the students:

: Teacher: "Let me try - lass mich versuchen - let me try."
: Students: "Let me try."

===Mother tongue mirroring===
{{main article|Mother tongue mirroring}}
Mother tongue mirroring is the adaptation of the time-honoured technique of [[literal translation]] or word-for word translation for pedagogical purposes. The aim is to make foreign constructions salient and transparent to learners and, in many cases, spare them the technical jargon of grammatical analysis. It differs from [[literal translation]] and [[interlinear text]] as used in the past since it takes the progress learners have made into account and only focuses upon a specific structure at a time. As a didactic device, it can only be used to the extent that it remains intelligible to the learner, unless it is combined with a normal idiomatic translation. This technique is seldom referred to or used these days.

===Back-chaining===
{{main article|Back-chaining}}
Back-chaining is a technique used in teaching oral language skills, especially with [[polysyllabic]] or difficult words.<ref name="ue">"Backchaining." ''Glossary.'' Retrieved April 4, 2009, from http://www.usingenglish.com/glossary/backchaining.html</ref> The teacher pronounces the last syllable, the student repeats, and then the teacher continues, working backwards from the end of the word to the beginning.<ref>"Backchaining." ''Teaching English.'' Retrieved April 4, 2009, from http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/knowledge-wiki/backchaining</ref>

For example, to teach the name ‘[[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]' a teacher will pronounce the last syllable: ''-sky,'' and have the student repeat it. Then the teacher will repeat it with ''-sorg-'' attached before: ''-sorg-sky,'' and all that remains is the first syllable: ''Mus-sorg-sky.''

==By region==
{{main article|Language education by region}}

Practices in language education may vary by region however the underlying understandings which drive it are fundamentally similar. Rote repetition, drilling, memorisation and grammar conjugating are used the world over. Sometimes there are different preferences [[Methods of teaching foreign languages|teaching methods]] by region. [[Language immersion]] is popular in some European countries, but is not used very much in the [[United States]], in [[Asia]] or in [[Australia]].

The languages being learned differ; in the [[United States]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the most popular language to be learned, whereas the most popular languages to be learned in [[Australia]] are [[Italian language|Italian]] and Mandarin Chinese.

==Language study holidays==
{{See also|Language school}}
An increasing number of people are now combining [[tourism|holiday]]s with language study in the native country. This enables the student to experience the target culture by meeting local people. Such a holiday often combines formal lessons, cultural excursions, leisure activities, and a [[homestay]], perhaps with time to travel in the country afterwards. Language study holidays are popular across Europe (Malta & UK being the most popular because almost everyone speaks English as a first language) and Asia due to the ease of transportation and variety of nearby countries. These holidays have become increasingly more popular in Central and South America in such countries as Guatemala, Ecuador and [[ACUPARI|Peru]]. As a consequence of this increasing popularity, several international language education agencies have flourished in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelweek.ca/news/travel-agents-missing-profitable-language-travel-holidays-sprachcaffe/ |title=Travel agents missing out on profitable language travel holidays – Sprachcaffe |publisher=TravelWeek|date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}</ref>


With the increasing prevalence of international business transactions, it is now important to have multiple languages at one's disposal. This is also evident in businesses outsourcing their departments to Eastern Europe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Minority language education==

===Minority language education policy===
The principal policy arguments in favor of promoting minority language education are the need for multilingual workforces, intellectual and cultural benefits and greater inclusion in global information society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/community |title=Community Languages in Higher Education: Towards realising the potential |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Sachdev |first=I |author2=McPake, J  |year=2008 |pages=76 |publisher=Routes into Languages }}</ref> Access to education in a minority language is also seen as a human right as granted by the [[European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]], the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and the [[UN Human Rights Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2004/minority_education/edminlang |title=The right to education and minority language |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=de Varennes |first=Fernand |year=2004 |publisher=EUMAP: EU Monitoring and Advocacy Program Online Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404121819/http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2004/minority_education/edminlang |archivedate=4 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>Hult, F.M.
