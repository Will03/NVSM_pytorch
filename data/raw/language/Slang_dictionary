A '''slang dictionary''' is a [[reference book]] containing an [[Alphabetical order|alphabetical]] list  of [[slang]], which is [[vernacular]] [[vocabulary]] not generally acceptable in formal usage, usually including information given for each word, including meaning, pronunciation, and [[etymology]]. It can provide definitions on a range of slang from more mundane terms (like "[[Glossary of English language idioms derived from baseball#rain check|rain check]]" or "[[bob and weave]]") to obscure sexual practices. Such works also can include words and phrases arising from different [[dialect]]s and [[argot]]s, which may or may not have passed into more common usage. They can also track the changing meaning of the terms over time and space, as they migrate and mutate. This makes them of interest to a variety of people, from [[Oral history|oral historians]], to [[etymologist]]s, to the casual browser.

== Famous slang dictionaries ==

===17th and 18th centuries===
Slang dictionaries have been around hundreds of years. ''The Canting Academy, or Devil's Cabinet Opened'' was a 17th-century slang dictionary, written in 1673 by [[Richard Head]], that looked to define [[thieves' cant]]. Other early slang dictionaries include ''[[A New Dictionary of the Terms Ancient and Modern of the Canting Crew]]'', first published circa 1698, and [[Francis Grose]]'s ''A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'', first published in 1785.  Grose's work was arguably the most significant English-language slang dictionary until [[John Camden Hotten]]'s 1859 ''[[A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words]]''.<ref>[[Tony Thorne]] (2000) "Slang and the Dictionary".</ref>

===Modern times===
In recent years, dictionaries with a more academic focus have tried to bring together etymological studies in an attempt to provide definitive guides to slang while avoiding problems arising from [[folk etymology]] and [[false etymology]]. The study of slang is now taken seriously by academics, especially [[Lexicography|lexicographers]] like the late [[Eric Partridge]], devoting their energies to the field and publishing on it, including producing slang dictionaries.

===Examples===
* ''[[Green's Dictionary of Slang]]'' (by [[Jonathon Green]], Chambers, {{ISBN|978-0-550-10440-3}}), 2010 comprising three volumes: A-E; F-O; P-Z
* ''Chambers Slang Dictionary'' (by [[Jonathon Green]], [[Chambers Harrap|Chambers Harrap Publishers]], {{ISBN|978-0-550-10439-7}}), 2008 previously ''Cassell Dictionary of Slang'' ([[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell Reference]], 1998; last edition 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-304-36636-1}})
*''[[Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English]]'' (by [[Eric Partridge]] and Paul Beale, [[Routledge]], 2002, {{ISBN|0-415-29189-5}})
*''The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang'' (by John Ayto and [[John Simpson (lexicographer)|John Simpson]], [[Oxford University Press]], 2005, {{ISBN|0-19-861052-1}})

===Vulgar slang===
There have also been a subsequent amount of [[tongue-in-cheek]] efforts which tend to focus on the more vulgar slang terms:
*''[[Roger's Profanisaurus]] Rex: The Ultimate Swearing Dictionary'' (third edition, ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'', 2005, {{ISBN|0-7522-2812-9}})

The [[Urban Dictionary]] relies on user contributions, which can introduce both humour and inaccuracies. It has also been published in book form:

*''Urban Dictionary: Fularious Street Slang Defined'' (by Aaron Peckham, [[Andrews McMeel Publishing|Andrews McMeel]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-7407-5143-3}})
