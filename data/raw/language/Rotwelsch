'''Rotwelsch''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁoːtvɛlʃ|lang}}) or '''Gaunersprache''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡaʊnɐʃpʁaːxə|lang}}, ''"[[wikt:Gauner#German|criminal]] [[wikt:Sprache#German|language]]"'') is a secret language, a [[Cant (language)|cant]] or [[Thieves' cant|thieves' argot]], spoken by covert groups primarily in southern [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]].{{clarify|date=October 2015}}

==Origin and development==
''Rotwelsch'' was formerly common among travelling craftspeople and [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrants]].  The language is built on a strong [[substratum]] of [[German language|German]], but contains numerous words from other languages, notably from various German [[dialect]]s, including [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], as well as from [[Romany language]]s, notably [[Sinte Romani|Sintitikes]]. There are also significant influences from [[Judæo-Latin]], the ancient [[Jewish language]] spoken in the [[Roman Empire]]. ''Rotwelsch'' has also played a great role in the development of the [[Yeniche language]]. In form and development, it closely parallels the commercial speech ("shopkeeper language") of German-speaking regions.

==Vocabulary==
Because of its development as a means of conveying information about goods and transactions, ''Rotwelsch'' has no terms for [[abstraction]]s. For example, it has no direct translations for the [[season]]s such as spring and autumn.{{contradict-inline|reason=aren't the translations in the next sentence?|date=September 2015}} Instead, it uses ''Bibberling'' (literally, "shiver-ling") and ''Hitzling'' (literally, "heat-ling") in place of season names.

Other vocabulary examples, compared to their German counterparts, include:
* ''Schokelmei'' = ''Kaffee'' (coffee)
* ''schenigeln'' = ''arbeiten'' (to work)
* ''Krauter'' = ''Chef eines Handwerkbetriebes'' (master artisan)
* ''Kreuzspanne'' = ''Weste'' (waistcoat)
* ''Wolkenschieber'' = ''Frisör'', ''Barbier'' (barber)
* ''Stenz'' = ''Wanderstock des Handwerksburschen'' ([[walking stick]])
* ''fechten'' = ''betteln'' (to beg)
* ''Platte machen'' = ''Unterkunft suchen'' (to seek lodging)
* ''Puhler'' = ''Polizist'' (policeman)

===From Feraru's "The 'United Ring' and Organized Crime in Berlin"===
* ''abfaßen'' = to arrest (literally 'to write out')
* ''acheln'' = to eat (from Hebrew)
* ''ackern'' = to go acquire; to go off the line (literally 'to till or cultivate')
* ''den Affen kaufen'' = to get drunk (literally 'to buy the ape')
* ''alle gehn'' = to be arrested; to vanish into thin air
* ''assern'' = to testify against someone, to 'betray' them
* ''aufmucken'' = to revolt against orders
* ''auftalgen'' = to hang (literally 'to grease up')
* ''der Getalgente'' = the hanged man
* ''balldowern'' = to spy out; to make inquiries about (perhaps from Hebrew ''Ba'al Davar'' = one who brings an accusation)
* ''ballmischpet'' = examining magistrate (from Hebrew ''Ba'al Mishpat'' = Master of Law)
* ''der Bau'' = the prison or penitentiary (literally 'the lodge')
* ''Bauer'' = a stupid simple-minded person (literally 'peasant' or 'farmer')
* ''begraben sein'' = to be hunted for a long time (literally 'to be buried')
* ''bei jom'' = by day (Hebrew ''yom'' = day)
* ''bei leile'' = by night (Hebrew ''laila'' = night)
* ''der Bello'' = the prison toilet

* ''die Bim'' = a small bell (from ''bimmel'')

==Current status==
Variants of Rotwelsch, sometimes toned down, can still be heard among travelling craftspeople and [[funfair]] showpeople as well as among vagrants and beggars.  Also, in some southwestern and western locales in Germany, where travelling peoples were settled, many Rotwelsch terms have entered the vocabulary of the vernacular, for instance in the municipalities of [[Schillingsfürst]] and [[Schopfloch, Bavaria|Schopfloch]].
A couple of Rotwelsch words have entered the colloquial language, for example, "aufmucken", "Bau", "berappen". "Baldowern" or "ausbaldowern" is very common in Berlin dialect; "Bombe" is still used in German prison jargon. "Bock haben" is also still used all around Germany. The [[Manisch]] dialect of the German city of [[Gießen]] is still used, although it was only spoken fluently by approximately 700-750 people in 1976.<ref>Hans-Günter Lerch, "Tschü lowi...Das Manische in Giessen", 1976/2005, Reprint Edition, page 22, {{ISBN|3-89687-485-3}}</ref>

==  Code ==
Josef Ludwig Blum from Lützenhardt (Black Forrest) wrote from war prison:

„[E]s grüßt Dich nun recht herzlich Dein Mann, viele Grüße an Schofel und Bock. Also nochmals viel Glück auf ein baldiges Wiedersehen in der schönen Heimat. Viele Grüße an Mutter u. Geschwister sowie an die Deinen.“

Bock and Schofel are persons? The control let pass the words.  This code words ''Schofel'' („bad“) and ''Bock'' („hunger“) change the meaning.<ref>{{citation|surname1=Christian Efing|title=Das Lützenhardter Jenisch: Studien zu einer deutschen Sondersprache |publisher=Harrassowitz|publication-place=Wiesbaden|year=2005|pages=74|isbn=3447052082|language=German|access-date=2014-12-12}}</ref>

==Rotwelsch in the arts==
A variant of Rotwelsch was spoken by some American [[organized crime|criminal groups]] in the 1930s and '40s, and harpist [[Zeena Parkins]]' 1996 album ''Mouth=Maul=Betrayer'' made use of spoken Rotwelsch texts.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r272034|pure_url=yes}} Proefrock, Stacia; Allmusic.com review of ''Mouth=Maul=Betrayer'']; URL accessed Jan 06, 2007</ref>

An example of Rotwelsch is found in Gustav Meyrink's ''[[The Golem (Meyrink)|Der Golem]]'' and reads as follows:
''An Beindel von Eisen recht alt.''
''An Stranzen net gar a so kalt.''
''Messinung, a' Räucherl und Rohn,''
''und immerrr nurr putzen.''
''Und stoken sich Aufzug und Pfiff,''
''und schmallern an eisernes G'süff.''
''Juch,''
''Und Handschuhkren, Harom net san.''<ref>http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Meyrink,+Gustav/Roman/Der+Golem/Punsch Transcript of Golem novel.</ref>
