[[File:English Bible translations.jpg|thumb|A sampling of the many English translations]]
Many attempts have been made to [[Bible translation|translate the Bible]] into Late Modern (''c.'' 1700–1900) and present-day (''c.'' 1900–) English.

The [[New Revised Standard Version]] is the version most commonly preferred by [[biblical scholars]].<ref>[http://courses.missouristate.edu/markgiven/rel102/bt.htm A Discussion of Bible Translations and Biblical Scholarship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904041222/http://courses.missouristate.edu/markgiven/rel102/bt.htm |date=2016-09-04 }}</ref> In the United States, 55% of survey respondents who read the Bible reported using the [[King James Version]] in 2014, followed by 19% for the [[New International Version]], with other versions used by fewer than 10%.<ref>[http://www.raac.iupui.edu/files/2713/9413/8354/Bible_in_American_Life_Report_March_6_2014.pdf The Bible in American Life]</ref>

==Development of Modern English Bible versions==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2007}}
The [[Wessex Gospels]] were the first translation of the four [[Gospel|Gospels]] in English without accompanying Latin text.<ref>G. W. Bromiley, D. M. Beegle, and W. M. Smith, “English Versions,” ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley, The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1979–1988), 83.</ref> The [[Authorized King James Version]] of 1611 was sporadically altered until 1769, but was not thoroughly updated until the creation of the [[Revised Version]] in 1885; it was not until the [[Revised Standard Version]] of 1952 (New Testament in 1948) that a rival to the KJV was composed, nearly 350 years after the KJV was first published. The RSV gained widespread adoption among the mainstream Protestant Churches in America and a Catholic Edition was released in 1962.  It was updated as the [[New Revised Standard Version]] in 1989.

In the late twentieth century, Bibles increasingly appeared that were much less literal in their approach to translation. In 1946, the [[New English Bible]] was initiated in the United Kingdom, intended to enable readers to better understand the King James Bible. In 1958, [[John Bertram Phillips|J. B. Phillips]] (1906–1982) produced an edition of the [[New Testament]] [[Epistles|letters]] in paraphrase, the ''Letters to Young Churches'', so that members of his youth group could understand what the New Testament authors had written. In 1966, ''[[Good News for Modern Man]]'', a non-literal translation of the New Testament, was released to wide acceptance.  Others followed suit. [[The Living Bible]], released in 1971, was published by its author [[Kenneth N. Taylor]], based on the literal [[American Standard Version]] of 1901. Taylor had begun because of the trouble his children had in understanding the literal (and sometimes archaic) text of the King James Bible. His work was at first intended for children, but was later positioned for marketing to high school and college students, as well as adults wishing to better understand the Bible. Like Phillips' version, the Living Bible was a dramatic departure from the [[King James Bible|King James version]].
 
Despite widespread criticism due to being a [[paraphrase]] rather than a translation, the popularity of [[The Living Bible]] created a demand for a new approach to translating the Bible into contemporary English called [[dynamic equivalence]], which attempts to preserve the meaning of the original text in a readable way. Realizing the immense benefits of a Bible that was more easily accessible to the average reader, and responding to the criticisms of the Living Bible, the [[American Bible Society]] extended the ''Good News for Modern Man'' to the [[Good News Bible]] (1976) by adding the Old Testament, in this more readable style. This translation has gone on to become one of the best selling in history. In 1996, a new revision of Taylor's Living Bible was published. This [[New Living Translation]] is a full translation from the original languages rather than a paraphrase of the Bible.

Another project aimed to create something in between the very literal translation of the [[King James Bible]] and the more informal [[Good News Bible]]. The goal of this was to create a Bible that would be scholarly yet not overly formal. The result of this project was the [[New International Version]] (1978). This version became highly popular in Evangelical Protestant circles.

The debate between the formal equivalence and dynamic (or 'functional') equivalence translation styles has increased with the introduction of [[Gender-neutral language|inclusive language]] versions. Various terms are employed to defend or attack this development, such as ''feminist'', ''gender neutral'', or ''gender accurate''. New editions of some previous translations have been updated to take this change in language into account, including the [[New Jerusalem Bible]] (1985), the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989), the [[Revised English Bible]] (1989), and [[Today's New International Version]] (2005). Some translations have approached the issue more cautiously, such as the [[English Standard Version]] (2001).

A further process that has assisted in greatly increasing the number of English Bible versions is the use of the Internet in producing virtual bibles, of which a growing number are beginning to appear in print – especially given the development of "[[print on demand]]".

Today, there is a range of translations ranging from the most literal, such as the ''[[Young's Literal Translation]]'' to the most free such as ''[[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]'' and ''[[The Word on the Street (book)|The Word on the Street]]''.

===Internet-based translations===
The [[New English Translation]] (or NET Bible) is a project to publish a translation of the Bible using the Internet. It is freely available and accompanied by extensive translator's notes. Another is [[The Work of God's Children Illustrated Bible]], which uses a collaborative [[MediaWiki]] website that interlinks the words of the Bible to articles and image galleries about the topic. The [[Open English Bible]] aims to create the first modern public domain English translation of the Bible, using an open-source process for corrections and modernizing verses.

In addition to the above Catholic English Bibles, all of which have an [[imprimatur]] granted by a Catholic [[bishop]], the authors of the Catholic Public Domain Version<ref>[http://www.sacredbible.org/catholic/version.htm Catholic Public Domain Version]</ref> of 2009 and the 2013 translation from the Septuagint by Jesuit priest Nicholas King<ref>http://www.nicholas-king.co.uk/</ref> refer to them as Catholic Bibles. These versions have not been granted an imprimatur, but do include the Catholic biblical canon of 73 books.

===Sacred Name translations===
These [[Sacred Name Bibles]] were all done with the specific aim of carrying into English the actual Name of God as they were in the originals. Most have been done by people from the [[Sacred Name Movement]]. They are distinguished by their policy of transliterating Hebrew-based forms for sacred names, such as "Yahweh", "YHWH", etc.

===Masoretic Text / Jewish translations===
{{Main| Jewish English Bible translations}}
Jewish translations follow the [[Masoretic Text]], and are usually published in bilingual editions with the Hebrew text facing the English translation. The translations often reflect traditional Jewish exegesis of the bible. As translations of the Masoretic bible, Jewish translations contain neither the [[apocrypha]] nor the Christian [[New Testament]].

===Simplified English Bibles===
There have been a number of attempts to produce a Bible that greatly simplifies the English. (Some of these versions are also listed in other categories: for example, the NIrV is also found under the NIV section). These are translations that are not necessarily a very dynamic translation, but go beyond simply everyday English into a restricted vocabulary set, often aimed at non-native speakers of English.
