'''Cockney Wanker''' is a character created by Graham Dury and Simon Thorpe<ref name="to">"[http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/10-funniest-londoners-2 10 funniest Londoners ]". ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]''. Retrieved 15 March 2014</ref><ref>Cook, William. "[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/nov/18/comedy All in the worst possible taste]". theguardian.com, 18 November 2004. Retrieved 15 March 2014</ref> in ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' based on a [[stereotype]]d male [[Cockney]]. Wanker speaks in [[Cockney rhyming slang|rhyming slang]] (often slang invented by the writers) and spends his days drinking and selling stolen or unworkable goods to passers-by from an [[East End of London|East End]] market stall. Another of Wanker's specialities is trading used cars. Playing upon the stereotype of the indigenous population of [[London]] being fantasists, Wanker often buys a car, sells it back to the same person, for the same amount of money, then declares the transaction to have been "A nice little earner!" He wears cheap [[gold]] jewellery or [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] [[bling]] and 'Laahndan' gangster dark glasses, and is often seen smoking a [[cigar]].

He is a [[Domestic violence|wife-beater]]<ref>von Busack, Richard.

Retrieved 15 March 2014</ref> and lifelong [[racist]]<ref>Trilling, 25</ref> who complains about "[[Ethnic slur#S|Sooties]]", yet respects [[Frank Bruno]]. He is established as a [[monarchist|royalist]], especially supportive of the [[Queen Mother]], spouting [[Conventional wisdom|received wisdom]] such as "Ninety Free she is. Ninety Free. Wahn the bladdy war for us she did!"

Wanker's appearance is based on a combination of a stereotypical London taxi driver and [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]'s<ref name="to" /> character [[Frank Butcher]] from ''[[EastEnders]]''.<ref>[[Stuart Maconie|Maconie, Stuart]]. "Pies and Prejudice: In search of the North". Random House, 2008. p. 23. {{ISBN|0-0919-3030-8}}</ref> His characterisation also draws elements from [[David Jason]]'s "[[Del Trotter]]" in ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''. Other characters in the strip closely resemble ''EastEnders'' characters, e.g. Shirl, his long suffering and battered wife ([[Kathy Beale]]) and Lou, Shirl's fearsome old-school East End mother ([[Lou Beale]]).
