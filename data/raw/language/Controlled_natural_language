'''Controlled natural languages''' ('''CNLs''') are subsets of [[natural language]]s that are obtained by restricting the grammar and vocabulary in order to reduce or eliminate [[ambiguity]] and complexity. Traditionally, controlled languages fall into two major types: those that improve readability for human readers (e.g. non-native speakers),
and those that enable reliable automatic [[Semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantic analysis]] of the language.

The first type of languages (often called "simplified" or "technical" languages), for example ASD Simplified Technical English, Caterpillar Technical English, IBM's Easy English, are used in the industry to increase the quality of technical documentation, and possibly simplify the (semi-)automatic translation of the documentation.
These languages restrict the writer by general rules such as "Keep sentences short", "Avoid the use of pronouns", "Only use dictionary-approved words", and "Use only the active voice".<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.mt-archive.info/CLT-2003-Obrien.pdf |title=Controlling Controlled English - An Analysis of Several Controlled Language Rule Sets | first = Sharon | last = O'Brien |year=2003 |booktitle=Proceedings of EAMT-CLAW }}</ref>

The second type of languages have a formal logical basis, i.e. they have a formal syntax and semantics, and can be mapped to an existing [[formal language]], such as [[first-order logic]]. Thus, those languages can be used as [[knowledge representation language]]s,<ref>Schwitter, Rolf. "[http://staff.um.edu.mt/mros1/cnl2010/TALKS/schwitter_tutorial.pdf Controlled natural languages for knowledge representation]." Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Posters. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2010.</ref> and writing of those languages is supported by fully automatic consistency and redundancy checks, [[query answering]], etc.
