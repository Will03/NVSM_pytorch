The study of the '''history of marketing''', as a discipline, is meaningful because it helps to define the baselines upon which change can be recognised and understand how the discipline evolves in response to those changes.<ref name=handbook>

Marketers tend to distinguish between the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought:

: (a) the ''history of marketing practice'' refers to an investigation into the ways that marketing has been practiced; and how those practices have evolved over time as they respond to changing socio-economic conditions
: (b) the ''history of marketing thought'' refers to an examination of the ways that marketing has been studied and taught

Although the history of marketing thought and the history of marketing practice are distinct fields of study, they intersect at different junctures.<ref name="Hollander et al. (2005)">

</ref> Marketing practitioners engage in innovative practices that capture the attention of marketing scholars who codify and disseminate such practices. At the same time, marketing academics often develop new research methods or theories that are subsequently adopted by practitioners. Thus developments in marketing theory inform marketing practice and vice versa. The history of marketing will remain incomplete if one disassociates academia from practitioners.<ref name="Hollander et al. (2005)" />

The publication, in 1960, of Robert Keith's article, "The Marketing Revolution", was a pioneering work in the study of the history of marketing practice.<ref>Keith, R.  J., "The Marketing Revolution," ''
Journal of Marketing,''  Vol. 24, No. 1; Jul 1959-Apr 1960, pp 35-38</ref> And, in 1976, the publication of Robert Bartel's book, ''The History of Marketing Thought,'' marked a turning-point in the understanding of how marketing theory evolved since it first emerged as a separate discipline around the turn of last century.<ref name="ReferenceA">Bartels, R., ''The History of Marketing Thought,'' Columbus, Ohio, Grid, 1976.</ref>

== Etymology==

According to etymologists, the term 'marketing' first appeared in dictionaries in the sixteenth century where it referred to the process of buying and selling at a market.<ref>Etymology Dictionary Online, http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=marketing</ref> The contemporary definition of 'marketing' as a process of moving goods from producer to consumer with an emphasis on sales and advertising first appeared in dictionaries in 1897.<ref>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/marketing#English</ref> The term, marketing, is a derivation of the Latin word, ''mercatus'' meaning market-place or merchant.<ref>Dictionary.com, http://www.dictionary.com/browse/marketing</ref>

Historians of marketing tend to fall into two distinct branches of marketing history - ''the history of marketing practice'' and ''the history of marketing thought.'' These branches are often deeply divided and have very different roots. The history of marketing practice is grounded in the management and marketing disciplines, while the history of marketing thought is grounded in economic and cultural history. This means that the two branches ask very different types of research questions and employ different research tools and frameworks.<ref>Berghoff, H., Scranton. P. and Spiekermann , U. (eds), ''The Rise of Marketing and Market Research: Worlds of Consumption,'' [German Historical Society],  NY, Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, p. 2</ref>

Historians of marketing have undertaken considerable investigation into the emergence of marketing practice, yet there is little agreement about when marketing first began.<ref>Enright, M., "Marketing and Conflicting Dates for its Emergence: Hotchkiss, Bartels, the ‘Fifties School’ and Alternative Accounts," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 18, 2002, pp  445-461</ref> Some researchers argue that marketing practices can be found in antiquity <ref>Dixon, D.F.,  "Medieval  Macromarketing  Thought," In ''Macromarketing,''George Fisk and Phillip White (eds), pp 59–69.

===Marketing in antiquity===

[[File:Garum Mosaik Pompeji.JPG|thumb|left|Mosaic showing garum container, from the house of Umbricius Scaurus of Pompeii. The inscription which reads "G(ari) F(los) SCO(mbri) SCAURI EX OFFI(CI)NA SCAURI" has been translated as "The flower of garum, made of the mackerel, a product of Scaurus, from the shop of Scaurus"]]

A number of studies have found evidence of advertising, branding, packaging and labelling in antiquity.<ref>Maran, J. and Stockhammer, P.W. (eds), ''Materiality and Social Practice: Transformative Capacities of Intercultural Encounters,'' Oxford, UK, Oxbow, 2012</ref><ref>Demirdjian, Z. S.,  "Rise and Fall of Marketing in Mesopotamia: A Conundrum in the Cradle of Civilization," In ''The Future of Marketing's Past: Proceedings of the 12th Annual Conference on Historical Analysis and Research in Marketing,'' Leighton Neilson (ed.), CA, Longman, Association for Analysis and Research in Marketing, 2005</ref>  Umbricius Scauras, for example, was a manufacturer of fish sauce (also known as [[garum]]) in Pompeii, circa 35 C.E. Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of [[amphora]] bearing his personal brand and quality claims. The mosaic comprises four different amphora, one at each corner of the atrium, and bearing labels as follows:<ref>Clarke, J. R. in Dobbins, J. J. and Foss, P. W., ''The World of Pompeii,'' Oxford, Routledge, 2008, p. 330; Curtis, R.I., "A Personalized Floor Mosaic from Pompeii," ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' Vol. 88, No. 4, 1984, DOI: 10.2307/504744, pp. 557-566, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/504744</ref>
: 1. G(ari) F(los) SCO[m]/ SCAURI/ EX OFFI[ci]/NA SCAU/RI   Translated as "The flower of garum, made of the mackerel, a product of Scaurus, from the shop of Scaurus"

: 4. LIQUAMEN/ OPTIMUM/ EX OFFICI[n]/A SCAURI    Translated as: "The best liquamen, from the shop of Scaurus"
The reputation of Scauras' fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the Mediterranean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern France.<ref>Curtis, R.I., "A Personalised Floor Mosaic from Pompeii," ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' Vol. 88, No. 4 (Oct., 1984), DOI: 10.2307/504744, pp. 557-566, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/504744</ref>  Curtis has described this mosaic as a "an advertisement... and a rare, unequivocal example of a motif inspired by a patron, rather than by the artist." <ref>Curtis, R.I., "A Personalized Floor Mosaic from Pompeii," ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' Vol. 88, No. 4, p. 557</ref> In Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use. Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as  "Lassius" and "L. Eumachius;" probably references to the name of the producer. Carbonised loaves of bread, found at Herculaneum, indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producer's name.<ref>Beard, M., ''The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found,'' Harvard University Press, 2008; See Chapter 5, "Earning a Living: Baker, Banker and Garum Maker,"</ref>

David Wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient Mesopotamia in the 4th century BCE, when large-scale economies started mass-producing commodities such as alcoholic drinks, cosmetics and textiles. These ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities, and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which over time were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus giving the product a personality.<ref>Wengrow, D., "Prehistories of Commodity Branding," ''Current Anthropology,''Vol. 49, No. 1, 2008, pp. 7-34</ref>

Diana Twede has argued that the "consumer packaging functions of protection, utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions" (p.&nbsp;107). She has shown that amphoras used in Mediterranean trade between 1500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which provided information for transactions. Systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality.<ref>Twede, D., "Commercial amphoras: The earliest consumer packages?" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 1, 2002, pp 98–108</ref>  Not all historians agree that these markings can be compared with modern brands or labels. Moore and Reid, for example, have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed ''proto-brands'' rather than modern brands.<ref>Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 Years of Branding," ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. p. 5; 23</ref>

===Marketing in the Middle Ages===

[[File:Aertsen, Pieter - Market Scene.jpg|thumb|left|Market scene by Pieter Aertsen, c.1550]]

In England and Europe during the Middle Ages, market towns sprang up. Some analysts have suggested that the term, 'marketing,' may have first been used in the context of market towns where the term 'marketing' may have been used by producers to describe the process of carting and selling their produce and wares in market towns. Blintiff has investigated the early Medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the 12th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional, different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns.<ref>Bintliff, J., "Going to Market in Antiquity," In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums,'' Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p.224</ref>

Braudel and Reynold have made a systematic study of these European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century.  Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week, while daily markets were more common in the larger cities and towns. Over time, permanent shops began to open daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets. Peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution by travelling door-to-door in order to sell produce and wares. The physical market was characterised by transactional exchange, bartering systems were commonplace and the economy was characterised by local trading. Braudel reports that, in 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances - grain 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and wollen cloth 20–40 miles. However, following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar - calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum  and coffee from the New World.<ref>Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century,'' Berkely, CA, University of California Press, 1992</ref>

Although the rise of consumer culture and marketing in Britain and Europe have been studied extensively, less is known about developments elsewhere.<ref>Southerton, D. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011 p. 888</ref>  Nevertheless, recent research suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early marketing practices; including branding, packaging, advertising and retail signage.<ref>Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding," ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. pp 419-32.</ref> From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 AD.<ref>Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. "A Brief History of Branding in China," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, pp 210-221</ref> Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty (960–1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite (p.&nbsp;212). The rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image, retail signage, symbolic brands, trademark protection and the brand concepts of baoji, hao, lei, gongpin, piazi and pinpai, which roughly equate with Western concepts of family status, quality grading, and upholding traditional Chinese values (p.&nbsp;219). Eckhardt and Bengtsson's analysis suggests that brands emerged in China as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture, in which brands provide social status and stratification. Thus, the evolution of brands in China stands in sharp contrast to the West where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate, increase market share and ultimately profits (pp 218–219).

===Marketing in seventeenth and eighteenth century Europe===
[[File:Philbrook - Wedgewood (2)crop.jpg|thumb|left|Josiah Wedgewood's 18th century techniques exhibited many of the characteristics of modern marketing]]
Scholars have identified specific instances of marketing practices in England and Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As trade between countries or regions grew, companies required information on which to base business decisions. Individuals and companies carried out formal and informal research on trade conditions. As early as 1380, Johann [[Fugger]] travelled from Augsburg to Graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry. He exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas.<ref>Nair, S. R., ''Market Research: Text and Cases,'' 2nd ed., Himalaya Publishing House, 2014, p. 21 <Online: www.himpub.com/documents/Chapter873.pdf></ref> In the early 1700s British industrial houses were demanding information, that could be used for business decisions. In the early 18th-century, [[Daniel Defoe]], a London merchant, published information on trade and economic resources of England and Scotland.<ref>Minto, W., ''Daniel Defoe,'' Tredition Classics, [Project Gutenberg ed.], Chapter 10</ref><ref>Richetti, J., ''The Life of Daniel Defoe: A Critical Biography,''  Malden, MAm Blackwell, 2005, 2015, pp 147-49 and 158-59</ref> Defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to trade including; ''Trade of Britain Stated,'' 1707; ''Trade of Scotland with France,'' 1713 and  ''The Trade to India Critically and Calmly Considered,'' 1720; all books that were highly popular with merchants and business houses of the period.<ref>Backscheider, P.R., 'Daniel Defoe: His Life,'' Baltimore, Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989</ref> While such activities might now be recognised as marketing research, at that time they were known as 'commercial research' or 'commercial intelligence' and not seen as part of the repertoire of activities that make up contemporary marketing practice.

Other scholars have found evidence of advertising and promotion in eighteenth century France and Italy as well as Britain. Far from being primitive efforts, early advertising showed a high level of sophistication in its execution and abilility to reach mass audiences.<ref name="dx.doi.org">Berg, M. and Clifford, H., "Selling Consumption in the Eighteenth Century Advertising and the Trade Card in Britain and France," ''The Journal of the Social History Society,'' Volume 4, No. 2, 2007, Stable URL: https://dx.doi.org/10.2752/147800307X199001</ref> In a major review of consumer society, McKendrick, Brewer and Plumb found extensive evidence of eighteenth century English entrepreneurs using 'modern' marketing techniques, including product differentiation, sales promotion and loss leader pricing.<ref name="McKendrick, N. 1982">McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb . J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England,'' London, 1982.</ref>

English industrialists, [[Josiah Wedgewood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]], are often portrayed as pioneers of modern mass marketing methods.<ref>Tadajewski, M. and Jones, D.G.B., "Historical research in marketing theory and practice: a review essay," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 30, No. 11-12, 2014 [Special Issue: Pushing the Boundaries, Sketching the Future], pp 1239-1291</ref> Wedgewood was known to have used marketing techniques such as direct mail, travelling salesmen and catalogues in the eighteenth century.<ref>Flanders, J., "They Broke It," ''New York Times,'' 9 January 2009, <Online:https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/opinion/10flanders.html?_r=2></ref> Josiah Wedgewood's marketing was highly sophisticated and recognisably 'modern' in that he planned production with the sale in mind.<ref>Sassatelli, R., ''Consumer Culture: History, Theory and Politics,'' Sage, 2007, p. 16;</ref> He carried out serious investigations into the fixed and variable costs of production and recognised that increased production would lead to lower unit costs. He also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving [[Economies of scale|scale economies]] in production. By cutting costs and lowering prices, Wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits.<ref>Drake, D., "Dinnerware & Cost Accounting? The Story of Josiah Wedgwood: Potter and Cost Accountant," ''HQ FINANCIAL VIEWS,'' Volume I, 1 May–July, 2005, pp 1-3</ref> Similarly, one of Wedgewood's contemporaries, [[Matthew Boulton]], pioneered early mass production techniques and product differentiation at his Soho Manufactory in the 1760s. He also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of 'celebrity marketing' - that is supplying the nobility, often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage, for the sake of the publicity and cudos generated.<ref>Applbaum, K., ''The Marketing Era: From Professional Practice to Global Provisioning,'' Routledge, 2004, p. 126-127</ref>

Fullerton argues that the practice of market segmentation emerged well before marketers used the notion formally.<ref>Fullerton, R., "Segmentation in Practice: An Overview of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries," in Jones,D.G.B. and Tadajewski,M. (eds), ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' Routledge, 2016, p. 94</ref> Certain strands of evidence suggest that simple examples of market segmentation were evident prior to the 1880s. The business historian, [[Richard S. Tedlow]], argues that any attempt to segment markets prior to 1880 was highly fragmented since the economy was characterised by small, regional suppliers who mostly sold goods on a local or regional basis.<ref>In his oft-cited work, ''New and Improved: The Story of Mass Marketing in America'', Basic Books, N.Y. 1990 pp. 4–12, Richard Tedlow outlines first three stages: fragmentation (prior to 1880), unification and the segmentation (1880-1920); segmentation era (1920s–1980s). In a subsequent work, published three years later, Tedlow and his co-author thought that they had seen evidence of a new trend and added a fourth era, termed Hyper-segmentation (post 1980s); See Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993 Ch 2</ref> When retail shops began to appear from the 15th century, retailers needed to separate the "riff raff" from wealthier customers. Outside the major metropolitan cities, few stores could afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively. However, gradually retail shops introduced innovations that would allow them to separate wealthier customers from the lower classes and peasants. One technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served.  This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack.<ref>Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England,'' Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp. 155–59</ref> The eighteenth century English entrepreneurs, [[Josiah Wedgewood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]], both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.<ref name="McKendrick, N. 1982"/> Evidence of early marketing segmentation has also been noted across Europe. A study of the German book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the 1820s.<ref>Fullerton, R.A., "Segmentation Strategies and Practices in the 19th-Century German Book Trade: A Case Study in the Development of a Major Marketing Technique", in ''Historical Perspectives in Consumer Research: National and International Perspectives,'' Jagdish N.

===Marketing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries ===
[[File:BourbonStModelT20Nov06Side.jpg|thumb|Henry Ford began manufacturing the mass-produced Model T in 1908. Ford famously said that customers could own a car in any colour as long as it was black.]]

Until the nineteenth century, Western economies were characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis. However, as transportation systems improved from the mid nineteenth century, the economy became more unified allowing companies to distribute standardised, branded goods a national level. This gave rise to a much broader mass marketing mindset. Manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve [[Economies of scale|scale economies]] with a view to keeping production costs down and also to achieving [[market penetration]] in the early stages of a product's life cycle.<ref>Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993 Ch 2</ref> The [[Ford Model T|Model T Ford]] was an example of a product being manufactured at a price that was affordable for the burgeoning middle classes.

In the early twentieth century, as market size increased, it became more commonplace for manufacturers to produce a variety of models pitched at different quality points designed to meet the needs of various demographic and lifestyle market segments, giving rise to the widespread practice of market segmentation and product differentation.<ref>Tedlow, R., ''New and Improved: The Story of Mass Marketing in America'', Basic Books, N.Y. 1990 pp 4-12</ref> Between 1902 -1910 George B Waldron, working at Mahin's advertising agency, used tax registers, city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated versus illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in what is believed to be the first example of demographic segmentation of a population.<ref>Jones, D.G.B. and Tadajewski, M. (eds), ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 66; Lockley, L.C., "Notes on the History of Marketing Research", ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 14, No. 5 (Apr., 1950), pp. 733-736 https://www.jstor.org/stable/1246952?seq=1#fndtn-page_scan_tab_contents</ref> Within little more than a decade, Paul Cherington had developed the 'ABCD' household typology - the first socio-demographic segmentation tool.<ref>Jones, D.G.B. and Tadajewski, M. (eds), ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 71)</ref> By the 1930s, market researchers such as [[Ernest Dichter]] were carrying out qualitative research into brand purchasers realised that demographic factors alone were insufficient to explain different marketing behaviour of various user groups. This insight led to the exploration of other factors such as lifestyles, values, attitudes and beliefs in market segmentation and advertising.<ref>Wilson B. S.  and Levy, J., "A History of the Concept of Branding: Practice and Theory", ''Journal of Historical Research in Marketing,'' vol. 4, no. 3, 2012, pp. 347-368; DOI: 10.1108/17557501211252934</ref>

When Wendell R. Smith published his now classic article, ''Product Differentiation and Market Segmentation as Alternative Marketing Strategies'' in 1956, he noted that he was simply documenting marketing practices that had been observed for some time and which he described as a "natural force".<ref>Smith, W.R., "Product Differentiation and Market Segmentation as Alternative Marketing Strategies," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 21, No. 1 , 1956, pp. 3–8 and reprinted in ''Marketing Management,'' Vol. 4, No. 3, 1995, pp. 63–65</ref>  Other theorists agree that Smith was simply codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in marketing and brand management from the early twentieth century.<ref>Cano, C., "The Recent Evolution of Market Segmentation Concepts and Thoughts Primarily by Marketing Academics," in E.

[[File:Haven-MasonHall.jpg|thumb|left|Haven-Mason Hall at the University of Michigan, where the first academic course in marketing was taught]]
As industry grew, the demand for skilled business professionals also grew. To meet this demand, universities began offering courses in commerce, economics and marketing. Marketing, as a discipline, was first taught in universities in the very early twentieth century.<ref>Maynard, H. H., "Marketing Courses Prior to 1910," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 5, no. 4, pp 382-384</ref> However, researchers only became interested in investigating the history of marketing in the mid twentieth century. From the outset, researchers tended to identify two strands of historical research; the history of marketing practice <ref>Keith, R. J., "The Marketing Revolution," ''Journal of Marketing,''  Vol. 24, No. 1; Jul 1959-Apr 1960, pp 35-38</ref> and the history of marketing thought which was fundamentally concerned with the rise of marketing education and dissecting the way that marketing was taught and studied.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>Maynard, H. H., "Early Teachers of Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,''  Vol. 7, No. 2, pp 158-159; Maynard, H. H., Weidler, W. C. & Beckman, T. N., ''Principles of Marketing, New York,  The Ronald Press, 1927</ref> Early historical studies were primarily descriptive.

==History of marketing practice==

The practice of marketing may have been carried out for millennia, but the modern concept of marketing as a professional practice appears to have emerged the post industrial corporate world.<ref>Southerton, D. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011 p. 890</ref> In addition to the studies of specific cultures or time periods, discussed in the preceding section, some historians of marketing have sought to write more general histories of marketing's evolution in the modern era. A key question that has preoccupied researchers is whether it is possible to identify specific orientations or mindsets that inform key periods in marketing's evolution. Marketers disagree about the way that marketing practice has evolved over time.<ref>Stowe, N. J., "Periodization of the History of Marketing Thought," In ''Proceedings of the First North America Workshop on Historical Research in Marketing,'' Stanley C. Hollander and Ronald Savitt (eds), East Lansing, Michigan State University Press, 1983, pp 1-12.</ref>

===Orientations and philosophies===

In the marketing literature, continuing debate surrounds the orientations or philosophies that might have informed marketing practice at different periods of time. An orientation may be defined as "the type of activity or subject that an organisation seems most interested in and gives most attention to".<ref>[http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/orientation "Orientation"], ''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English.</ref> In relation to marketing orientations, the term has been defined as a "philosophy of business management".<ref>Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11</ref> or "a corporate state of mind"<ref>Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., "Market  Orientation:  The Construct,  Research  Propositions, and  Managerial  Implications," ''Journal  of  Marketing,''  Vol.  54, April  1990, pp 1-18</ref> or as an "organisational culture".<ref>Narver, J.C. and Slater, S.F., "The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability, " ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol 54, no. 4, pp 20-34.</ref>

===Common periods===

The general lack of agreement amongst scholars as to what constitutes clearly identifiable periods and the orientation that characterised each distinct period has spawned a lengthy list of orientations. Space prevents an exhaustive description of all periods or eras. However, the salient features of the most commonly cited periods appear in the following section.

====Production orientation====

[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|The production orientation is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers]]

A production orientation is often proposed as the first of the so-called orientations that dominated business thought. Keith dated the production era from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is "one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers" and "is still useful in some situations".<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing, ''12th ed., Upper Saddle River, Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref>

The production orientation is characterised by:<ref>Kotler, P., "Marketing Management: Analysis, Planning, Implementation and Control", Prentice Hall, 1997 p.17</ref>

* Focus on production, manufacturing, and efficiency
* Attainment of economies of scale, economies of scope, experience effects or all three
* Assumption that demand exceeds supply
* Mindset that is encapsulated by [[Say's Law]]; "Supply creates its own demand" or "if somebody makes a product, somebody else will want to buy it"
* Limited research that is largely limited to technical-product research rather than customer research 
* Rose to prominence in an environment which had a shortage of manufactured goods relative to demand, so goods sold easily.
* Minimal [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] and [[advertising]], marketing communications limited to raising awareness of the product's existence

====Selling orientation====

[[File:The Rawleigh Man.JPG|thumb|The sales orientation, often characterised by door-to-door selling is thought to have begun during the Great Depression of the 1890s and continues to this day. Pictured: A Rawleigh's salesman in 1915]]
The selling orientation is thought to have begun during the [[Great Depression]] and continued well into the 1950s although examples of this orientation can still be found today.<ref>Solomon, N.R., Marshall, G. and Stuart, E., ''Marketing: Real People, Real Choices,'' 5th ed, Pearson, 2009, Chapter 1</ref> Kotler et al. note that the selling concept "is typically practised with unsought goods".<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing, ''12th ed., Upper Saddle River, Pearson Education, 2008, p. 29</ref>

The selling orientation is characterised by:
* Aggressive selling to push products, often involving door-to-door selling
* Accepting every possible sale or booking, regardless of its suitability for the business
* Strong transactional focus (ignores potential relationships)

====Marketing orientation====

The marketing orientation or the marketing concept emerged in the 1950s.

Characteristics of the marketing orientation:<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., "The Marketing Concept in Perspective," ''Business Horizons, May–June, 1988, pp 40-45</ref>

* Thorough understanding of the customer's needs, wants and behaviors should be the focal point of all marketing decisions
* Marketing efforts (sales, advertising, [[product management]], pricing)  should be integrated and in tune with the customer
* New product concepts should flow from extensive market analysis and product testing

====Societal marketing concept====
{{Main| Societal marketing}}

Phillip Kotler is often credited with first proposing the societal marketing orientation or concept in an article published in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' in 1972.<ref>Blackwell Reference, http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631233176_chunk_g978140510254422_ss1-48</ref><ref>Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers", ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp 48-57</ref>  However, some marketing historians, notably Wilkie and Moore, have argued that a societal perspective was evident in marketing theory and in marketing texts, since the discipline's inception in the early 1900s<ref>Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., "Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought", ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp 224-232 DOI: 10.1177/0276146706291067; Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development", ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp 116–146</ref> or that societal marketing is merely an extension of the marketing concept.<ref>Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal Marketing and Morality", ''European Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, pp 548-569, https://doi.org/10.1108/03090560210423014</ref>

The societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Instead, marketing activities should strive to benefit society's overall well-being. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including: employees, customers, local communities, the wider public and government and consider the impact of their activities on all stakeholders. They ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society. Societal marketing developed into [[sustainable marketing]].

Characteristics of societal marketing:<ref>Kotler, P and Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing,'' 9th ed., Prentice Hall; Griffin and Ebrert, ''Business'' 5th edition, Prentice Hall</ref>

* An attempt to balance corporate commitments to groups and individuals in its environment, including customers, other businesses, employees and investors.
* Companies must include social and ethical considerations into their marketing practices
* Consideration is given to the environment includes problems such as air, water, and land pollution
* Consideration is given to consumer rights, unfair pricing and ethics in advertising

====Relationship orientation====
{{Main| Relationship marketing}}

Starting in the 1990s, a new stage of marketing emerged called relationship marketing. The focus of relationship marketing is on a long-term relationship that benefits both the company and the customer.<ref name="dstevenwhite">{{cite web|last=White|first=D. Steven|title=The Evolution of Marketing| url=http://dstevenwhite.com/2010/06/18/the-evolution-of-marketing |accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> The relationship is based on trust and commitment, and both companies tend to shift their operating activities to be able to work more efficiently together.<ref name="Spiro2008">{{cite book|title=Management of a Sales Force|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|isbn=978-0-07-352977-6|author=Spiro, Roseann|edition=12th|author2=Gregory Rich |author3=William Stanton }}</ref> One of the most prominent reasons for relationship marketing comes from Kotler's idea that it costs about five times more to obtain a new customer than to maintain the relationship with an existing customer.<ref>{{cite web|last=McClintic Marion|first=Allison|title=Marketing: Historical Perspectives|url=http://www.enotes.com/business-finance-encyclopedia/marketing-historical-perspectives|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> A relationship marketing approach seeks to maximise the value of all the potential exchanges an organisation could have into the future.<ref>Volpato, G. and Stocchetti, A., [https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/30841 "Old and New Approaches to Marketing: The Quest of Their Epistemological Roots"], MPRA Paper No. 30841, 2009, p. 35</ref>

The characteristics of relationship marketing include:<ref>Christopher,  M.,  Payne,  A.  and  Ballantyne,  D., ''Relationship  Marketing: Bringing Quality, Customer Service, and Marketing Together,'' Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann, 1991, p. 9</ref>

* Focus on the relationship between seller and buyer
* Investment in the lifetime of relationships rather than single transactions by calculating [[customer lifetime value]] (CLV)
* Orientation on product benefits and/or customer value
* Better customer service, commitment, and contact
* Quality is the concern of all
* All activities are coordinated with the customer interface, including the customer's involvement in the firm's processes 
* Customised offerings where practical

Empirical support for relationship marketing as a distinct paradigm is very weak. One study suggests that relationship marketing is really a  sub-component of large scale movements of the value-added process rather than a separate era or framework.<ref>Manna, D.R. and Smith, A.D., "Measuring The Theoretical Paradigm Shift From Marketing Mix To Relational Marketing", ''International Business & Economics Research Journal,'' Vol. 2, No. 11, 2000, pp 1-8</ref> Some theorists suggest that marketing is moving from a relationship marketing paradigm and towards a social media paradigm where marketers have access to a more controlled environment and are able to customise offers and communications messages.<ref name="dstevenwhite" /><ref>Peppers & Rogers Group, ''Relationship Marketing 3.0: Thriving in Marketing's New Ecosystem,'' [White Paper], 2009</ref>

===Periodisations===

To investigate the history of marketing practice, scholars often turn to a method known as periodisation.<ref name="Hollander, S.C. 2005, pp 32-41">Hollander, S.C., Rassuli, K.M. Jones, G.D.B., and Dix, L.F.,  "Periodization in Marketing History," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 25 No. 1, June 2005, pp 32-41, DOI: 10.1177/0276146705274982</ref> [[Periodization|Periodisation]] refers to the  process or study of categorizing the past into discrete, quantified, named units for the purpose of analysis or study.<ref>Collins Dictionary Online, https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/periodization</ref> Scholars do not agree on the periods that characterise the history of marketing practice. In a major review of the periodisation approach, Hollander et al. have identified fourteen different "stage theories" or "short periodisations" as well as a total of nineteen "long periodisations" that have been carried out since 1957. Of these, the contributions of Robert Keith (1960) and Ronald Fullerton (1988) are the most frequently cited.<ref>Hollander, S.C., Jones, D.G.B. and Dix, L., "Periodization in Marketing History," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 25, no. 1, pp 33-39</ref>

====Keith's periodisation====

[[File:"Pillsbury's "A" Mill, the Largest Flour Mill in the World, Minneapolis, Minnesota" - postcard.jpg|thumb|Robert Keith's marketing eras (production →selling →marketing) were based entirely on his experience at the Pillsbury Company]]

In 1960, Robert Keith, the then Vice President of [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]],<ref>Holloway, R.J., "Leaders in Marketing: Robert Keith," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 32, July 1968, pp 74-75</ref> set the stage for decades of controversy when he published an article entitled the "Marketing Revolution" in which he set out the way that the Pillsbury Company had shifted from a focus on production in the 1860s through to a consumer focus in the 1950s. He traced three distinct eras in Pillsbury's evolution:<ref>Keith, R.  J., "The Marketing Revolution," ''Journal of Marketing,''  Vol. 24, No. 1; Jul 1959-Apr 1960, pp 35-38</ref>

* Production-oriented era (1869–1930s): characterised by a "focus on production processes"
* Sales-oriented era (1930s–1950s): characterised by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits
* Marketing-oriented era (1950s–present): characterised by a focus on the customer's latent and existing needs

In addition, Keith hypothesised that a "marketing control era" was about to emerge. Although Keith's article explicitly documented Pillsbury's evolution, the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at Pillsbury constitute a standard or normal evolutionary path (production→sales→marketing) for most large organisations.

Keith's notion of distinct eras in the evolution of marketing practice has been widely criticised and his periodisation described as "hopelessly flawed".<ref>Brown, S., "Trinitarianism: The Eternal Angel and the Three Eras Schema", in Brown, S., Bell, J. and Carson, D., ''Marketing Apocalypse: Eschatology, Escapology and the Illusion of the End,'' London, Routledge, 1996,  pp 25-26</ref><ref>Gilbert, D. and Bailey, N., "The Development of Marketing: A Compendium of Historical Approaches," ''Quarterly Review of Marketing,'' vol. 15, no. 2, 1990, pp 6-13 and reproduced in ''Marketing: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management,'' Vol. 2, Michael John Baker (ed), London, Routledge, 2001, pp 75-91</ref> Specific criticisms of Keith's tripartite periodisation include that:

* It ignores historical facts about business conditions<ref name="Gilbert, D 1990, pp 6-13">Gilbert, D. and Bailey, N., "The Development of Marketing: A Compendium of Historical Approaches", (originally published in ''Quarterly Review of Marketing,'' vol. 15, no. 2, 1990, pp 6-13) and reproduced in ''Marketing: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management,'' Vol. 2, Michael John Baker (ed), London, Routledge, 2001, p. 81</ref>
* It misstates the nature of [[supply and demand]]<ref name="Gilbert, D 1990, pp 6-13"/>
* It slights the growth of marketing institutions<ref>Gilbert, D. and Bailey, N., "The Development of Marketing: A Compendium of Historical Approaches," ''Quarterly Review of Marketing,'' vol. 15, no. 2, 1990, pp 6-13 and reproduced in ''Marketing: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management,'' Vol. 2, Michael John Baker (ed), London, Routledge, 2001, p. 82</ref>

The article, which is entirely based on Keith's personal recollections and did not use a single reference, is best described as ''anecdotal.'' Systematic studies carried out since Keith's work have failed to replicate Keith's periodisation. Instead, other studies suggest that many companies exhibited a marketing orientation in the 19th-century and that the business schools were teaching marketing decades before Pillsbury adopted a marketing-oriented approach.<ref name="Brown, S. 1996, p. 26">Brown, S., "Trinitarianism: The Eternal Angel and the Three Eras Schema," in Brown, S., Bell, J. and Carson, D., ''Marketing Apocalypse: Eschatology, Escapology and the Illusion of the End,'' London, Routledge, 1996, p. 26</ref> Jones and Richardson also investigated historical accounts of marketing practice and found evidence for both the sales and marketing era during the so-called production era and concluded that there was no "marketing revolution".<ref>Jones, D.G.B. and Richardson, A.J., "The Myth of the Marketing Revolution" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' March 1, 2007</ref> A detailed study of the chocolate manufacturer, Rowntree, found that this company had shifted from a production orientation through to a marketing orientation by the 1930s, without having transitioned through the so-called sales orientation.<ref>Fitzgerald, R., "Rowntree and Market Strategy: 1897-1939," ''Business and Economic History,'' Vol. 18, 1989, pp 45- 58,</ref> Other critiques of Keith's work have pointed out that the so-called "production era" fails to align with historical facts and have suggested that it is a myth.<ref name="Fullerton, E.A. 1988, pp. 108-125">Fullerton, E.A., "How Modern Is Modern Marketing? Marketing's Evolution and the Myth of the 'Production Era' ", ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 52, No. 1, 1988, pp. 108-125</ref> Keith's eras have become known, somewhat cynically, as the ''standard chronology''.<ref>Jones, D.G.B. and Shaw, E.H., “A History of Marketing Thought”, in Weitz, B.A. and Wensley, R. (Eds), ''Handbook of Marketing'', Sage, London, 2002, pp. 39-66; Shaw, E.H., “Reflections on the History of Marketing Thought”, ''Journal of Historical Research in Marketing'', Vol. 1 No. 2, 2009, pp. 330-345.</ref>

====Fullerton's periodisation====

[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|The English industrial revolution is often seen as a trigger for the rise of modern marketing]]

In 1988, Fullerton developed a more subtle and nuanced periodisation for the so-called marketing eras.<ref>Brown, S., "Trinitarianism: The Eternal Angel and the Three Eras Schema", in Brown, S., Bell, J. and Carson, D., ''Marketing Apocalypse: Eschatology, Escapology and the Illusion of the End,'' London, Routledge, 1996, p. 26,  https://www.jstor.org/stable/1251689</ref><ref>Gilbert, D. and Bailey, N., "The Development of Marketing: A Compendium of Historical Approaches," ''Quarterly Review of Marketing,'' vol. 15, no. 2, 1990, pp 6-13 and reproduced in ''Marketing: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management,'' Vol. 2, Michael John Baker (ed), London, Routledge, 2001, pp 84-86</ref> Fullerton's eras were:<ref name="Fullerton, E.A. 1988, pp. 108-125"/>

* Era of antecedents (1500–1750): a long gestational period in which people were largely self-sufficient and rural; economy characterised by low levels of consumption; commerce was seen as suspicious 
* Era of origins (1750–1870): precipitated by the dislocations of the English industrial revolution and the rise of a more urban population, this era is characterised by more attention to persuasive tactics designed to stimulate demand
* Era of institutional development (1850–1929): many of the large institutions and modern marketing practices emerged during this period
* Era of refinement and formalization (1930–present): further development and refinement of principles and practices developed in the preceding period

In spite of the intense criticism leveled at Keith's eras of marketing practice, his periodisation is the most frequently cited in textbooks<ref name="Hollander, S.C. 2005, pp 32-41"/> and has become the accepted wisdom.<ref name="Hollander, S.C. 2005, p. 39"/> One content analysis of 25 introductory and advanced texts found that Keith's eras were reproduced in all but four.<ref>Hollander, 1986</ref><ref name="Brown, S. 1996, p. 26"/>  Another study, which examined 15 of the top selling marketing texts, found that the although the incidence of repeating Keith's eras was waning, it had not been replaced by Fullerton's periodisation, nor any other more meaningful framework.<ref>Brown, S., "Trinitarianism: The Eternal Angel and the Three Eras Schema," in Brown, S., Bell, J. and Carson, D., ''Marketing Apocalypse: Eschatology, Escapology and the Illusion of the End,'' London, Routledge, 1996, p. 27</ref>

====Other periodisations====

For all the controversies surrounding marketing stages or periods, Keith and others appear to have contributed a lasting legacy.<ref>Olsen, B. and Costas, H., "The Periodization of Marketing: Myth or Reality? Evidence from the Scott Paper Company, " ''Academy of Marketing Studies Journal,'' Vol. 15, No. S2, 2011</ref> A study by Grundey (2010) suggests that many contemporary textbooks begin with Keith's eras and expand on it by including newer concepts such as the ''societal marketing concept'', the ''relationship marketing concept'' and  the ''interfunctional concept'', as shown in the table below.<ref name = grund/> More recently, Kotler and Keller added the ''holistic marketing concept'' to the list of eras in marketing.<ref>Kotler and Keller advanced the notion of a ''holistic era'' in Kevin Lane Keller and Philip Kotler, “Holistic Marketing: A Broad, Integrated Perspective to Marketing Management,” in ''Does Marketing Need Reform?,'' Jagdish Sheth and Raj Sisodia (eds), 2006, pp 300-305; did not include it in their 2008 publication but added it back in their most recent work; Kotler, P and Keller, K.L., ''A Framework for Marketing Management,'' 6th Global ed., Harlow, Essex, Pearson, 2016, pp 34-35</ref> Marketing theorists continue to debate whether the holistic era represents a genuine new orientation or whether it is an extension of the marketing concept. Grundey summarised five different periodisations in the history of marketing, as shown in the following table, as a means of highlighting the general lack of agreement among scholars.<ref name = grund>Grundey, D., "The Marketing Philosophy and Challenges for the New Millennium", ''Scientific Bulletin – Economic Sciences: Marketing, Commerce and Tourism,'' Vol. 9, no. 15, 2010, p 170</ref>

==History of marketing thought==
[[File:University of Pennsylvania- its history, traditions, buildings and memorials- also a brief guide to Philadelphia (1918) (14578085070).jpg|thumb|left|University of Pennsylvania was among the first universities to offer courses in marketing]]
Dating the history of marketing, as an academic discipline, is just as problematic as the history of marketing practice. Marketing historians cannot agree on how to date the beginnings of marketing thought.<ref>Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 46-48</ref> Eric Shaw, for instance, suggests that a period of pre-academic marketing thought can be identified prior to 1900.<ref>Shaw, E.H., (2015) "Teaching the History of Marketing Thought: An Approach", ''Journal of Historical Research in Marketing,'' Vol. 7, No. 2</ref>  Other historians suggest that the theory of marketing only emerged in the 20th century when the discipline began to offer courses at universities.<ref>Bartels, R.,"The Identity Crisis in Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 38, No. 4, pp 73-76; Bartels, R., ''The History of Marketing Thought,'' Columbus, Ohio: Grid.</ref>  Nevertheless, the birth of marketing as a discipline is usually designated to the first decade of the twentieth century when "marketing courses" appeared in universities. In 1902, the University of Michigan offered what many believe to be the very first course in marketing.<ref>Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 52</ref> The University of Illinois also started offering coursework in marketing in 1902.<ref>Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 47.</ref> In the academic year, 1904-1905, the University of Pennsylvania commenced teaching marketing. Other universities soon followed, including the Harvard Business School.<ref>Volpato, G. and Stocchetti, A., "Old and new approaches to marketing: The quest of their epistemological roots," MPRA Paper No. 30841, 2009, <Online: https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/30841></ref>

Prior to the emergence of marketing courses, marketing was not recognised as a discipline in its own right; rather it was treated as a branch of economics and was often called ''applied economics.'' Subjects, which today might be recognised as marketing-related, were embedded in economics courses. Early marketing theories were described as modifications or adaptations of economic theories.<ref>Ferrell, O.C., Hair J.C. Jr., Marshall, G.W. and Tamilia, R.D., "Understanding the History of Marketing Education to Improve Classroom Instruction," ''Marketing Education Review,'' Vol. 25, no. 2, p. 161, DOI:10.1080/10528008.2015.1038963</ref>

The impetus for the separation of marketing and economics was due, at least in part, to economic's focus on production as the creator of economic value and general failure to investigate distribution. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, as markets became more globalised, distribution began to assume increasing importance. Some economics professors began to run courses examining various aspects of the marketing system, including "distributive and regulative systems." Other courses, such as the "marketing of products" and the "marketing of farm-products" followed. As the first decades of the 20th century progressed, books and articles concerning marketing topics began to emerge.<ref>Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp 116–146</ref> In 1936, the publication of the new ''Journal of Marketing'' gave marketing academics a forum for exchanging ideas and research methods and also gave the discipline a real sense of its own distinct identity as a maturing academic discipline.<ref>Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp 119–121</ref>

===A periodisation approach===

Several scholars have attempted to describe the evolution of marketing thought chronologically and to connect it with broader intellectual and academic trends. Bartels (1965) provided a brief account of marketing's formative periods, and Shah and Gardner (1982) briefly considered the development of the six dominant schools in contemporary marketing.<ref>Cited in: Lavin, M. and Archdeacon.

http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/12176/volumes/sv07/SV-07></ref> However, these initial attempts have been criticised as overly descriptive.<ref>Savitt, R., "Historical Research in Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' 44, 1980, pp. 52-158.</ref> One of the first theorists to consider the stages in the development of marketing thought was Robert Bartels, who in ''The History of Marketing Thought,'' (1965) used a periodisation approach. He categorised the development of marketing theory decade by decade from the beginning of the 20th century:

* 1900s: discovery of basic concepts and their exploration
* 1910s: conceptualisation, classification and definition of terms
* 1920s: integration on the basis of principles
* 1930s: development of specialisation and variation in theory
* 1940s: reappraisal in the light of new demands and a more scientific approach
* 1950s: reconceptualisation in the light of [[managerialism]], social development and quantitative approaches
* 1960s: differentiation on bases such as managerialism, [[holism]], [[environmentalism]], [[systems theory|system]]s, and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]
* 1970s: socialisation; the adaptation of marketing to social change

Bartels was the first historian to provide a "long view of marketing’s past and wide sweep of its subdisciplines" and in so doing, he nurtured an interest in the history of marketing thought.<ref>Shaw, E.H. and Tamilia, E.D., "Robert Bartels and the History of Marketing Thought," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol 21, Issue 2, 2001</ref>

===A 'schools of thought' approach===

Other marketing historians have eschewed the periodisation approach, and instead considered whether distinct schools within marketing reflect different facets of common theory and whether a more unifying intellectual structure has emerged. These approaches tend to identify distinct schools of thought. A [[school of thought]] refers to an intellectual tradition or a group of scholars who share a common philosophy or set of ideas.<ref>Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/school-of-thought.html</ref> Marketing historians, Shaw and Jones, define a school of thought as one that has "a substantial body of knowledge; developed by a number of scholars; and  describing at least one aspect of the what, how, who, why, when and where of performing marketing activities." <ref name="Shaw, E 2005, p. 241">Shaw, E. H and Jones, D.G.B., "A history of schools of marketing thought," ''Marketing Theory,'' Vol 5, No 3, 2005, p. 241</ref>

To a certain extent, there is some agreement that in early marketing thought, three so-called traditional schools, namely the commodity school, the functional school and the institutional school co-existed.<ref>Shaw, E. H and Jones, D.G.B., "A history of schools of marketing thought," ''Marketing Theory,'' Vol 5, No 3, 2005, pp 230-</ref> Marketing historians such as Eric Shaw and Barton A. Weitz point to the publication of [[Wroe Alderson]]'s book, ''Marketing Behavior and Executive Action'' (1957), as a break-point in the history of marketing thought,<ref name=Bartels88>
{{cite book|last=Bartels|first=Robert|title=The History of Marketing Thought |publisher=Publishing Horizons|location=Columbus|year=1988|edition=3rd.}}</ref> moving from the macro functions-institutions-commodities approach to a [[micromarketing]] [[management]] [[paradigm]]. Following on from Alderson, marketing began to incorporate other fields of knowledge besides economics, notably [[behavioral science]] and psychology, becoming a multi-disciplinary field. For many scholars, Alderson's book marks the beginning of the ''Marketing Management Era.'' Of those historians who identify schools, there is no real agreement about which schools were dominant at different stages in marketing's development. Although the distinctive features of these schools can be identified and described, many of the early text-books included elements drawn from two or more schools of thought- for example, in a series of chapters devoted to commodities followed by a series of chapters devoted to the institutional and functional schools.<ref>Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, p. 121</ref>

In the following section, a brief overview of the contributions of key thinkers will be outlined with respect to the prevailing schools that have dominated marketing thought.

[[Shelby D. Hunt|Hunt]] and Goolsby, identified four schools of thought that have dominated marketing, namely; the commodity school, the institutional school, the functional school and the managerial school.<ref>Hunt, Shelby D. and Goolsby, Jerry, "The Rise and Fall of the Functional Approach to Marketing: A Paradigm Displacement Perspective," in Historical Perspectives in Marketing: Essays in Honour of Stanley Hollander, Terence Nevett and Ronald Fullerton (eds), Lexington, MA, Lexington Books, pp 35-37, sdh.ba.ttu.edu/Rise%20and%20Fall%20(88).pdf</ref>

* ''The Commodity School'': A focus on different types of goods in the marketplace and how they are marketed.<ref>Ferrell, O.C., Ferrell,L. and Sawayda, J.,"A Historical Review and Reconceptualization of Commodity Marketing," in ''Commodity Marketing,''  Enke, Margit, Geigenmüller, Anja, Leischnig, Alexander (Eds), Springer, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-658-02925-8_22, pp 431-447</ref>
* ''The Institutional School'': Emphasised the functions of middlemen (or intermediaries); similar to the functional school, but with a focus on channel flows.<ref>Shaw, E. H and Jones, D.G.B., "A history of schools of marketing thought," ''Marketing Theory,'' Vol 5, No 3, 2005, p. 245 and 252</ref>
* ''The Functional School'': A focus on the characteristics of marketing, identifying the functions and systems of marketing; adopts a systems approach.<ref name="Shaw, E 2005, p. 241"/>
* ''The Managerial School'': A focus on the problems faced by marketing managers; focuses on the perspective of the seller.<ref>Shaw, E. H and Jones, D.G.B., "A history of schools of marketing thought," ''Marketing Theory,'' Vol 5, No 3, 2005, pp 257-58</ref>

Some marketing historians like [[Jagdish Sheth]] have identified the modern "marketing schools" as:<ref>Sheth, J. N. and Gardner, D.M., ''Marketing Theory: Evolution and Evaluation,'' New York, Wiley, 1988</ref>

* ''The Managerial school'' emerged during the late 1950s and became arguably the predominant and most influential school of thought in the field
* ''The Consumer/buyer behavior school'', which dominated the academic field in the second half of the twentieth century (apart from the Managerial school), features theories emerging from behavioral science
* ''The Social exchange school'', which focuses on exchange as the fundamental concept of marketing

Yet other commentators identify a broader range of schools. O'Malley and Lichrou, for example, document the schools as:<ref>O'Malley, L. and Lichrou, M., "Marketing Theory," in Baker, M.J. and Hart, S., ''The Marketing Book,'' 7th ed., Routledge, Oxon, UK, 2016, pp 37-52</ref>
	
* ''Functional'':  What activities does marketing perform?  Focus on intermediaries and value adding. 
* ''Commodities'':  How are goods classified? Focus on classification of goods; trade flows
* ''Marketing Institutions'': Who performs marketing functions on commodities?  Focus on retailers, wholesalers, intermediaries, distribution channels
* ''Marketing Management'': How should marketers and managers market products and services to consumers? Business firm as seller/ supplier
* ''Marketing Systems'': What is a marketing system and how does it work?  Channels of distribution and aggregate systems, 
* ''Consumer behaviour'': How and why do consumers buy? organisational buyer and consumer buyer
* ''Macro-marketing'': How do marketing systems impact on society?  Industries, channels, consumer movement, environmentalism 
* ''Exchange'': What are the forms of exchange? Who are the parties to the exchange process? Aggregations of buyers and sellers
* ''Marketing history'': When did marketing practice and ideas emerge and evolve? Marketing thought and marketing practice

===Brief description of the dominant schools of thought===

By the 1920s, the marketing discipline was organised into three schools of thought: the commodity school, the institutional school and the functional school.The following sections briefly outlines the schools of thought as conceptualised by key thinkers in the discipline. Although these can be treated as separate schools of thought, considerable overlap between them is evident. The three schools that preceded marketing management exhibited a highly descriptive approach and collectively these are often called the ''classical schools.'' These schools borrowed heavily from economics and were largely concerned with aggregate demand and lacked a focus on the individual firm.<ref>Sheth, J.N., "History of Consumer Behavior: a Marketing Perspective", in ''Historical Perspectives in Consumer Research: National and International Perspectives,'' Jagdish N. Sheth and Chin Tiong Tan (eds), Singapore: Association for Consumer Research, 1985, pp 5-7 <Online: http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/12106/volumes/sv05/SV-05></ref> By the 1960s, all previous schools of thought had been eclipsed by the managerial school because it offered a problem-solving approach and presented marketers with potential solutions to marketing problems that were frequently encountered.<ref>Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H, "A History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, B. A. and Wensley, R. (eds), Sage, p. 54 and p. 56</ref>

====The commodity school====
[[File:Semillas de cacao.jpg|thumb|The commodity school focused on the ''objects of exchange.'' Pictured: Cocao beans]]

The commodity school is thought to have originated with an article by C.C. Parlin (1916) with a focus on the ''objects of exchange'' and was primarily concerned with classifying commodities. A different article published by Copeland, and published in the ''Harvard Business Review'' (1923) proposed the convenience-shopping-specialty goods classification which is still in use today. Other theorists developed a plethora of methods for classifying goods.<ref>Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H, "A History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, B. A. and Wensley, R. (eds), Sage, pp 53-54</ref>

==== The institutional school====

The institutional school focused its attention on the ''agents of market transactions,'' specifically those organisations active in the intermediary channel system, such as wholesalers and retailers. It was primarily concerned with documenting the channels of distribution, the functions performed by channel members and the value-adding services they provided. In short, the institutional school was fundamentally concerned with the activities required to achieve efficiency within distribution systems. The institutional school was heavily influenced by economics, but in the 1970s, began to take on ideas from behavioural science.<ref>Sheth, J. N., Gardner, D.M. and Garrett, D., ''Theories of Marketing,'' New York: Wiley, 1985</ref> A key work in the institutional school tradition is Weld's ''The Marketing of Farm Products,'' (1916) while other important contributors included: Butler's ''Marketing and Merchandising,'' (1923); Breyer's ''Commodity and Marketing'' (1931); Converse's ''Marketing: Methods and Policies'' (1921) and Duddy & Revzan's ''Marketing: An Institutional Approach'' (1947).<ref>Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H, "A History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, B. A. and Wensley, R. (eds), Sage, p. 54</ref>

====The functional school ====
The functional school was thought to have originated with the publication of Shaw's article, ''Some Problems in Market Distribution,'' (1912)  The functional school was primarily concerned with documenting the ''functions of marketing.'' In other words, it attempted to address the question, What work does marketing do? Different theorists within the functional school produced long lists of marketing's functions. Although there was little agreement about what should be included in the list, much of it revolved around the value added by marketing intermediaries. In those early years, advertising and promotion was rarely seen as a marketing function. In addition to Shaw, key thinkers in the functional school included Weld, Vanderblue and Ryan.<ref>Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H, "A History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, B. A. and Wensley, R. (eds), Sage. pp. 55-55, {{ISBN|1-4129-2120-1}}</ref>

====Marketing management====
[[File:Problem solving in program- solution underway from museum of mathematics (8616623554).jpg|thumb|The marketing management school focuses on typical problems encountered by marketers]]
[[Wroe Alderson]] changed marketing thought with the publication of his work, ''Marketing Behaviour and Executive Action'' (1957) in which he was primarily concerned with the problems and challenges faced by marketers and the types of solutions that had been found to be successful. This shifted the emphasis away from the functions of marketing and towards a more problem-solving approach, thereby paving the way for a more managerial approach within the discipline.<ref>Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H, "A History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, B. A. and Wensley, R. (eds), Sage. p. 58, {{ISBN|1-4129-2120-1}}</ref> Some historians have claimed that Alderson's article signalled a ''paradigm shift'' in thinking, towards a new ''macromarketing'' approach.<ref>Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, p. 123</ref>

The marketing management school emerged as the dominant school in the 1960s following the publication of ''Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach,'' written by [[E. Jerome McCarthy]] and replaced the so-called functional school which had been the dominant school for the first part of the twentieth century. In the words of Hunt and Goolsby, the publication of McCarthy's text, sounded the "beginning of the end for the functional school." <ref>Hunt, Shelby D. and Goolsby, Jerry, "The Rise and Fall of the Functional Approach to Marketing: A Paradigm Displacement Perspective," in ''Historical Perspectives in Marketing: Essays in Honour of Stanley Hollander,'' Terence Nevett and Ronald Fullerton (eds), Lexington, MA, Lexington Books, pp 35-51, sdh.ba.ttu.edu/Rise%20and%20Fall%20(88).pdf</ref>
However, Hunt and Goolsby note that the 1960s was a transitional period in which both the functional school and the managerial school co-existed.<ref>Hunt, Shelby D. and Goolsby, Jerry, "The Rise and Fall of the Functional Approach to Marketing: A Paradigm Displacement Perspective," in ''Historical Perspectives in Marketing: Essays in Honour of Stanley Hollander,'' Terence Nevett and Ronald Fullerton (eds), Lexington, MA, Lexington Books, pp 35-51, sdh.ba.ttu.edu/Rise%20and%20Fall%20(88).pdf, p. 41</ref>  Shaw and Jones have described the emergence of the managerial school in the mid-twentieth century as a "paradigm shift." <ref>Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, " A History of Marketing Thought,"  ''Marketing Theory,'' 2005; Vol. 5, No. 3, p. 239</ref>

While the management school continued to borrow from economics, it also introduced ideas from the new and emerging fields of sociology and psychology, which offered useful insights for explaining aspects of consumer behaviour such as the influence of culture and social class. Key works in the marketing management tradition include Wroe Alderson's ''Marketing Behavior and Executive Action,'' (1957), Howard's ''Marketing Management'' (1957), Lazer's ''Managerial Marketing: Perspectives and Viewpoints,'' (1957) and McCarthy's ''Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach'' (1960).<ref>Brian Jones, D.G. and Shaw, E.H, "The History of Marketing Thought," in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Weitz, R. and Wensley, R. (eds), London, UK, 2003,  p. 60</ref>

The salient features of the managerial approach to marketing are:

* "an overt marketing-as-management orientation, and 
* an overt reliance on the behavioral and quantitative sciences as means of knowing."  <ref>Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., "Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, p. 225</ref>
