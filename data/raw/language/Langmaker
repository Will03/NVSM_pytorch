==History==

Langmaker began as ''Model Languages'', a [[newsletter]] published by Henning between 1995 and 1996,<ref>[http://www.langmaker.com/backissu.htm Langmaker Back issues] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629200232/http://www.langmaker.com/backissu.htm |date=June 29, 2007 }}</ref> in which he attempted to better publicize the hobby of conlanging and to explore various issues and questions related to conlanging.  Shortly, Henning moved to a [[website]] format.  He began not only discussing and commenting on [[conlangs]] but also cataloguing them in a comprehensive database, with overviews of the languages and links to their respective websites.  Henning ultimately began adding [[neologisms]]; babel texts; [[neography|neographies]]; books on [[languages]], [[linguistics]], and conlanging; and other general resources to his database.  Langmaker has been viewed by many as an information and activity hub in the online conlanging world.

In April 2007, Langmaker was converted to [[wiki]] format, allowing its many readers to themselves make contributions to the website.  Henning has since left the maintenance of the site primarily to its casual contributors and administrators, who continued to contribute up until January 4, 2008, when the site was locked.<ref>[http://www.langmaker.com/db/Special:Recentchanges Langmaker Special:Recentchanges web page]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806090920/http://www.langmaker.com/db/Special%3ARecentchanges |date=August  6, 2007 }}</ref>

[[Mark Rosenfelder]] writes, "Jeffrey Henning writes and posts regularly on the process of creating model languages and reviews a number of projects."<ref>[http://www.zompist.com/kit.html The Language Construction Kit], Accessed October 30, 2007.</ref> As of November 11, 2015, the domain name has been bought.
