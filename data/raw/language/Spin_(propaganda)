[[File:Statement von GS Kyrle zur Befreiung der Jemen Geiseln (8724149668).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Public figures use [[press conference]]s so often as a way to control the timing and specificity of their messages to the media that press conference facilities have been nicknamed "[[spin room]]s".]]
In [[public relations]] and [[politic]]s, '''spin''' is a form of [[propaganda]], achieved through providing a biased interpretation of an event or campaigning to persuade [[public opinion]] in favor or against some organization or public figure. While traditional public relations and [[advertising]] may also rely on altering the presentation of the facts, "spin" often implies the use of [[Wikt:disingenuous|disingenuous]], [[deceptive]], and highly [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] tactics.<ref>[[William Safire]], "[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/magazine/the-spinner-spun.html The Spinner Spun]", ''New York Times'', December 22, 1996.</ref> 

Because of the frequent association between spin and [[press conference]]s (especially [[government]] press conferences), the room in which these conferences take place is sometimes described as a "[[spin room]]".<ref>Michael, Powell. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/us/politics/22scene.html "Tit for Tat on a Night Where Spin Is Master,"] ''New York Times.'' February 22, 2008.</ref> Public relations advisors, pollsters and media [[consultant]]s who develop deceptive or misleading messages may be referred to as "'''spin doctors'''" or "'''spinmeisters'''".

As such, a standard tactic used in "spinning" is to reframe, reposition, or otherwise modify the perception of an issue or event, to reduce any negative impact it might have on public opinion. For example, a company whose top-selling product is found to have a significant safety problem may "reframe" the issue by criticizing the safety of its main competitor's products or indeed by highlighting the risk associated with the entire product category. This might be done using a "catchy" [[slogan]] or [[sound bite]] that can help to persuade the public of the company's biased [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]. This tactic could enable the company to defocus the public's attention on the negative aspects of its product. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

As it takes experience and training to "spin" an issue, spinning is typically a service provided by paid media advisors and media [[consultant]]s. The largest and most powerful companies may have in-house employees and sophisticated units with expertise in spinning issues. While spin is often considered to be a private sector tactic, in the 1990s and 2000s, some politicians and political staff have been accused by their opponents of using deceptive "spin" tactics to manipulate public opinion or deceive the public. Spin approaches used by some political teams include "burying" potentially negative new information by releasing it at the end of the workday on the last day before a long weekend; selectively [[cherry-picking]] quotes from previous speeches made by their employer or an opposing politician to give the impression that they advocate a certain position; and purposely [[News leak|leaking]] [[misinformation]] about an opposing politician or candidate that casts them in a negative light.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

== History ==
[[Edward Bernays]] has been called the "Father of Public Relations". As [[Larry Tye]] describes in his book ''The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of [[Public Relations]]'', Bernays was able to help [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]] companies use techniques to make certain behaviors more socially acceptable in 20th-century United States. Tye claims that Bernays was proud of his work as a propagandist.<ref>Stauber, John and Sheldon Rampton. [http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1999Q2/bernays.html  "Book Review: ''The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays & The Birth of PR'' by Larry Tye,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121185416/http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1999Q2/bernays.html |date=2008-11-21 }} ''PR Watch'' (Second Quarter 1999). Vol. 6, No. 2.</ref> As information technology has increased dramatically since the end of the 20th century, commentators like [[Joe Trippi]] have advanced the theory that modern [[Internet activism]] spells the end for political spin. By providing immediate counterpoint to every point a "spin doctor" can come up with, this theory suggests, the omnipresence of the Internet in some societies will inevitably lead to a reduction in the effectiveness of spin.<ref>Branigan, Tania, "[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/13/newmedia.egovernment Internet spells end for political spin, says US web guru]", ''[[The Guardian]]''. 12 June 2007.</ref>

== Techniques ==
The techniques of spin include:
*[[File:Picking Cherries.jpg|alt=Cherry picking as a farming and a public relations practice.|thumb|Cherry picking is a practice of using selective facts to present to the public. It refers to the farming practice of picking only ripe cherries. ]]Selectively presenting facts and quotes that support one's position ("[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]"). For example, a pharmaceutical company could pick and choose two trials where their product shows a positive effect, ignoring hundreds of unsuccessful trials, or a politician's staff could handpick short speech quotations from past years which appear to show their candidate's support for a certain position.
* [[Non-denial denial]]
* [[Non-apology apology]]
* "[[Mistakes were made]]" is an example of [[distancing language]] commonly used as a rhetorical device, whereby a speaker acknowledges that a situation was managed by using low-quality or inappropriate handling but evades any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by not specifying the person or organization who made the mistakes. Grammatically, the expression uses the [[English passive voice|passive voice]] to focus on the action while omitting the actor. The acknowledgement of "mistakes" is framed in an abstract sense, with no direct reference to who made the mistakes. The speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word "mistakes" also does not imply intent. A less evasive [[active voice]] construction would place the focus on the actor, such as: "I made mistakes" or "John Doe made mistakes." 
* Phrasing in a way that [[Begging the question|assumes unproven claims]], or [[avoiding the question]]<ref>Staff. "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/are-these-examples-of-political-spin/7265.html Are these examples of political spin?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815015401/http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/are-these-examples-of-political-spin/7265.html |date=2012-08-15 }}". ''[[BBC Learning Zone]]''. Clip 7265. 2013.</ref>
* "Burying bad news": announcing unpopular things at a time when it is believed that the media will focus on other news. In some cases, governments have released potentially controversial reports on summer long weekends, to avoid significant news coverage. Sometimes that "other news" is supplied by deliberately announcing popular items at the same time.
* Misdirection and diversion<ref name=weissman>Weissman, Jerry. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jerry-weissman/spin-versus-topspin_b_218103.html Spin vs. Topspin]". ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. 19 June 2009.</ref>
* [[Limited hangout]]

For years, businesses have used fake or misleading [[Testimonial#Customer testimonials|customer testimonials]] by editing/spinning customers to reflect a much more satisfied experience than was actually the case. In 2009, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] updated their laws to include measures to prohibit this type of "spinning" and have been enforcing these laws as of late. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

Several companies that verify the authenticity of the testimonials businesses present on the marketing materials in an effort to convince one to become a customer have arisen.<ref>[https://business.trustedcompany.com/blog/en/testimonials-vs-verified-reviews/]</ref>
