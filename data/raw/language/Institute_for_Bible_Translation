The '''Institute for Bible Translation''' ('''IBT''') was founded in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] in 1973 by the [[Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]]-[[Croats|Croatian]] poet [[Borislav Arapović]], its main task being to publish Bibles for "non-Slavic peoples in Slavic countries," not just [[Bible translations into the languages of Russia]] but also [[Central Asian languages]].

Eighty-five million people in non-Slavic ethnic groups living in the former Soviet Union—now [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], including [[Russia]]—represent a tremendous diversity of languages (at least 130 different languages) and religions ([[Islam]], [[Buddhism]] and [[shamanism]]). The Institute for Bible Translation is also a part of the [[Forum of Bible Agencies International]].

==History of IBT==

===1970s: Reprints of 19th-century translations===
Initially IBT also republished 19thC BFBS versions which had fallen out of print, such as the Psalms in Yakut (1897, reprinted IBT 1975).<ref>Stephen K. Batalden, Kathleen Cann, John Dean ''Sowing the word: the cultural impact of the British and Foreign Bible Society'' 2004 page 221 "The edition was published in 1898 at Kazan in a print run of 3000 copies. At least one reprint was made in 1975, when with the consent of BFBS the Institute for Bible Translation (IBT) reprinted 2000"</ref>

===1980s: new translations programme===
The IBT office in [[Helsinki]] was opened in 1983. It coordinates the translation projects in 12 Finno-Ugric languages spoken in Russia. In 1988 IBT supplied 150,000 copies of the [[Aleksandr Lopukhin|Lopukhin Bible]] free of charge to the Orthodox Patriarchate. At the time this, and an earlier shipment of 100,000 copies, almost doubled the number of Bibles in circulation in the USSR.<ref>''Religion in communist lands'' Volumes 16-17 Centre for the Study of Religion and Communism - 1988 "Greater controversy has been caused by the sale of copies of the [[Lopukhin Bible]]. This was supplied entirely free of charge to the Moscow Patriarchate by Scandinavian Christians and the Stockholm-based Institute for Bible Translation (IBT). In March 1988 the Leningrad samizdat journal Nevsky dukhovny vestnik (Nevsky Spiritual Herald) reported that..."</ref>

===1990s: registration in Moscow===
Since 1995 IBT Russia/CIS ({{lang-ru|Институт перевода Библии}}) has been registered in [[Moscow]]. The staff members are from various Christian denominations. The current director is Dr. Vitaly Voinov. IBT's Moscow office coordinates the work of 65 translation teams, whose members may live in different areas or even in different countries. It arranges training courses for them and organizes seminars and conferences. The Bible texts are prepared there for printing. The Institute also produces Scripture books for children, Bible reference works and language-related research material. IBT in Russia/CIS cooperates with churches and religious organizations of all Christian denominations, national Bible Societies, scientific (academic) institutions and the state authorities.

==Translation programmes==
IBT is a member of the [[Forum of Bible Agencies International]]. In some translation projects, the institute works in partnership with other international Bible agencies, such as the [[Bible society#United Bible Societies|United Bible Societies]], the [[SIL International|SIL]]/[[Wycliffe Bible Translators]] and [[Pioneer Bible Translators]].

The aim of IBT is to produce accurate and faithful translations that reveal the Bible's message to modern readers. So far IBT has translated and published the Bible, or portions of it, in more than 80 languages, including 5 (Tajik, Georgian, Tuvin, Chechen and Udmurt) complete Bibles and 31 New Testaments. IBT's Children's Bible has been published in 38 languages.
