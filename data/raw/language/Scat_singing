[[Image:Ella Fitzgerald (1940).jpg|[[Ella Fitzgerald]] is generally considered one of the greatest scat singers in jazz history.<ref name=f282/>|thumb|upright]]

In [[vocal jazz]], '''scat singing''' is vocal [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]] with wordless vocables, [[pseudoword|nonsense syllables]] or without words at all. In scat singing, the singer improvises melodies and rhythms using the voice as an instrument rather than a speaking medium.

== Characteristics ==

=== Structure and syllable choice ===
Though scat singing is improvised, the melodic lines are often variations on [[Musical scale|scale]] and [[arpeggio]] fragments, [[lick (music)|stock patterns]] and [[riff]]s, as is the case with instrumental improvisers. As well, scatting usually incorporates musical [[Musical form|structure]]. All of [[Ella Fitzgerald]]'s scat performances of "[[How High the Moon]]", for instance, use the same [[tempo]], begin with a chorus of a straight reading of the lyric, move to a "specialty chorus" introducing the scat chorus, and then the scat itself.<ref name=f145>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=145}}</ref> [[Will Friedwald]] has compared Ella Fitzgerald to [[Chuck Jones]] directing his [[Roadrunner cartoon]]—each uses predetermined formulas in innovative ways.<ref name=f145/>

The deliberate choice of scat syllables is also a key element in vocal jazz improvisation. Syllable choice influences the pitch [[articulation (music)|articulation]], coloration, and [[Sonorant|resonance]] of the performance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|p=125}}</ref> Syllable choice also differentiated jazz singers' personal styles: [[Betty Carter]] was inclined to use sounds like "louie-ooie-la-la-la" (soft-tongued sounds or liquids) while Sarah Vaughan would prefer "shoo-doo-shoo-bee-ooo-bee" ([[fricatives]], [[plosives]], and [[open vowels]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|pp=125–126}}</ref> The choice of scat syllables can also be used to reflect the sounds of different instruments. The comparison of the scatting styles of Ella Fitzgerald and [[Sarah Vaughan]] reveals that Fitzgerald's improvisation mimics the sounds of [[swing-era]] [[big band]]s with which she performed, while Vaughan's mimics that of her accompanying [[Bebop|bop]]-era small combos.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=74}}.</ref>{{Ref label|A|a|none}}

=== Humor ===
Humor is another important element of scat singing. [[Cab Calloway]] exemplified the use of humorous scatting.<ref>{{harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=129}}</ref> Other examples of humorous scatting include [[Slim Gaillard]], [[Leo Watson]], and Bam Brown's 1945 "Avocado Seed Soup Symphony", in which the singers scat variations on the word "avocado" for much of the recording.<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=627}}</ref> In addition to such nonsensical uses of language, humor is communicated in scat singing through the use of [[musical quotation]]. Leo Watson, who performed before the canon of American popular music, frequently drew on nursery rhymes in his scatting. This is called using a compression.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=140}}</ref> The 1958 song "[[Witch Doctor (song)|Witch Doctor]]" by [[Ross Bagdasarian Sr.]], creator of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], employs the technique of humorous scatting in its chorus of nonsense syllables (oo ee oo ah ah), another one is Will Stamper with [[Emphasis on Scat]].

Ella Fitzgerald drew extensively on popular music. For example, in her 1960 recording of "[[How High the Moon]]" live in Berlin, she quotes over a dozen songs, including "[[The Peanut Vendor]]", "[[Heat Wave (Irving Berlin song)|Heat Wave]]", "[[A-Tisket, A-Tasket]]", and "[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]".<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=623}}</ref>

</div>

=== Origins ===
{{Listen|filename=Armstrongscat.ogg|title="Heebie Jeebies" excerpt|description=[[Louis Armstrong]]'s 1926 recording of "Heebie Jeebies" was the most influential early example of scat singing. — 168 KB|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Though [[Louis Armstrong]]'s 1926 recording of "[[Heebie Jeebies (composition)|Heebie Jeebies]]" is often cited as the first song to employ scatting, there are many earlier examples.<ref name="edwards">{{harvnb|Edwards|2002}}</ref> One early master of ragtime scat singing was [[Gene Greene]] who recorded scat choruses in his song "King of the Bungaloos" and several others between 1911 and 1917. Entertainer [[Al Jolson]] scatted through a few bars in the middle of his 1911 recording of "That Haunting Melody". Gene Green's 1917 "From Here to Shanghai", which featured faux-Chinese scatting, and [[Gene Rodemich]]'s 1924 "Scissor Grinder Joe" and "Some of These Days" also pre-date Armstrong.<ref name="edwards" /> Cliff "Ukulele Ike" Edwards scatted an interlude on his 1923 "Old Fashioned Love" in lieu of using an instrumental soloist.<ref name="edwards"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=16}}</ref> [[Harry Barris]], one of [[Paul Whiteman]]'s "[[The Rhythm Boys]]", along with [[Bing Crosby]], scatted on several songs, including "[[Mississippi Mud]]", which Barris wrote in 1927. One of the early female singers to use scat was [[Aileen Stanley]], who included it at the end of a duet with [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]] in their hit 1924 recording of "[[It Had To Be You (song)|It Had To Be You]]" (Victor 19373).

[[Jelly Roll Morton]] credited Joe Sims of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], as the creator of scat around the turn of the 20th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholson|1993|p=89}}</ref> Here is a transcription of a conversation between [[Alan Lomax]] and Jelly Roll Morton where Morton explains the history of scat:<ref>{{Harvnb|Hill}}</ref>
<blockquote>
'''Lomax''': Well, what about some more scat songs, that you used to sing way back then?
<br />
'''Morton''': ''Oh, I'll sing you some scat songs. That was way before Louis Armstrong's time. By the way, scat is something that a lot of people don't understand, and they begin to believe that the first scat numbers was ever done, was done by one of my hometown boys, Louie Armstrong. But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, [[Tony Jackson (jazz musician)|Tony Jackson]] and myself, and several more grabbed it in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. And found it was pretty good for an introduction of a song.''
<br />
'''Lomax''': What does scat mean?
<br />
'''Morton''': ''Scat doesn't mean anything but just something to give a song a flavor. For an instance we'll say: [launches into an example scat song, accompanying himself on the piano]''
</blockquote>

Morton also once boasted, "Tony Jackson and myself were using scat for novelty back in 1906 and 1907 when Louis Armstrong was still in the orphan's home".<ref name="edwards"/> [[Don Redman]] and [[Fletcher Henderson]] also featured scat vocals in their recording of "My Papa Doesn't Two-Time No Time" five months prior to Armstrong's 1926 recording of "Heebie Jeebies".<ref name="edwards"/>

It was Armstrong's 1926 performance, however, that was the turning point for the medium.<ref name=cp32>{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=32}}</ref> According to Armstrong, when he was recording "Heebie Jeebies", soon to be a national bestseller, with his band The Hot Five, his music fell to the ground. Not knowing the lyrics to the song, he invented a gibberish melody to fill time, expecting the cut to be thrown out in the end, but that take of the song was the one released.<ref name="edwards"/> The story is widely believed to be apocryphal.<ref>[[Scat singing#CITEREFGiddins2000|Giddins 2000]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zfn0lH_ZnGsC&pg=PA161&sig=K42BXmKH46C2zAwQnL5rzKQf9dg p.&nbsp;161].</ref> 

Armstrong served as a model for [[Cab Calloway]], whose 1930s scat solos inspired [[Gershwin]]'s use of the medium in his ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'';<ref name="grove"/> from the 1926 recording of "Heebie Jeebies" arose the techniques that would form the foundation of modern scat.<ref name=cp32/>

=== Later development ===
On October 26, 1927, [[Duke Ellington]]'s Orchestra recorded "[[Creole Love Call]]" featuring [[Adelaide Hall]] singing wordlessly.<ref>Williams, Iain Cameron. ''Underneath A Harlem Moon ... the Harlem to Paris Years of Adelaide Hall''. Continuum, 2003. {{ISBN|0826458939}}</ref> 

He describes her wordless vocals as, "really another instrument...sometimes...evocative growls".<ref>Hentoff, Nat (2001). "[https://jazztimes.com/columns/final-chorus/for-the-love-of-ivie/ For the Love of Ivie]", ''JazzTimes.com''.</ref> The creativity must be shared between Ellington and Hall as he knew the style of performance he wanted, but she was the one who was able to produce the sound. In 1932, Ellington repeated the experiment in one of his versions of "[[The Mooche]]", with Baby Cox singing scat after a muted similar trombone solo by [[Tricky Sam Nanton]].

Bands such as [[The Boswell Sisters]] regularly employed scatting on their records, including the high complexity of scatting at the same time, in harmony. An example is their version of "[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]". Another famous scat singer is [[Scatman Crothers]], who would go on to movie and television fame. [[British dance band]] trumpeter and vocalist [[Nat Gonella]] was a notable scat singer.

Over the years, as jazz music developed and grew in complexity, scat singing did as well. During the bop era, more highly developed vocal improvisation surged in popularity.<ref name="grove"/> [[Annie Ross]], a bop singer, expressed a common sentiment among vocalists at the time: "The [scat] music was so exciting, everyone wanted to do it."<ref name="cp130"/> And many did: Ella Fitzgerald, [[Eddie Jefferson]], [[Betty Carter]], [[Anita O'Day]], [[Joe Carroll (singer)|Joe Carroll]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Carmen McRae]], [[Jon Hendricks]], [[Babs Gonzales]], and [[Dizzy Gillespie]] were all singers in the idiom.<ref name="grove"/> Fitzgerald once hailed herself as the "best vocal improviser jazz has ever had", and critics since then have been in almost universal agreement with her.<ref name=f282>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=282}}</ref>

Another example is the song "Earthquake" by [[Esther Ofarim]] on the album "Is it really me?" (1965), arranged and produced by jazz man [[Bobby Scott (musician)|Bobby Scott]].<ref>http://www.esther-ofarim.de/Disco.htm</ref>

Free jazz and the influence of world musicians on the medium pushed jazz singing nearer to avant-garde art music.<ref name="grove"/> In the 1960s [[Ward Swingle]] was the product of an unusually liberal musical education. He took the scat singing idea and applied it to the works of Bach, creating [[The Swingle Singers]]. Scat singing is also featured by [[Louis Prima]] and others in the song "[[I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)|I Wan'na Be Like You]]" in Disney's ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967).

The bop revival of the 1970s renewed interest in bop scat singing, and young scat singers viewed themselves as a continuation of the classic bop tradition. The medium continues to evolve, and vocal improvisation now often develops independently of changes in instrumental jazz.<ref name="grove"/>

Jazz artist John Paul Larkin (better known as [[Scatman John]]) renewed interest in the genre briefly during the mid-1990s when he began fusing jazz singing with [[pop music]] and [[electronica]], scoring a world-wide hit with the song "[[Scatman (Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop)]]" in 1994. Vocal improviser [[Bobby McFerrin]]'s performances have shown that "wordless singing has traveled far from the concepts demonstrated by Louis Armstrong, Gladys Bentley, Cab Calloway, Anita O'Day, and Leo Watson."<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=135}}</ref>  George Benson often scatted along in unison with his guitar solos to name but one modern adaptation of the format.

[[Roger Miller]] included it as part of several hit songs, including "Dang Me", "You Can't Roller Skate in a Buffalo Herd" and "Kansas City Star". The 2002 [[Latin pop]] hit song  "[[The Ketchup Song]]" by [[Las Ketchup]] features scat singing in its chorus that is reminiscent of Spanish.<ref name=Terra>{{cite news|title=TODO LO QUE SUBE DEBE BAJAR, LO IMPORTANTE ES QUE AHORA ESTAMOS ARRIBA |url=http://terra.es/ocio/articulo/html/oci16323.htm |accessdate=24 February 2014 |newspaper=[[Terra Networks]] |date=2004 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227140115/http://terra.es/ocio/articulo/html/oci16323.htm |archivedate=27 February 2014 }}</ref>

=== Vocal bass ===
Vocal bass is a form of scat singing that is intended to vocally simulate instrumental [[basslines]] that are typically performed by bass players. A technique most commonly used by bass singers in a cappella groups is to simulate an instrumental rhythm section, often alongside a [[Mouth drumming|vocal percussionist]] or [[beatboxer]]. Some notable vocal bass artists are Tim Foust, Adam Chance, [[Bobby McFerrin]], [[Al Jarreau]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[take 6|Alvin Chea]], [[Avi Kaplan]], and [[Pentatonix|Matt Sallee]].

=== Use in hip hop  ===
Many [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artists and [[rapper]]s use scat singing to come up with the rhythms of their raps.<ref name="Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC">Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p.&nbsp;114.</ref> [[Tajai]] of the group [[Souls of Mischief]] states the following in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'': "Sometimes my rhythms come from scatting. I usually make a scat kind of skeleton and then fill in the words. I make a skeleton of the flow first, and then I put words into it."<ref name="Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC"/> The group [[Lifesavas]] describe a similar process.<ref name="Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC"/> Rapper [[Tech N9ne]] has been recorded demonstrating exactly how this method works, in an audio segment covered by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=|date=|url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/clicktrack/2010/04/how_to_rap_and_grading_hip-hop.html|work=The Washington Post|title="How to Rap" and grading hip-hop's professors|access-date=}}</ref> Gangsta rapper [[Eazy-E]] uses it extensively in his song "[[Eternal E|Eazy Street]]".

== Music historical explanations  ==
[[Image:Louis Armstrong restored.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Berliner (ethnomusicologist)|Paul Berliner]] has suggested that scat singing arose from instrumental soloists like [[Louis Armstrong]] (''pictured'') formulating jazz riffs vocally.<ref name=b181/>]]

Some writers have proposed that scat has its roots in [[African music|African musical traditions]].<ref name="grove"/> In much African music, "human voice and instruments assume a kind of musical parity" and are "at times so close in timbre and so inextricably interwoven within the music's fabric as to be nearly indistinguishable".<ref name=b68>{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|p=68}}</ref> [[Dick Higgins]] likewise attributes scat singing to traditions of [[sound poetry]] in African-American music.<ref>{{Harvnb|Higgins|1985}}</ref> In West African music, it is typical to convert drum rhythms into vocal melodies; common rhythmic patterns are assigned specific syllabic translations.<ref name="grove">{{Harvnb|Robinson}}</ref> However, this theory fails to account for the existence—even in the earliest recorded examples of scatting—of free improvisation by the vocalist.<ref name="grove"/> It is therefore more likely that scat singing evolved independently in the United States.<ref name="grove"/>

Others have proposed that scat singing arose from jazz musicians' practice of formulating riffs vocally before performing them instrumentally.<ref name=b181/> (The adage "If you can't sing it, you can't play it" was common in the early New Orleans jazz scene.<ref name=b181>{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|p=181}}</ref>) In this manner, soloists like Louis Armstrong became able to double as vocalists, switching effortlessly between instrumental solos and scatting.<ref name=b181/>

Scat singing resembles the Irish/Scottish practice of [[lilting]] or diddling, a type of vocal music that involves using nonsensical syllables to sing non-vocal dance tunes.<ref>Ó Nualláin, S. 'On tonality in Irish music' in P. McKevitt, S. Ó Nualláin and C. Mulvihill (eds) Language, Vision and Music, pp. 306-307. John Benjamins Publishing (2002)</ref>

== Critical assessment ==
Scat singing can allow jazz singers to have the same improvisational opportunities as jazz instrumentalists: scatting can be rhythmically and harmonically improvisational without concern about destroying the lyric.<ref name=cp132>{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=132}}</ref> Especially when [[bebop]] was developing, singers found scat to be the best way to adequately engage in the performance of jazz.<ref name="cp130">{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=130}}</ref>

Scatting may be desirable because it does not "taint the music with the impurity of denotation".<ref name=grant>[[Scat singing#CITEREFGrant1995|Grant 1995]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yT56t7hriTEC&pg=PA307&dq=ISBN9780822315940&sig=UyKvpmSJZosUR9lBwDB7kgMiVo4#PPA289,M1 p.289].</ref> Instead of conveying linguistic content and pointing to something outside itself, scat music—like instrumental music—is self-referential and "d[oes] what it mean[s]".<ref>{{Harvnb|Leonard|1986|p=158}}</ref> Through this wordlessness, commentators have written, scat singing can describe matters beyond words.<ref name=grant/><ref name=f37>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=37}}</ref> Music critic [[Will Friedwald]] has written that Louis Armstrong's scatting, for example, "has tapped into his own core of emotion", releasing emotions "so deep, so real" that they are unspeakable; his words "bypass our ears and our brains and go directly for our hearts and souls".<ref name=f37/>

Scat singing has never been universally accepted, even by jazz enthusiasts. Writer and critic Leonard Feather offers an extreme view; he once said that "scat singing—with only a couple exceptions—should be banned".<ref name="cp130"/> He also wrote the lyrics to the jazz song "[[Whisper Not (song)|Whisper Not]]", which Ella Fitzgerald then recorded on her 1966 Verve release of the same name. Many jazz singers, including [[Bessie Smith]], Billie Holiday, Jimmy Rushing, and Dinah Washington, have avoided scat entirely.<ref name=g162>{{Harvnb|Giddins|2000|p=162}}</ref>

== Notes ==
{{refbegin}}

'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} In her 1949 performance of "Flyin' Home", Fitzgerald alternates the bilabial "b" and "p" plosives with the alveolar plosive "d".<ref name=s65>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=65}}</ref> The "b" and "p" sounds are formed similarly to the sounds of jazz wind instruments, which sound by the release of built-up mouth air pressure onto the reed, while the "d" sound is similar to the tonguing on jazz brass instruments.<ref name=s65/> William Stewart, a Seattle researcher, has proposed that this alternation simulates the exchange of riffs between the wind and brass sections that is common in big bands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=66}}</ref> Sarah Vaughan, on the other hand, tends to use the fricative consonant "sh" along with the low, back of the mouth "ah" vowel. The "sh" closely resembles the sound of brushes, common in the bop era, on drum heads; the "ah" vowel resonates similarly to the bass drum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=69}}</ref>
