'''Pig Latin''' is a language game in which words in [[English language|English]] are altered, usually by adding a fabricated [[suffix]] or by moving the [[Syllable#Onset|onset]] or initial [[consonant]] or [[consonant cluster]] of a word to the end of the word and adding a [[vocalic]] [[syllable]] to create such a suffix.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dictionary.com/e/pig-latin/|title=What exactly is Pig Latin, is it a language? And how is it a mystery? - Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|date=2010-10-05|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}</ref> For example, Wikipedia would become Ikipediaway (taking the 'W' and 'ay' to create a suffix). The objective is to [[Obfuscation|conceal the words]] from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to [[Latin language|Latin]] is a deliberate [[misnomer]]; Pig Latin is simply a form of [[argot]] or [[jargon]] unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.

==Origins and history==
Early mentions of pig Latin or hog Latin describe what we would today call [[dog Latin]], a type of parody Latin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Examples of this predate even [[Shakespeare]], whose 1598 play, ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', includes a reference to dog Latin:<ref>{{cite web | website=The Straight Dope | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | title=What's the origin of pig Latin?}}</ref>

{{quote|'''Costard:''' Go to; thou hast it ad dungill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.<br>

An 1866 article describes a "hog latin" that has some similarities to current Pig Latin. The article says, "He adds as many new letters as the boys in their 'hog latin,' which is made use of to mystify eavesdroppers. A boy asking a friend to go with him says, 'Wig-ge you-ge go-ge wig-ge me-ge?' The other, replying in the negative, says, 'No-ge, I-ge wo-ge.' "<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IMAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA638&lpg=PA638&dq=%22He+adds+as+many+new+letters+as+the+boys+in+their+%22hog+latin,%22%22&source=bl&ots=llFXqy226B&sig=s89ZY3kpFsimFFr2f3F-gbN5KdA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjegITDjtrJAhWNoYMKHfmGACIQ6AEIGzAB#v=onepage&q=%22He%20adds%20as%20many%20new%20letters%20as%20the%20boys%20in%20their%20%22hog%20latin%2C%22%22&f=false|work=The Galaxy: A Magazine of Entertaining Reading, Volume 1|page=638|title=Sound and Sense|date=1886|author=Wakeman, George|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref>. This is similar to [[Língua do Pê]].

Another early mention of the name was in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]'' in May 1869 "I had plenty of ammunition in reserve, to say nothing, Tom, of our pig Latin. 'Hoggibus, Piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,' and all that sort of thing," although the jargon is dog Latin.

''[[The Atlantic]]'' January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: "They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with."

The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle "I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day".<ref>'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?]<br/>The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing “Pig Latin Love”. The Subtitle “I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day” indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, “(I love you dearie)”, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn’t taken root among the general public yet.</ref> [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given.  A few months prior in 1934, in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' [[short film]] ''[[Washee Ironee]]'', Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcMWkY-Wlkk#t=10m35s</ref>  [[Ginger Rogers]] sang a verse of [[We're in the Money]] in pig Latin in an elaborate [[Busby Berkeley]] production number in the film [[Gold Diggers of 1933]],  ({{cite video|title=Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin |quote=YouTube}}).  The film, the third highest grossing of that year, was inducted into the National Film Registry and that song included in the all time top 100 movie songs by the American Film Institute. [[Merle Travis]] ends his song ''When My Baby Double Talks To Me'' with the phrase, "What a aybybay", where the last word is Pig Latin for "baby".

A 1947 newspaper question and answer column describes the pig Latin as we understand it today. It describes moving the first letter to the end of a word and then adding "ay".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19470128&id=d44tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SJ0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4502,48597&hl=en|work=Reading Eagle|page=12|title=Answers to Questions - The Haskins' Service|date=28 January 1947|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref>

Two Pig Latin words that have entered into mainstream American English are "{{lang|en|[[wikt:ixnay|ixnay]]}}" or "icksnay", the Pig Latin version of "{{lang|en|[[wikt:nix#English|nix]]}}" (itself a borrowing of [[German language|German]] ''nichts''<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/127424 ''s.v.'']</ref>), which is used as a general [[Negative (language)|negative]]; and "{{lang|en|[[wikt:amscray|amscray]]}}", Pig Latin for "{{lang|en|[[wikt:scram#English|scram]]}}", meaning "go away" or "get out of here".<ref name="blake">{{cite book|last1=Blake|first1=Barry J.|title=Secret Language: Codes, Tricks, Spies, Thieves, and Symbols|date=2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAhYqpnC2H8C&pg=PR48-IA149&dq=ixnay+pig+latin&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiputrKgrnUAhUJOz4KHTRJBlUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=ixnay%20pig%20latin&f=false}}</ref><ref name="lexicogenesis">{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=D.

==Rules==
For words that begin with [[consonant]] sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added, as in the following examples:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/piglatin.htm|title=Useful phrases in Pig Latin (IgpaAtinlay)|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref>
*"pig" = "igpay"
*"latin" = "atinlay"
*"banana" = "ananabay"  
*"happy" = "appyhay"
*"duck" = "uckday"
*"me" = "emay"
*"too" = "ootay"
*"will" = "illway"
*"real" = "ealray"
*"simple" = "implesay"
*"say" = "aysay"
*"bagel" = "agelbay"
*"fail" = "ailfay"
*"poo" = "oopay"
*"party" = "artypay"
*"lonely" = "onelylay"
*"friends" = "iendsfray"
*"Lauren"" = "aurenlay"

When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Pig-Latin|title=How to Speak Pig Latin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>
*"smile" = "ilesmay"
*"string" = "ingstray"
*"stupid" = "upidstay"
*"glove" = "oveglay"
*"trash" = "ashtray"
*"floor"= "oorflay"
*"store"= "orestay"

For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" or "yay" to the end (or just "ay"). Examples are:
*"eat" = "eatway" or "eatay"
*"omelet" = "omeletway" or "omeletay"
*"are" = "areway" or "areay"
*"egg" = "eggway" or "eggay"
*"explain" = "explainway"
*"always" = "alwaysway" or "alwaysay"
*"ends" = "endsway" or "endsay"
*"honest" = "honestway"
*"I"= "Iway"

An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster. This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a more unique variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:
*"every" = "eryevay"
*"another" = "otheranay"
*"under" = "erunday"
*"island" = "andislay"
*"elegant" = "egantelay"

Sentence structure remains the same as it would in [[English language|English]]. [[Pronunciation]] of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.<!--emma  = emmway
Please do not add new examples here unless they really do follow a similar pattern as Pig Latin (moving a single phoneme cluster from one part of the word to another and adding something extra). Do not add examples of language games that generate words through different patterns (such as, for example, adding nonsense syllables in between vowels or after words, shuffling the order of syllables, or systematically replacing certain phonemes with others. The preceding list is not exhaustive). Such examples should instead be added to the [[Language game]] article.-->

==Current usage==
Pig Latin is mainly used in fun.{{cn|date=September 2018}} It is also used by children or young adults to hide conversation from older people. For example, a conversation between two people in the presence of an unwanted other may consist of: "ehay isay eryvay illysay" = "he is very silly".{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In the German-speaking area, varieties of Pig Latin include [[Kedelkloppersprook]], which originated around [[Hamburg]] harbour, and [[Mattenenglisch]] that was used in the ''Matte'', the traditional [[working class|working-class]] neighborhood of [[Bern]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Though Mattenenglisch has fallen out of use since the mid-20th century, it is still cultivated by [[voluntary association]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A characteristic of the Mattenenglisch Pig Latin is the complete substitution of the first vowel by ''i'', in addition to the usual moving of the initial consonant cluster and the adding of ''ee''.

The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspråket ("Fig language" – see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game § List of common language games]]).

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli ("container language"). After each word you add the word kontti "container", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,"wikipedia" --> "wikipedia kontti" --> "kokipedia wintti". So converting the sentence "I love you" ("Minä rakastan sinua") would result in "konä mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti".

Another equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Slavic language|Slavic]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called "Šatra" (/sha-tra/)or "[[Šatrovački]]" (/shatro-vachki/) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the Balkan slang name for [[marijuana]] (trava - meaning "grass") turns to "vutra"; the Balkan slang name for [[cocaine]] (belo - meaning "white") turns to lobe, a [[pistol]] (pištolj) turns to štoljpi, [[brother|bro]] (brate) turns to tebra. In the past few years it has become widely used between teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.

In [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.

[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louchébem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louchébem'', or ''largonji''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : Définition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10}}</ref>) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larlépem largomuche du louchébem. Parler l'argot du boucher''|author=Françoise Robert l'Argenton|publisher=Parlures argotiques|pages=113–125|language=fr|accessdate=2014-03-10|volume=90 n° 1}}</ref> In ''loucherbem'', the leading consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word (as in Pig Latin) and replaced by an ''L'', and then a suffix is added at the end of the word (-''oche'', -''em'', -''oque'', etc., depending on the word). Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienquès''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louchébem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en loucedé''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.

Verlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&sw=w&u=umpqua&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA90553064&asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.
