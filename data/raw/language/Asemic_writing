[[File:Asemic3.jpg|right|thumb|Asemic writing from Marco Giovenale]]
'''Asemic writing''' is a [[word]]less open [[Semantics|semantic]] form of [[writing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://postasemicpress.blogspot.com/2017/04/works-interviews-by-michael-jacobson-is.html|author=Michael Jacobson|title=Works & Interviews}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asemic.net/|title=Tim Gaze. Asemic Magazine|work=Asemic Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fullofcrow.com/prate/2009/11/tim-gaze/|title=Full Of Crow Tim Gaze interview}}</ref> The word ''asemic'' means "having no specific semantic content", or "without the smallest unit of meaning".<ref>From [[Greek language|Greek]]: asemos (αόεμoβ) = without sign, unmarked, obscure, or ignoble.</ref> With the non-specificity of asemic writing there comes a vacuum of meaning, which is left for the reader to fill in and interpret. All of this is similar to the way one would deduce meaning from an [[abstract art|abstract work of art]]. Where asemic writing differs from abstract art is in the asemic author's use of gestural constraint, and the retention of physical characteristics of writing such as lines and symbols. Asemic writing is a hybrid art form that fuses [[Writing|text]] and [[image]] into a unity, and then sets it free to arbitrary subjective interpretations. It may be compared to [[free writing]] or writing for its own sake, instead of writing to produce verbal context. The open nature of asemic works allows for meaning to occur across [[linguistic]] understanding; an asemic text may be "read" in a similar fashion regardless of the reader's natural language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/satu-kaikkonen-1-1.php|work=SCRIPTjr.nl|title=Satu Kaikkonen interview}}</ref> Multiple meanings for the same [[symbol]]ism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic writing can be polysemantic or have [[zero]] meaning, [[infinity|infinite]] meanings, or its meaning can evolve over time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://samplekanon.com/?p=1946/|title=Samplekannon interview with Michael Jacobson|work=Samplekannon}}</ref> Asemic works leave for the reader to decide how to [[translate]] and [[Exploration|explore]] an asemic text; in this sense, the reader becomes co-creator of the asemic work.

In 1997 [[Visual poetry|visual poets]] Tim Gaze and Jim Leftwich first applied the word ''asemic'' to name their quasi-calligraphic writing gestures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://galatearesurrects2018.blogspot.com/2018/02/featured-essay-by-jim-leftwich.html|title=Galatea Resurrects: The Nearness Of Asemic Writing by Jim Leftwich}}</ref> They then began to distribute them to [[poetry]] [[magazines]] both [[online]] and in print. The authors explored sub-verbal and sub-letteral forms of writing, and textual [[asemia]] as a creative option and as an intentional practice. Since the late 1990s, asemic writing has blossomed into a worldwide literary/[[art movement]]. It has especially grown in the early part of the 21st century, though there is an acknowledgement of a long and complex history, which precedes the activities of the current asemic movement, especially with regards to abstract calligraphy, wordless writing, and verbal writing damaged beyond the point of legibility. Jim Leftwich has recently stated that an asemic condition of an asemic work is an impossible goal, and that it is not possible to create an art/literary work entirely without meaning. He has begun to use the term "pansemic" to describe this type of work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://slowforward.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/jim-leftwich-asemic-writing-definitions-and-contexts-1998-2016/|title=Jim Leftwich: “asemic writing definitions and contexts, 1998-2016”}}</ref> Others such as author [[Travis Jeppesen]] have found the term ''asemic'' to be problematic because "it seems to infer writing with no meaning."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleek-mag.com/2016/12/02/hans-ulrich-obrist-zhang-jeppesen-miralda/|title=Hans Ulrich Obrist in Conversation About Inventing New Languages|work=Sleek Magazine}}</ref>

==Styles of asemic writing==
[[File:Crazyzhangxu.jpg|thumb|An example of Zhang Xu's calligraphy]]

Asemic writing exists in many different forms. It is often created with a [[pen]] or [[brush]], but can range from being hand drawn in the sand with a stick and documented by [[photography]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/life/arts-and-entertainment/2018-04-03-cape-town-artist-andrew-van-der-merwe-carves-out-beach-calligraphy-niche/|title=Cape Town artist Andrew van der Merwe carves out beach calligraphy niche|work=BusinessDay|author=Thelma Mort}}</ref> or to works on [[canvas]], [[paper]], [[computer]] images, and [[animations]]. The key to asemic writing is that even though it is traditionally "unreadable" it still maintains a strong attractive appeal to the reader's [[eye]]. Various asemic writing includes [[pictograms]], or [[ideograms]] the meanings of which are sometimes suggested by their shapes, though it may also flow as an [[abstract expressionist]] scribble which resembles writing but avoids words. Asemic writing, at times, exists as a conception or shadow of conventional writing practices. Reflecting writing, but not completely existing as a traditional writing system, asemic writing seeks to make the reader hover in a state between reading and looking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehandstand.org/archive//january2006/articles/nonismacemicart.htm|author=Jaime Morrison|title=Nonism: Asemic Art}}</ref> Asemic writing has no verbal sense, though it may have clear textual sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dbqp.blogspot.com/2005/11/varieties-of-visual-poetry.html|title=Varieties of Visual Poetry|work=dbqp|author=Geof Huth}}</ref> Through its formatting and structure, asemic writing may suggest a type of document and, thereby, suggest a meaning. The form of art is still writing, often [[calligraphic]] in form, and either depends on a reader's sense and knowledge of writing systems for it to make sense,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dbqp.blogspot.com/2005/11/varieties-of-visual-poetry.html|title=Varieties of Visual Poetry|work=dbqp|author=Geof Huth}}</ref> or can be understood through aesthetic intuition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://postasemicpress.blogspot.com/2017/04/works-interviews-by-michael-jacobson-is.html|author=Michael Jacobson|title=Works & Interviews}}</ref> True asemic writing occurs when the creator of the asemic piece cannot read their own asemic writing. Relative asemic writing is a natural writing system that can be read by some people but not by everyone (e.g. [[ciphers]], [[wildstyle]], etc.). Most asemic writing lies between these two extremes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fullofcrow.com/prate/2009/08/michael-jacobson/|title=PRATE, Michael Jacobson interview|publisher=Fullofcrow.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> Influences on asemic writing are illegible, [[Constructed language|invented]], or primal [[manuscript|script]]s ([[cave painting]]s, [[doodle]]s, children's drawings, etc.). But instead of being thought of as mimicry of preliterate expression, asemic writing may be considered to be a global [[Postliterate society|postliterate]] style of writing that uses all forms of creativity for inspiration. Other influences on asemic writing are [[alien language in science fiction|alien languages in science fiction]], [[artistic languages]], [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] (magick), [[undeciphered scripts]], and [[graffiti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scriptjr.nl/special-sections/cryptotexts/michael-jacobson-interview#.VBCXA2Nrucs|work=SCRIPTjr.nl|title=Michael Jacobson interview| accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> Uses for asemic writing include mental and [[Creativity|creative]] [[idea]] stimulation, [[non-verbal communication]], [[hoaxes]], and general authorial self-expression.

===History===

[[File:MirthaDermisacheNewsletter.jpg|thumb|left | Newsletter from Mirtha Dermisache<ref>dermisache-9 Newsletters & 1 Reportaje 2000: Newsletter, 2000 from Mirtha Dermisache, Nueve Newsletters & Un Reportaje, Buenos Aires : El borde, Marseille : Mobil-Home, Montpellier : Manglar, 2004. Offset printing, 440 copies.</ref>]]
Asemic writing occurs in [[avant-garde]] literature and art with strong roots in the [[Proto-writing|earliest forms of writing]]. The history of today's asemic movement stems from two [[China|Chinese]] calligraphers: "crazy" [[Zhang Xu]], a [[Tang Dynasty]] (circa 800 CE) calligrapher who was famous for creating wild illegible calligraphy, and the younger "drunk" [[monk]] [[Huaisu]] who also excelled at illegible [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]] calligraphy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centerforbookarts.blogspot.com/2014/07/making-sense-of-asemic-writing.html|title=Center for Book Arts: Making Sense of Asemic Writing|author=Sarah Nicholls|publisher=Centerforbookarts.blogspot.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> [[Japanese people|Japanese]] calligraphers subsequently expanded upon Chinese abstract calligraphic expression by [[Hitsuzendō]] (the way of [[Zen]] through brush), allowing their works to move past formal presentation and "breathe with the vitality of eternal experience". During the 18th century the [[Ireland|Irish]] author [[Laurence Sterne]] included asemic lines in his novel ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1759), adding the graphic device to help tell the [[Narrative|story]] "in a tolerably straight line". In the 1920s [[Man Ray]], who was influenced by [[Dada]], created an early work of wordless writing with his poem ''[[Paris]], Mai 1924'', which is nothing more than dashes on a page. Later in the 1920s, [[Henri Michaux]], who was influenced by Asian calligraphy, [[Surrealism]], and [[Automatic writing]], began to create wordless works such as ''Alphabet'' (1925) and ''Narration'' (1927).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://natalieferrisdotcom.wordpress.com/2014/01/26/leaking-the-squalls-the-art-and-letters-of-henri-michaux/|title=‘Leaking the Squalls': The Art and Letters of Henri Michaux|work=natalie ferris|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> Michaux referred to his calligraphic works as "interior Gestures". The writer and artist [[Wassily Kandinsky]] was an early precursor to asemic writing, with his linear piece ''Indian Story'' (1931) exemplifying complete textual abstraction. In the 1950s there is [[Brion Gysin]] (whose calligraphy was influenced by [[Arabic]] and Japanese calligraphy), [[Isidore Isou]] (who founded [[Lettrisme]]), [[Cy Twombly]] (a former US Army [[Cryptologist]]), and [[Morita Shiryū]]/[[Bokujin-kai]] Group (Ink Human Society)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vermillionmedia.blogspot.com/2013/08/calligraphy-bokujin-kai-group-and.html|title= Calligraphy The Bokujin-Kai Group and Shiryu Morita|publisher=infinity of utterances kathryn simon phd}}</ref> all of whom expanded writing into illegible, abstract, and wordless visual mark-making; they would help lay the foundation for asemic writers of the future. [[Mira Schendel]] was an artist from [[Brazil]] who created many illegible works over the course of her life, for example her piece ''Archaic Writing'' (1964). [[Mirtha Dermisache]] is another writer who had created asemic writing since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/commentary/witness-mirtha-dermisache|title=Witness Mirtha Dermisache|publisher=Jacket2.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> Dermisache actively said that even though her graphisms have no meaning, they still retained the full rights of an autonomous work. 1971 was the year when [[:fr:Alain Satié|Alain Satié]] released his work ''Écrit en prose ou L'Œuvre hypergraphique'' which contains asemic writing throughout the entire graphic novel.<ref>Alain Satie, Écrit en Prose, Éditions PSI, 1971.</ref> [[León Ferrari]] was another artist/poet who created many asemic works in the 1960s and 70s, such as ''Escritura'' (1976).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.printmag.com/illustration/the-writing-of-art-the-art-of-writing/|author=Buzz Poole|title=The Writing of Art, The Art of Writing|publisher=Printmag.com}}</ref> 1974 saw the release of [[Max Ernst]]'s work ''Maximiliana: The Illegal Practice Of Astronomy: hommage à Dorothea Tanning''; this book is a major influence on asemic writers such as Tim Gaze, Michael Jacobson, and [[Derek Beaulieu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fullofcrow.com/prate/2009/08/michael-jacobson/|title=PRATE|publisher=Fullofcrow.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> [[Roland Barthes]] was also involved with asemic writing; he titled his asemic works Contre-écritures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2012/12/05/vispo/|title=Vispo|author=Tierra Innovation|publisher=Theparisreview.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drawingsonwriting.org/page25.htm|title=Drawings on Writing|publisher=Drawingsonwriting.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

A modern example of asemic writing is [[Luigi Serafini (artist)|Luigi Serafini]]'s ''[[Codex Seraphinianus]]'' (1981). Serafini described the script of the Codex as asemic in a talk at the [[Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles]] held on May 8, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Stanley|date=2010|title=To Read Images Not Words: Computer-Aided Analysis of the Handwriting in the Codex Seraphinianus (MSc dissertation)|publisher=North Carolina State University at Raleigh|pages=8–9|accessdate=9 April 2012|url=http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/6460/1/etd.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>  In the 1980s [[Chinese people|Chinese]] artist [[Xu Bing]] created ''Tiānshū'', or ''[[A Book from the Sky]]'' which is a work of books and hanging scrolls on which were printed 4000 hand carved meaningless characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crab.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/free-writing/|title=Free writing|work=stalker|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> The 1980s also saw artist [[Gu Wenda]] begin the first of a series of projects centered on the invention of meaningless, false Chinese ideograms, depicted as if they were truly old and traditional. One exhibition of this type was held in [[Xi'an]] in 1986, featuring paintings of fake ideograms on a massive scale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lacon4.wordpress.com/tag/asemic-writing-2/|title=asemic writing - Donna Tull|publisher=Lacon4.wordpress.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>  Also in China, during the 1990s, an abstract calligraphy movement known as "Calligraphy-ism" came into existence, a leading proponent of this movement being Luo Qi. Calligraphy-ism is an aesthetic movement that aims to
develop calligraphy into an abstract art. The characters do not need to retain their traditional forms or be legible as words. In [[Vietnam]] during the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] a calligraphy group called the Zenei Gang of Five appeared. To this group of young artists, “Wordless” means that which cannot be said, that which is both before and beyond the specificity of naming. To be without words is saying nothing and saying everything.

===Specialized publications===
2013 saw the release of ''An Anthology of Asemic Handwriting'' (Uitgeverij), which has over a hundred artists represented from many corners of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uitgeverij.cc/product/an-anthology-of-asemic-handwriting/ |title=An Anthology Of Asemic Handwriting}}</ref> Asemic writing has also received mention and space in ''The Last Vispo Anthology: Visual Poetry 1998-2008'' ([[Fantagraphics]], 2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantagraphics.com/lastvispoanthology/ |title=The Last Vispo Anthology|work= Crag Hill & Nico Vassilakis (editors)}}</ref> In 2011 a full issue of [[William Allegrezza]]'s poetry journal ''Moria'' was focused on the participants and theory of asemic writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moriapoetry.com/i134v141.html|title=moria|publisher=Moriapoetry.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> Also in 2011, John Moore Williams published an asemic issue of his journal ''The Bleed.''

Satu Kaikkonen, a contemporary asemic artist/writer from [[Finland]], had this to say about asemic writing:

{{Quotation|As a creator of asemics, I consider myself an explorer and a global storyteller. Asemic art, after all, represents a kind of language that's universal and lodged deep within our unconscious minds. Regardless of language identity, each human's initial attempts to create written language look very similar and, often, quite asemic. In this way, asemic art can serve as a sort of common language—albeit an abstract, post-literate one—that we can use to understand one another regardless of background or nationality. For all its limping-functionality, semantic language all too often divides and asymmetrically empowers while asemic texts can't help but put people of all literacy-levels and identities on equal footing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/satu-kaikkonen-1-1.php|title=SCRIPTjr.nl|work=SCRIPTjr.nl|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>}}

[[Bruce Sterling]] comments about asemic writing on his [[Wired magazine]] blog ''Beyond the Beyond'': {{Quotation|Writing that doesn’t have any actual writing in it whatsoever. You would think that this must be some kind of ultimate literary frontier, a frozen [[Antarctica]] of writing entirely devoid of literary content, but I wonder.

What is “beyond asemic writing”? Maybe a neural brain-scan of an author *thinking about* asemic writing. Maybe *generative asemic writing*. Maybe “asemic biomimicry”. Maybe nanoasemic writing inscribed with atomic force microscopes by Artificial Intelligences.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/07/web-semantics-asemic-writing/ |title=Web Semantics: Asemic writing |date=July 13, 2009 |last=Sterling |first=Bruce |work=[[Wired.com]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}</ref>}}

==False writing systems==
'''False writing systems''' are artificially constructed [[alphabet]]s or scripts used (sometimes within the context of a [[false document]]) to convey a degree of [[wikt:verisimilitude|verisimilitude]]. Examples of this include alien dialogue in comic strips, [[animated cartoons]], and [[graphic novel]]s (such as [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', and the ''[[Valérian and Laureline]]'' series).
The script in [[Luigi Serafini (artist)|Luigi Serafini]]'s 1981 ''[[Codex Seraphinianus]]'' was confirmed by the author to have no occult meaning. The [[Voynich manuscript]], a mysterious work on which the ''Codex Seraphinianus'' was likely based, uses an [[undeciphered writing system]] that some speculated to be false.
