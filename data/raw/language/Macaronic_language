'''Macaronic language''' refers to text using a mixture of [[language]]s,<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/macaronic|title=Macaronic|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022203122/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/macaronic|archivedate=22 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> particularly [[bilingual pun]]s or situations in which the languages are otherwise used in the same context (rather than simply discrete segments of a text being in different languages). The term can also denote [[hybrid word]]s, which are effectively "internally macaronic". A rough equivalent in spoken language is [[code-switching]], a term in [[linguistics]] referring to using more than one language or dialect within the same conversation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2012/04/12.html |title=Definition of Macaronic |publisher=dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419181212/http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2012/04/12.html |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

'''Macaronic Latin''' in particular is a jumbled [[jargon]] made up of [[vernacular]] words given [[Latin language|Latin]] endings, or of Latin words mixed with the vernacular in a [[pastiche]] (compare [[dog Latin]]).

The word ''[[wikt:Macaronic|macaronic]]'' comes from the [[New Latin]] ''macaronicus'' which is from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''maccarone'' ("dumpling", regarded as coarse peasant fare).  The term can have derogatory overtones, and is usually reserved for works where the mixing of languages has a humorous or [[satire|satirical]] intent or effect.  It is a matter of debate whether the term can be applied to mixed-language literature of a more serious nature and purpose.

==History==

===Mixed Latin-vernacular lyrics in Medieval Europe===
Texts that mixed [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[vernacular language]] apparently arose throughout Europe at the end of the [[Middle Ages]]—a time when Latin was still the working language of scholars, clerics and university students, but was losing ground to vernacular among poets, [[minstrel]]s and storytellers.

An early example is from 1130, in the [[Gospel book]] of [[Munsterbilzen Abbey]].  The following sentence mixes late [[Old Dutch]] and Latin:

<blockquote>
<poem>
Tesi samanunga was edele unde scona
et omnium virtutum pleniter plena
</poem>
</blockquote>

Translated: ''This community was noble and pure, and completely full of all virtues.''

The ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' (collected c.1230) contains several poems mixing Latin with Medieval German or French.  Another well-known example is the first stanza of the famous [[Carol (music)|carol]] ''[[In Dulci Jubilo]]'', whose original version (written around 1328) had Latin mixed with German, with a hint of [[Greek language|Greek]].  While some of those early works had a clear humorous intent, many use the language mix for lyrical effect.

Another early example is in the [[Middle English language|Middle English]] recitals ''[[Wakefield Mystery Plays|The Towneley Plays]]'' (c.1460).  In ''[[The Talents (play)|The Talents]]'' (play 24), [[Pontius Pilate]] delivers a rhyming speech in mixed English and Latin.

A number of English political poems in the 14th century alternated (Middle) English and Latin lines, such as in MS Digby 196:
<blockquote><poem>The taxe hath tened [ruined] vs alle,
      Probat hoc mors tot validorum
  The Kyng þerof had small
      fuit in manibus cupidorum.
  yt had ful hard hansell,
      dans causam fine dolorum;
  vengeaunce nedes most fall,
      propter peccata malorum
  ''(etc)''</poem></blockquote>

Several [[Anthem]]s also contain both Latin and English. In the case of 'Nolo mortem pecatoris' by [[Thomas Morley]], the Latin is used as a refrain:
<blockquote>
<poem>
Nolo mortem peccatoris; Haec sunt verba Salvatoris.
Father I am thine only Son, sent down from heav’n mankind to save.
Father, all things fulfilled and done according to thy will, I have.
Father, my will now all is this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.
Father, behold my painful smart, taken for man on ev’ry side;
Ev'n from my birth to death most tart, no kind of pain I have denied,
but suffered all, and all for this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.
</poem>
</blockquote>

Translated: "'I do not wish the death of the wicked'; These are the words of the Saviour." An allusion to John 3:17 and 2 Peter 3:9.

===Latin–Italian macaronic verse===
The term ''macaronic'' is believed to have originated in [[Padua]] in the late 15th century, apparently from ''maccarona'', a kind of pasta or [[dumpling]] eaten by peasants at that time.  (That is also the presumed origin of  ''[[maccheroni]]''.)<ref name="linphil">{{cite web |author=Fran Hamilton |url=http://porticobooks.com/edu/archive/issue55.htm |title=LinguaPhile online magazine, September 2007 |publisher=Porticobooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210181651/http://porticobooks.com/edu/archive/issue55.htm |archivedate=10 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Its association with the genre comes from the ''[[Macaronea]]'', a comical poem by [[Tifi Odasi]] in mixed Latin and Italian, published in 1488 or 1489.  Another example of the genre is ''[[Tosontea]]'' by [[Corrado of Padua]], which was published at about the same time as Tifi's ''Macaronea''.

Tifi and his contemporaries clearly intended to [[satire|satirize]] the broken Latin used by many doctors, scholars and bureaucrats of their time.  While this "macaronic Latin" (''macaronica verba'') could be due to ignorance or carelessness, it could also be the result of its speakers trying to make themselves understood by the vulgar folk without resorting to their speech.<ref name="macver">{{cite web |author=Giorgio Bernardi Perini |title=Macaronica Verba.

An important and unusual example of mixed-language text is the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' of [[Francesco Colonna]] (1499), which was basically written using Italian syntax and morphology, but using a made-up vocabulary based on roots from Latin, [[Greek (language)|Greek]], and occasionally others.  However, while the ''Hypnerotomachia'' is contemporary with Tifi's ''Macaronea'', its mixed language is not used for plain humor, but rather as an aesthetic device to underscore the fantastic but refined nature of the book.

Tifi's ''Macaronea'' was a popular success, and the writing of [[humour|humorous]] texts in macaronic Latin became a fad in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in Italian, but also in many other European languages. An important Italian example was ''[[Baldo (Teofilo Folengo book)|Baldo]]'' by [[Teofilo Folengo]], who described his own verses as "a gross, rude, and rustic mixture of flour, cheese, and butter".<ref name="folenmac">The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, Oxford University Press (1996)</ref><ref name="caten">{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06124a.htm |title=Teofilo Folengo in The Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1909-09-01 |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022034217/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06124a.htm |archivedate=22 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Other mixed-language lyrics===
Macaronic verse is especially common in cultures with widespread [[bilingualism]] or [[language contact]], such as Ireland before the middle of the nineteenth century.  Macaronic traditional songs such as ''[[Siúil A Rúin]]'' are quite common in Ireland.  In Scotland, macaronic songs have been popular among [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] immigrants to [[Glasgow]], using English and [[Scottish Gaelic]] as a device to express the alien nature of the anglophone environment.  An example:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/primary/tunein/mixer/lyrics.shtml?lyrics=3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425195304/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/primary/tunein/mixer/lyrics.shtml?lyrics=3 |archivedate=25 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Folk and popular music of the [[Andes]] frequently alternates between Spanish and the given [[South American]] language of its region of origin.

Some [[Persian poetry|Classical Persian poems]] were written with alternating [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] verses or hemistichs, most famously by [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sadi-sirazi|title=SAʿDI – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|date=|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117020202/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sadi-sirazi|archivedate=17 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Hafez Shirazi|Hafez]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hafez-iii|title=HAFEZ   iii.

Macaronic verse was also common in [[medieval]] [[India]], where the influence of the Muslim rulers led to poems being written in alternating indigenous [[Hindi]] and the [[Persian language]].  This style was used by the famous poet [[Amir Khusro]] and played a major role in the rise of the [[Urdu]] or [[Hindustani language]].

The [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] song "Caress Me Down" alternates between English and Spanish lyrics, at some points between verses, at others between lines within a verse, and occasionally between phrases within a line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/caress-me-down-lyrics-sublime.html|title=Sublime - Caress Me Down Lyrics - MetroLyrics|author=|date=|website=www.metrolyrics.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426200541/http://www.metrolyrics.com/caress-me-down-lyrics-sublime.html|archivedate=26 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Unintentional macaronic language===
{{main|Homophonic translation}}

Occasionally language is unintentionally macaronic. One particularly famed piece of schoolyard Greek in France is [[Xenophon]]'s line "they did not take the city; but in fact they had no hope of taking it" ({{lang|grc|οὐκ ἔλαβον πόλιν· άλλα γὰρ ἐλπὶς ἔφη κακά}}, ''ouk élabon pólin; álla gàr elpìs éphē kaká''). [[Mondegreen|Read]] [[Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching#France|in the French manner]], this becomes "Où qu'est la bonne Pauline? A la gare. Elle pisse et fait caca." ("Where is Pauline the maid? At the [railway] station. She's pissing and taking a shit.")<ref>Arbre d'Or eBooks.

==Modern macaronic literature==

===Prose===
Macaronic text is still used by modern Italian authors, e.g. by [[Carlo Emilio Gadda]] and [[Beppe Fenoglio]].  Other examples are provided by the character Salvatore in [[Umberto Eco]]'s  ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', and the peasant hero of his ''[[Baudolino]]''.  [[Dario Fo]]'s ''[[Mistero Buffo]]'' ("''Comic Mystery Play''") features [[grammelot]] sketches using language with macaronic elements.

The 2001 novel ''[[The Last Samurai (novel)|The Last Samurai]]'' by [[Helen DeWitt]]<ref name="lastsam">DeWitt, Helen. ''The Last Samurai'' (Chatto and Windus, 2000: {{ISBN|0-7011-6956-7}}; Vintage, 2001: {{ISBN|0-09-928462-6}})</ref> includes portions of Japanese, [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]], and [[Inuktitut]], although the reader is not expected to understand the passages that are not in English.

Macaronic games are used by the literary group [[Oulipo]] in the form of interlinguistic [[homophonic transformation]]: replacing
a known phrase with homophones from another language.  The archetypal example is by [[François Le Lionnais]], who transformed [[John Keats]]' "A thing of beauty is a joy forever" into "Un singe de beauté est un jouet pour l'hiver": 'A monkey of beauty is a toy for the winter'.<ref name="genette">{{cite book

Macaronisms figure prominently in ''[[The Trilogy]]'' by the [[Poland|Polish]] novelist [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], and are one of the major compositional principles for James Joyce's novel ''Finnegans Wake''.

===Poetry===
Two well-known examples of non-humorous macaronic verse are [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Maid of Athens, ere we part (George Byron)|Maid of Athens, ere we part]]'' (1810, in English with a [[Greek language|Greek]] refrain);<ref name="maidat">{{cite web |first=George |last=Byron |url=http://readytogoebooks.com/MOA-P43.htm |title=Maid of Athens |publisher=readytogoebooks.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070133/http://readytogoebooks.com/MOA-P43.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and [[Robert Lucas de Pearsall|Pearsall]]'s translation of the carol ''In Dulci Jubilo'' (1837, in mixed English and Latin verse).

An example of modern humorous macaronic verse is the anonymous English/Latin poem ''[[Carmen Possum]]'' ("''The Opossum's Song''"), which is sometimes used as a teaching and motivational aid in elementary Latin language classes.  Other similar examples are ''[[The Motor Bus]]'' by [[A. D. Godley]], and the anonymous ''[[Up I arose (poem)|Up I arose in verno tempore]]''.

Recent examples are the ''mużajki'' or 'mosaics' (2007) of [[Malta|Maltese]] poet [[Antoine Cassar]]<ref name="mosaics">Grech, Marija. [http://www.alwatan.com.kw/Default.aspx?MgDid=537975&pageId=327 "Mosaics: A symphony of multilingual poetry"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328134017/http://www.alwatan.com.kw/Default.aspx?MgDid=537975&pageId=327 |date=28 March 2009 }}, ''The Daily Star'' (Kuwait), 25 August 2007</ref> mixing English, Spanish, [[Maltese language|Maltese]], Italian, and French; works of Italian writer [[Guido Monte]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/genesis-creation/ |title=see for ex. |publisher=Wordswithoutborders.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092233/http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/genesis-creation/ |archivedate=12 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the late poetry of Ivan Blatný combining Czech with English.<ref name="Blatny">Wheatley, David.

''Contemporary Poetry Review'', 2008.</ref> 

[[Brian P. Cleary]]'s "What Can I C'est?" makes use of macaronic verse, as do other poems in his book "Rainbow Soup: Adventures in Poetry":

<blockquote>My auntie Michelle is big in the BON<br />
(As well as the hip and the thigh).<br />
And when she exhales, OUI haul out our sails<br />
And ride on the wind of VERSAILLES.</blockquote>

A whole body of comic verse exists created by John O'Mill, pseudonym of [[John O'Mill|Johan van der Meulen]], a teacher of English at the Rijks HBS (State Grammar School), [[Breda]], the [[Netherlands]].  These are in a mixture of English and Dutch, often playing on common mistakes made when translating from the latter to the former.

===Theatre===
The finale of act 1 of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Savoy Opera]] [[Iolanthe]] has several instances of humorous macaronic verse. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stagebeauty.net/plays/th-iola1.html|title=W.S.Gilbert - Iolanthe, ACT I|author=|date=|website=www.stagebeauty.net|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425195304/http://www.stagebeauty.net/plays/th-iola1.html|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

First, the three Lords mix Italian and Latin phrases into their discussion of Iolanthe's age:
<blockquote>'''Lord Mountararat:''' This gentleman is seen, / With a maid of seventeen, / A-taking of his ''dolce far niente''...<br />
'''Lord Chancellor:''' Recollect yourself, I pray, / And be careful what you say- / As the ancient Romans said, ''festina lente''...<br />
'''Lord Tolloller:''' I have often had a use / For a thorough-bred excuse / Of a sudden (which is English for ''repente'')...<br />
'''Lord Mountararat:''' Now, listen, pray to me, / For this paradox will be / Carried, nobody at all ''contradicente''...</blockquote>

Then, the chorus of peers sing macaronic verse as they attempt to resist the fairies' powers:
<blockquote>Our lordly style you shall not quench with base ''canaille''! (That word is French.)<br /> 	 
Distinction ebbs before a herd of vulgar ''plebs''! (A Latin word.)<br />
Twould fill with joy and madness stark the ''oι πoλλoί''! (A Greek remark.)<br /> 	 
One Latin word, one Greek remark, and one that's French.</blockquote>

===Film===
'Macaronisms' are frequently used in films, especially comedies.  In [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] comedy ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', the title character  speaks English mixed with a parody of German (e.g. "Cheese-und-cracken").  This was also used by Benzino Napaloni, the parody character of [[Benito Mussolini]], using Italian foods (such as [[salami]] and [[ravioli]]) as insults.

Other movies featuring macaronic language are the Italian historical comedies ''[[L'armata Brancaleone]]'' and ''[[Brancaleone alle crociate]]'' (d. [[Mario Monicelli]]), which mix modern and medieval Italian as well as Latin (sometimes in rhyme, and sometimes with regional connotations, such as the [[Italo-Normans]] using words from modern [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]).

===Song===

Macaronic language appearing in popular songs include [[Dean Martin]]'s "[[That's Amore]]" (Italian and English), [[Rammstein]]'s "[[Amerika (song)|Amerika]]" (German and English), the [[Beatles]]’ "[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]" (French and English), [[The Clash]]’s "[[Spanish Bombs]]" and [[José Feliciano]]’s "[[Feliz Navidad (song)|Feliz Navidad]]" (Spanish and English), the [[Talking Heads]] "[[Psycho Killer]]" (French and English), and [[The Weeknd]]'s [[Echoes of Silence|Montreal]] (French and English).
