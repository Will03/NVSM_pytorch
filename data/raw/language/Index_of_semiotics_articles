The following is a list of '''semiotics terms'''; that is, those words used in discussion, classification, criticism, and analysis of the study of sign processes ([[semiosis]]), analogy, metaphor, signification and communication, [[sign (semiotics)|signs]] and [[symbols]]. Note: in order to help the reader this page also includes terms which are not part of semiotic theory per se but which are commonly found alongside their semiotic brethren - these terms come from linguistics, literary theory and narratology.
