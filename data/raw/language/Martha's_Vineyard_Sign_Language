'''Martha's Vineyard Sign Language''' ('''MVSL''') was a [[village sign language|village sign-language]] that was once widely used on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]] from the early 18th century to 1952. It was used by both [[deaf]] and [[Hearing (person)|hearing]] people in the community; consequently, deafness did not become a barrier to participation in public life. Deaf people who spoke Martha's Vineyard Sign Language were extremely independent. They participated in society as typical citizens, although there were incidents of discrimination, and [[language barrier]]s.

The language was able to thrive because of the unusually high percentage of deaf islanders and because deafness was a [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[hereditary trait|trait]], which meant that almost anyone might have both deaf and hearing siblings. In 1854, when the island's deaf population peaked, the United States national average was one deaf person in about 5,730, while on Martha's Vineyard it was one in 155. In the town of [[Chilmark, Massachusetts|Chilmark]], which had the highest concentration of deaf people on the island, the average was 1 in 25; at one point, in a section of Chilmark called Squibnocket, as much as 1 in 4 of the population of 60 was deaf.<ref name="library">{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.chilmarklibrary.org/pdf/|title=Chilmark Deaf Community Digital Historical Archive|website=catalog.chilmarklibrary.org|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>

[[Sign language]] on the island declined when the population migrated to the mainland. There are no fluent signers of MVSL today. Katie West, the last deaf person born into the island's sign-language tradition, died in 1952,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/09/marthas-vineyard-sign-language-asl/407191/|title=The Life and Death of Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|last=Romm|first=Cari|date=2015-09-25|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref> though there were a few elderly residents still able to recall MVSL when researchers started examining the language in the 1980s.<ref name=library/> Linguists are working to save the language, but their task is difficult because they cannot experience MVSL firsthand.

== Origins ==
Hereditary deafness had appeared on Martha's Vineyard by 1714. The ancestry of most of the deaf population of Martha's Vineyard can be traced to a forested area in the south of England known as [[Weald|the Weald]]—specifically the part of the Weald in the county of [[Kent]].<ref name="library" /> Martha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL) may be descended from a hypothesized sign language of that area in the 16th century, now referred to as [[Old Kent Sign Language]]. Families from a [[Puritan]] community in the Kentish Weald emigrated to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in [[British America]] in the early 17th century, and many of their descendants later settled on Martha's Vineyard. The first deaf person known to have settled there was Jonathan Lambert, a carpenter and farmer, who moved there with his wife—who was not deaf—in 1694. By 1710, the migration had virtually ceased, and the [[endogamous]] community that was created contained a high incidence of hereditary deafness that persisted for over 200 years.

In the town of [[Chilmark, Massachusetts|Chilmark]], which had the highest concentration of deaf people on the island, the average was 1 in 25; at one point, in a section of Chilmark called Squibnocket, as much as 1 in 4 of the population of 60 was deaf.<ref name="library" /> By the 18th century there was a distinct [[Chilmark Sign Language]]. In the 19th century, this was influenced by [[French Sign Language]], and evolved into MVSL in the 19th and 20th centuries. From the late 18th to the early 20th century, virtually everybody on Martha's Vineyard possessed some degree of fluency in the language.

== Deaf migration to the mainland ==
In the early 19th century, a new educational philosophy began to emerge on the mainland, and the country's first school for the deaf opened in 1817 in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (now called the [[American School for the Deaf]]). Many of the deaf children of Martha's Vineyard enrolled there, taking their sign language with them. The language of the teachers was [[French Sign Language]], and many of the other deaf students used their own [[home sign|home-sign]] systems. This school became known as the birthplace of the [[deaf community]] in the United States, and the different sign systems used there, including MVSL, merged to become [[American Sign Language]] or ASL—now one of the largest community languages in the country.

As more deaf people remained on the mainland, and others who returned brought with them deaf spouses they met there (whose hearing loss may not have been due to the same hereditary cause), the line of hereditary deafness began to diminish. At the outset of the 20th century, the previously isolated community of fishers and farmers began to see an influx of tourists that would become a mainstay in the island's economy. Jobs in tourism were not as deaf-friendly as fishing and farming had been, and as intermarriage and migration joined the people of Martha's Vineyard to the mainland, the island community grew to resemble the wider community there more and more.

The last deaf person born into the island's sign-language tradition, Katie West, died in 1952.<ref name=":0" /> A few elderly residents were able to recall MVSL as recently as the 1980s when research into the language began. Indeed, when [[Oliver Sacks]] subsequently visited the island after reading a book on the subject,<ref name="Groce1985">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K5nbuza--nYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=everyone+here+sign#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language: Hereditary Deafness on Martha's Vineyard|last=Groce|first=Nora Ellen|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-674-27041-X|location=Cambridge, MA|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> he noted that a group of elderly islanders talking together dropped briefly into sign language then back into speech.<ref name="Sacks">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOjavKkVRNoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22seeing+voices%22#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Seeing Voices: a Journey into the World of the Deaf|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1989|isbn=0-520-06083-0|pages=35–36|authorlink=Oliver Sacks|place=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>

== Life as a deaf person on Martha's Vineyard ==

Although the people who were dependent on MVSL were different, they still did the same activities as the normal Martha's Vineyard resident would. The deaf would work both complex and simple jobs, attend island events, and participate within the community. In contrast to some other deaf communities around the world, they were treated as normal people. The deaf living in rural Mexico have a similar community, but few hearing people live there permanently.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dehn |first=Georgia |year=2015 |title=Signs of Life |url= |journal=Daily Telegraph |volume= |pages= |via=}}</ref> Other deaf communities are often isolated from the hearing population; the Martha's Vineyard deaf community of that period is exceptional in its integration into the general population.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language |last=Groce |first=Nora |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=10–14}}</ref>

Deaf MVSL users were not excluded by the rest of society at Martha's Vineyard, but they certainly faced challenges due to their deafness. Marriage between a deaf person and a hearing person was extremely difficult to maintain, even though both could use MVSL. For this reason, the deaf usually married the deaf, raising the degree of inbreeding even beyond that of the general population of Martha's Vineyard.<ref>{{Cite journal |last= Perlmutter |first=David |year=1986 |title=No Nearer to the Soul |jstor= 4047641 |journal= Natural Language and Linguistic Theory 	 |volume=4|pages=515–23  |doi=10.1007/bf00134471}}</ref> These deaf-deaf marriages are what really increased the deaf population within this community.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal |last=Kusters |first=A. |date=2010-01-01 |title=Deaf Utopias?

For example, children signed behind a schoolteacher's back, adults signed to one another during church sermons, farmers signed to their children across a wide field, and fishermen signed to each other from their boats across the water where the spoken word would not carry.<ref name="Groce1985" />

Outside of Martha's Vineyard, though, deaf people were discriminated against. This drove them to try hard to be accepted by locals, which also explains why at first the cochlear implants were not utilized.<ref name=":12"/>

== Decline ==
Martha's Vineyard Sign Language declined after the opening of the [[American School for the Deaf]]. Although students from Martha's Vineyard influenced the creation of [[American Sign Language]] with contributions from MVSL, when they returned home, they brought ASL usage back with them, and MVSL faded. Additionally, as transportation became easier in the 19th century, the influx of hearing people meant that more genetic diversity was introduced, and hereditary deafness was no longer commonplace. The last person in the line of hereditary deafness of Martha's Vineyard was Katie West, who died in 1952. Following her death, Oliver Sacks noted in the 1980s that some elderly hearing residents of the island could remember a few signs, but the language truly died out after this point.<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Seeing Voices|Seeing Voices: A Journey Into the World of the Deaf]]|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|authorlink=Oliver Sacks|date=1989|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=0520060830|location=Berkeley|oclc=19455916}}</ref>
