[[File:Simlish.svg|thumb|Written Simlish that can be read as "Simlish"]]

'''Simlish''' is a [[fictional language]] featured in [[EA Games]]' ''Sim'' series of games.  It debuted in ''[[SimCopter]]'', and has been especially prominent in ''[[The Sims]]'' franchise, as well as in its spinoff ''[[MySims]]'' series. Simlish can also be heard in ''[[SimCity 4]]'', ''[[SimCity Societies]]'', [[SimCity (2013 video game)|''SimCity'' (2013 version)]], and ''[[SimCity BuildIt]]'' but far less frequently.  Civilized Creatures in ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' can also be taught to speak Simlish.  It is also featured to an extent in [[Firaxis Games]]' ''[[Sid Meier's SimGolf]]''.  

==Development==
Simlish was created because [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], creator of ''The Sims'', knew that the game needed dialogue, but thought that using real-life languages such as English would cause the dialogue to be repetitive and would be expensive translating the entire dialog Sims may say. He also decided that Simlish worked best as a "language" made up of [[gibberish]] words that could not be translated, so that the dialogue's meanings would be left open to the imagination of the player.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/ngc/previews/the-sims-bustin--out-e72277.html |title=The Sims Bustin' Out Designer Diary #3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106145215/http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/ngc/previews/the-sims-bustin--out-e72277.html |archivedate=January 6, 2006}}</ref> Wright later commented that using a nonsense language turned out to be the right development choice, as people were capable of imagining it more realistically than a computer could simulate a real language.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=New Scientist|publisher=Reed Business Information|volume=199|issue=2675|title=Interview: The games master|author=Celeste Biever|date=24 September 2008}}</ref> The actual sound of Simlish was [[Improvisational theatre|improvised]] by [[voice actor]]s Stephen Kearin and [[Gerri Lawlor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gaming.savvy-cafe.com/2008/09/gonna-play-the-sims-you-gotta-speak-simlish/ |title=Gonna Play the Sims?

One of Wright's biggest concerns while developing ''The Sims'' was that giving the characters actual dialog would have gotten extremely repetitive, because even if Wright were able to fit five CDs worth of voice clips in the game, players would eventually start hearing the same voice clips over and over again. He found that this problem persisted even when using Navajo or [[Estonian language|Estonian]], but because the gibberish of Simlish was so far removed from any existing human language, it is very difficult for players to find repeats in it. The team went out to record hundreds of voice clips in Simlish, each with their own unique cadence and emotional nuance. Wright wanted the player to be able to tell whether a Sim is feeling flirtatious, upset, laid back, or tired, based entirely on their tone and tempo.<ref>{{cite book|title=Game Design Theory & Practice|version=Second Edition|publisher=Wordware Publishing, Inc.|last=Rouse III|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Rouse III|year=2005|isbn=1-55622-912-7|page=431}}</ref>

==Music==
Sims can listen to Simlish music on cheap [[boombox]]es or fancy [[stereo]]s; since ''[[The Sims: Hot Date|Hot Date]]'', they have also heard music on wall speakers on Community lots.

In ''[[The Sims (video game)#Expansion packs|The Sims: House Party]]'' and ''[[The Sims (video game)#Expansion packs|The Sims: Vacation]]'', Sims sing Simlish campfire songs. They are sung to the tune of "[[She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain]]", "[[Michael Row the Boat Ashore]]" and "[[On Top of Old Smoky]]". Lyrics for these songs were posted on the official website. A free full-length soundtrack album for ''[[The Sims (video game)#Expansion packs|The Sims: Superstar]]'' has also been released for download (complete with cover art), with several tracks sung in Simlish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesims.ea.com/us/getcool/graphics/superstar_cd.html |title=Make Your Own Superstar Soundtrack CD!|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930214326/http://thesims.ea.com/us/getcool/graphics/superstar_cd.html |archivedate=September 30, 2011 | website=Thesims.ea.com}}</ref>

In The Sims 4, there have been songs that have been covered in Simlish in the Seasons expansion pack.

For [[The Urbz: Sims in the City]], The Black Eyed Peas provided music translated into Simlish, including their award-winning song "[[Let's Get It Started]]".

==Written Simlish==
[[Information sign|Signs]] in ''The Sims'' games usually do not contain text, instead consisting entirely of [[graphics]]. For example, a pet shop sign in ''Unleashed'' displays a paw, a [[stop sign]] in ''Hot Date'' displays a white hand, and in ''[[The Sims 2]]'' the sign for a [[grocery store]] depicts a [[cornucopia]].

In ''The Sims'', the headline ''The [[SimCity]] Times'' is visible on the daily [[newspaper]], in English and in a font similar to [[Comic Sans MS]]. 

In ''The Sims 2'', most text is only distinguishable at very close zooms. On book covers, newspapers and ''Nightlife's'' "Sims Must [[hand washing|Wash Hands]]" sign, the lettering is all nonsense characters that bear about as much resemblance to Latin characters as they do to [[Cyrillic]]. Almost no actual characters from any known alphabet are used. When Sims are writing [[novel]]s or term papers, [[dingbat]]s from the [[Wingdings]] font appear as text on the screen. The notebooks used for [[homework]] contain writing composed of random lines.

In ''The Sims 2'', Simlish words occasionally appear on television screens. They are written in the same Simlish alphabet described above, or using the font [[Wingdings]] to produce symbols like [[Aum]] or [[Zodiac]] signs. In ''The Sims 2 University'', eight "SimGreek" letters appeared as signs intended for [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] houses. ''University'' also contains the most unambiguous existence of actual English language in the whole The Sims 2 series; the words ''"Open house"'' are shown on a decorative noteboard on the top right announcement various times. It can only be seen at a very close zoom and is slightly garbled because of the [[S3 Texture Compression|DXT]] [[Data compression|compression]] used. Most other appearances of English are logos for Maxis, Electronic Arts, or [[GameSpot]]. Also, the video games [[SSX 3]], [[The Sims Bustin' Out]], [[SimCity 4]] and [[The Sims 3]] (available exclusively in Mr. Humble's Computer object in FreeTime, brought by Mr. Humble, a [[Rod Humble]] Sim character), found on the Sims' computers and TVs have numbers and English letters and a rug from the H&M Fashion stuff pack features the letters H&M. The marketing of [[The Sims 2: FreeTime]] contains excerpts from phony "hobby magazines" with front cover text bearing some resemblance to the Latin alphabet. For instance, one magazine about car restoration has a title which can be read as ''Skitbil'', literally meaning ''Shit Car'' or ''Crappy Car'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

In ''The Sims 3'', the written form of Simlish became much more consistent than its predecessors. All decorative objects, in-game televisions, public buildings and clothing objects developed and released by EA and Maxis stayed consistent in their decorative usage. This format was occasionally broken, however, usually when content was released through sponsorship deals with entities including [[Katy Perry]], [[Diesel (brand)|Diesel]] and [[Toyota]]; this discontinuity was seen as unfavorable to some players who believed it broke the immersion of the game for the sake of advertising.<ref>{{cite web|title=Things I've Seen/Heard/Read About in The Sims 3: Diesel Stuff|url=http://www.modthesims.info/archive/index.php?t-476049.html}}</ref>

In ''[[The Sims 4]]'', Simlish is almost always used in any places where writing would normally be, if not replaced by symbols.

Sleeping Sims are illustrated by [[Z]]s floating around their heads.

When a [[vehicle]] arrives on the lot, the license plate shows Arabic numbers; similarly, [[police cars]] in the game have the numbers [[300 (number)|329]] on top of them. [[Helipad]]s also have an H written on them, as in real life. When a Sim plays on electronic entertainment, "EA Games" is in English, but "Challenge Everything" is in Simlish.

Even though there is no official and consistent Simlish alphabet, many independent custom content creators have been using letters of the [[Greek alphabet]] instead of Latin ones. The Greek letters that replace the Latin ones are similar in form, sound or usage. For instance, the word "example" would be written as "εχαμπλε" or "εχαμρλε". The alphabet is consistent within a title but can shift between titles. For example, the Simlish in ''The Sims 3'' and later has a more rounded look and an increased use of circles in the glyphs.

In ''[[The Sims Online]]'', however, all text is in English. This is also the case in 2013's [[SimCity (2013 video game)|''SimCity'']].

In a trailer for ''The Sims 3'', a billboard in the town displays the English words ''Coming Soon'', albeit with the letters rotated in different directions. The rest of the text on the billboard is in the usual Simlish, and is unreadable.

== Outside ''The Sims'' ==
Nearly all games in the ''Sim'' series use Simlish in the same manner that ''The Sims'' does. For instance, in ''[[SimCity 4]]'', ''[[SimCity Societies]]'' and 2013's ''[[SimCity (2013 video game)|SimCity]]'', citizens can be heard conversing if one zooms in enough{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. In a similar manner, creatures created with a primate mouth in ''Spore'' will also converse in Simlish, and hovering above a city will trigger gibberish conversation from the masses below.  During the Civilization stage, this can be heard when the player selects active vehicles. Also, in other regional versions of the game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'', Steve, an entity found in the center of the galaxy, will speak Simlish instead of the chosen language; although in the American version he speaks in the chosen language.
