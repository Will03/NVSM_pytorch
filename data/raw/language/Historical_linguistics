==History and development==
Western modern historical [[linguistics]] dates from the late 18th century.  It grew out of the earlier discipline of [[philology]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Linguistics: An Introduction|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1998|isbn=978 0 7486 4601 2|location=Edinburgh|pages=391}}</ref> the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to [[wikt:antiquity|antiquity]].

At first, historical linguistics served as the cornerstone of [[comparative linguistics]] primarily as a tool for linguistic reconstruction.<ref name="Routledge introduction">"Editors' Introduction: Foundations of the new historical linguistics." In. ''The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics'' Routledge p.&nbsp;25.</ref>  Scholars were concerned chiefly with establishing language families and reconstructing prehistoric proto-languages, using the [[comparative method]] and [[internal reconstruction]].<ref name="Routledge introduction" /> The focus was initially on the well-known [[Indo-European languages]], many of which had long written histories; the scholars also studied the [[Uralic languages]], another European language family for which less early written material exists. Since then, there has been significant comparative linguistic work expanding outside of European languages as well, such as on the [[Austronesian languages]] and various families of [[Native American languages]], among many others. Comparative linguistics is now, however, only a part of a more broadly conceived discipline of historical linguistics. For the Indo-European languages, comparative study is now a highly specialized field.  Most research is being carried out on the subsequent development of these languages, in particular, the development of the modern standard varieties.

Some scholars have undertaken studies attempting to establish super-families, linking, for example, Indo-European, Uralic, and other families into [[Nostratic]].  These attempts have not been accepted widely.  The information necessary to establish relatedness becomes less available as the time depth is increased. The time-depth of linguistic methods is limited due to chance word resemblances and variations between language groups, but a limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baldi|first=Philip|year=2012|title=Historical Linguistics and Cognitive Science|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Publications/External/Baldi_Dussias_Rhesis_2012_GD_09_13_2012.pdf|journal=Rheis, International Journal of Linguistics, Philology and Literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5–27}} p.&nbsp;11.</ref> The dating of the various proto-languages is also difficult; several methods are available for dating, but only approximate results can be obtained.

==Diachronic and synchronic analysis==
{{See also|Synchrony and diachrony}}
Initially, ''all'' modern linguistics was historical in orientation. Even the study of modern dialects involved looking at their origins. [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s distinction between [[synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic]] and diachronic linguistics is fundamental to the present day organization of the discipline. Primacy is accorded to synchronic linguistics, and '''diachronic linguistics''' is defined as the study of successive synchronic stages. Saussure's clear demarcation, however, has had both defenders and critics.

In linguistics, a '''synchronic analysis''' is one that views linguistic phenomena only at a given time, usually the present, though a synchronic analysis of a historical language form is also possible.  This may be distinguished from diachronic, which regards a phenomenon in terms of developments through time.  Diachronic analysis is the main concern of historical linguistics; however, most other branches of linguistics are concerned with some form of synchronic analysis. The study of language change offers a valuable insight into the state of linguistic representation, and because all synchronic forms are the result of historically evolving diachronic changes, the ability to explain linguistic constructions necessitates a focus on diachronic processes.<ref>Bybee, Joan L. "Diachronic Linguistics." The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics, June 2010.</ref>

In practice, a purely synchronic linguistics is not possible for any period before the invention of the [[phonograph|gramophone]], as written records always lag behind speech in reflecting linguistic developments. Written records are difficult to date accurately before the development of the modern [[title page]]. Often dating must rely on contextual historical evidence such as inscriptions, or, modern technology such as carbon dating can be used to ascertain dates of varying accuracy. Also, the work of [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]] on linguistic variation has shown synchronic states are not uniform: the speech habits of older and younger speakers differ in ways that point to language change. Synchronic variation is linguistic change in progress.

Synchronic and diachronic approaches can reach quite different conclusions. For example, a [[Germanic strong verb]] like English ''sing – sang – sung'' is [[regular verb|irregular]] when viewed synchronically: the native speaker's brain [[neurolinguistics|processes]] these as learned forms, whereas the derived forms of regular verbs are processed quite differently, by the application of productive rules (for example, adding ''-ed'' to the basic form of a verb as in ''walk – walked''). This is an insight of [[psycholinguistics]], relevant also for [[Second language acquisition|language didactics]], both of which are synchronic disciplines.  However, a diachronic analysis will show that the strong verb is the remnant of a fully regular system of internal vowel changes, in this case, namely, the [[Indo-European ablaut]]; historical linguistics seldom uses the category "[[irregular verb]]".

The principal tools of research in diachronic linguistics are the [[comparative method]] and the method of [[internal reconstruction]]. Less-standard techniques, such as [[mass lexical comparison]], are used by some linguists to overcome the limitations of the comparative method, but most linguists regard them as unreliable.

The findings of historical linguistics are often used as a basis for hypotheses about the groupings and movements of peoples, particularly in the prehistoric period. In practice, however, it is often unclear how to integrate the linguistic evidence with the [[archaeological]] or [[Genetics|genetic]] evidence. For example, there are numerous theories concerning the homeland and early movements of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]], each with its own interpretation of the archaeological record.

===Comparative linguistics===
[[Comparative linguistics]] (originally '''comparative [[philology]]''') is a branch of historical linguistics that is concerned with comparing languages in order to establish their historical relatedness. Languages may be related by convergence through [[Borrowing (linguistics)|borrowing]] or by genetic descent, thus languages can change and are also able to cross-relate.

[[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|Genetic relatedness]] implies a common origin or [[proto-language]]. Comparative linguistics has the goal of constructing [[language family|language families]], reconstructing proto-languages, and specifying the changes that have resulted in the documented languages.  To maintain a clear distinction between [[attested language]] and reconstructed forms, comparative linguists prefix an asterisk to any form that is not found in surviving texts.

===Etymology===
[[Etymology]] is the study of the [[history]] of [[word]]s: when they entered a language, from what source, and how their form and meaning have changed over time. A word may enter a language as a [[loanword]] (as a word from one language adopted by speakers of another language), through [[derivational morphology]] by combining pre-existing elements in the language, by a hybrid of these two processes called [[phono-semantic matching]], or in several other minor ways.

In languages with a long and detailed history, etymology makes use of [[philology]], the study of how words change from culture to culture over time. Etymologists also apply the methods of [[comparative linguistics]] to reconstruct information about languages that are too old for any direct information (such as writing) to be known. By analyzing related languages with a technique known as the [[comparative method]], linguists can make inferences, about their shared parent language and its vocabulary. In that way, [[root (linguistics)|word roots]] that can be traced all the way back to the origin of, for instance, the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]] have been found. Although originating in the philological tradition, much current etymological research is done in [[language family|language families]] for which little or no early documentation is available, such as [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]].

===Dialectology===
{{Main|Dialectology}}
[[Dialectology]] is the scientific study of linguistic [[dialect]], the varieties of a language that are characteristic of particular groups, based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features.  This is in contrast to variations based on social factors, which are studied in [[sociolinguistics]], or variations based on time, which are studied in historical linguistics. Dialectology treats such topics as divergence of two local dialects from a common ancestor and [[descriptive linguistics|synchronic variation]].

Dialectologists are concerned with grammatical features that correspond to regional areas. Thus, they are usually dealing with populations living in specific locales for generations without moving, but also with immigrant groups bringing their languages to new settlements.

===Phonology===
{{Main|Sound change}}
[[Phonology]] is a sub-field of linguistics which studies the [[sound]] system of a specific language or set of languages. Whereas [[phonetics]] is about the physical production and [[perception]] of the sounds of speech, phonology describes the way sounds function within a given language or across languages.

An important part of phonology is studying which sounds are distinctive units within a language. For example, the "p" in "pin" is [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]], but the "p" in "spin" is not. In English these two sounds are used in [[complementary distribution]] and are not used to differentiate words so they are considered [[allophones]] of the same [[phoneme]]. In some other languages like [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the same difference of aspiration or non-aspiration differentiates words and so the two sounds (or [[phones]]) are therefore considered phonemes.

In addition to the minimal meaningful sounds (the phonemes), phonology studies how sounds alternate, such as the /p/ in English, and topics such as [[syllable]] structure, [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[accent (dialect)|accent]], and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].

The principles of phonological theory have also been applied to the analysis of [[sign language]]s, but the phonological units do not consist of sounds. The principles of phonological analysis can be applied independently of [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] because they are designed to serve as general analytical tools, not language-specific ones.

===Morphology===
[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] is the study of the formal means of expression in a language; in the context of historical linguistics, how the formal means of expression change over time; for instance, languages with complex inflectional systems tend to be subject to a simplification process.
This field studies the internal structure of words as a formal means of expression.<ref>A ''formal language'' is a set of words, i.e. finite strings of letters or symbols. The inventory from which these letters are taken is the ''alphabet'' through which the language is defined. A formal language is often defined by means of a [[formal grammar]], but it does not describe their [[semantics]] (i.e., what they mean).</ref>

Words as units in the lexicon are the subject matter of [[lexicology]]. While words are generally accepted as being (with [[clitic]]s) the smallest units of [[syntax]], it is clear that, in most (if not all) languages, words can be related to other words by rules. The rules understood by the speaker reflect specific patterns (or regularities) in the way words are formed from smaller units and how those smaller units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word-formation within and across languages, and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages, in the context of historical linguistics, how the means of expression change over time. See [[grammaticalisation]].

===Syntax===
[[Syntax]] is the study of the principles and rules for constructing [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in [[natural language]]s. The term ''syntax'' is used to refer directly to the rules and principles that govern the sentence structure of any individual language, as in "the [[Irish syntax|syntax of Modern Irish]]". Modern researchers in syntax attempt to [[descriptive linguistics|describe languages]] in terms of such rules. Many professionals in this discipline attempt to find [[Universal Grammar|general rules]] that apply to all natural languages in the context of historical linguistics, how characteristics of sentence structure in related languages changed over time. See [[grammaticalisation]].

== Rates of change and varieties of adaptation ==
{{main|Conservative (language)}}
Studies in historical linguistics often use the terms "[[conservative (language)|conservative]]" or "innovative" to characterize the extent of change occurring in a particular language or dialect as compared with related varieties. In particular, a ''conservative'' variety changes relatively less than an ''innovative'' variety. These variations in plasticity are often related to the socio-economic situation of the language speakers. An example of an innovative language would be the [[American English]] language because of the vast number of speakers and the open interaction these speakers have with other language groups; these changes can be seen in the terms developed for business and marketing, among other fields such as technology. The converse of the innovative language is the conservative language, and these are generally defined by their static nature and imperviousness to outside influences. Most of these languages are spoken in secluded areas that lack any other primary language speaking population, however this is not a guarantee. These descriptive terms carry no value judgment in linguistic studies, and are not used to determine any form of worthiness a language has compared to any other language.

A particularly conservative variety that preserves features that have long since vanished elsewhere is sometimes said to be "[[Archaism|archaic]]". While there are few examples of archaic language in modern society, some have survived in [[set phrase]]s or in nursery rhymes.

== Evolutionary context ==
In terms of evolutionary theory, historical linguistics (as opposed to research into the [[origin of language|origins of human language]]) studies [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] [[inheritance of acquired characteristics|acquired characteristics]] of languages.<ref>

| quote                 = [...] biological evolution does not proceed by the transmission of acquired characters across generations, and this is precisely what an evolutionary model of language change requires. We therefore must distinguish the cultural, or Lamarckian, evolution of language, a concern of historical linguistics, from its biological, or neo-Darwinian, evolution, a concern of developmental biology.
