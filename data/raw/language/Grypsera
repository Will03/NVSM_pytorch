'''Grypsera''' ({{IPA-pl|ɡrɨˈpsɛra}}; from [[Low German]] ''Gripps'' meaning "intelligence", "cleverness") is a distinct [[nonstandard dialect]] of the [[Polish language]], used traditionally by [[Recidivism|recidivist prison inmates]].<ref name="pwn">{{cite web|title=grypsera - Encyklopedia PWN|url=https://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/grypsera;3908413.html|publisher=[[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN]]|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> It evolved in the 19th century in the areas of the [[Partitions of Poland|Russian partition]], and the prison colloquially called [[Gęsiówka]] is said to be the place where it originated.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rodasik|first1=Radosława|last2=Ćwiertnia|first2=Ewelina|last3=Zat’ko|first3=Jozef|title=Język podkultury więziennej – gwara. język migowy, tatuaż|journal=Kultura Bezpieczeństwa.

The basic [[substratum|substrate]] of the dialect is Polish, but with many notable influences (mostly lexical) from other languages used in Polish lands at that time, most notably [[Yiddish]], [[German language|German]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and  [[Russian language|Russian]]. It was also heavily influenced by various [[dialects of Polish|regional dialect]]s of the Polish language, most notably the [[Bałak jargon]] of [[Lviv|Lwów]] and the [[Warsaw dialect]].

Initially it served the role of a [[cant (language)|cant]], or "secret language", but in the late 19th century it became a standard [[sociolect]] of criminals. Grypsera is constantly evolving to maintain the status of a language understood only by a select group of inmates and not by the wardens or informers. Because of this it is currently one of the lexically richest dialects of the Polish language. Also, it is not possible to prepare a comprehensive dictionary of the dialect since it differs from prison to prison.

Phonetically, Grypsera is similar to the [[Warsaw dialect]] and shares its most notable features of assimilation of {{angle bracket|i}} {{IPA-pl|i|}} into {{angle bracket|y}} {{IPA-pl|ɨ|}} and the disappearance of [[nasal vowel]]s, especially in word-final [[syllable]]s.
