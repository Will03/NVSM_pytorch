'''Nonsense''' is a [[Linguistics|communication]], via [[speech]], [[writing]], or any other [[symbolic system]], that lacks any coherent [[semantics|meaning]]. Sometimes in ordinary usage, nonsense is synonymous with [[absurdity]] or the [[ridiculous]]. Many [[poet]]s, [[novelist]]s and [[songwriter]]s have used nonsense in their works, often creating entire works using it for reasons ranging from pure comic amusement or satire, to illustrating a point about language or reasoning. In the philosophy of language and philosophy of science, nonsense is distinguished from [[sense]] or meaningfulness, and attempts have been made to come up with a [[coherence (linguistics)|coherent]] and [[consistent]] method of distinguishing sense from nonsense. It is also an important field of study in [[cryptography]] regarding separating a [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].

{{Main|Literary nonsense}}
The phrase "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" was coined by [[Noam Chomsky]] as an example of nonsense. However, this can easily be confused with [[poetic symbolism]]. The individual ''words'' make sense and are arranged according to proper [[grammar|grammatical rules]], yet the result is nonsense. The inspiration for this attempt at creating verbal nonsense came from the idea of [[contradiction]] and seemingly irrelevant and/or incompatible characteristics, which conspire to make the phrase meaningless, but are open to interpretation. The phrase "the square root of Tuesday" (not a similar example; the lemondrop sunshine is more comparable){{vague|date=June 2014}} operates on the latter principle. This principle is behind the inscrutability of the ''[[kōan]]'' "What is the sound of one hand clapping?", where one hand would presumably be insufficient for clapping without the intervention of another.

[[James Joyce]]’s final novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' also uses nonsense: full of [[portmanteau]] and strong words, it ''appears'' to be pregnant with multiple layers of meaning, but in many passages it is difficult to say whether any one human's interpretation of a text could be the intended or unintended one.

=== Verse ===
''[[Jabberwocky]]'', a [[Poetry|poem]] (of [[nonsense verse]]) found in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] (1871), is a nonsense poem written in the English language. The word ''jabberwocky'' is also occasionally used as a synonym of nonsense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jabberwocky|title=the definition of Jabberwocky|website=Dictionary.com}}</ref>

Nonsense verse is the verse form of literary nonsense, a genre that can manifest in many other ways.  Its best-known exponent is [[Edward Lear]], author of ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'' and hundreds of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]].

Nonsense verse is part of a long line of tradition predating Lear: the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'' could also be termed a nonsense verse. There are also some works which ''appear'' to be nonsense verse, but actually are not, such as the popular 1940s song [[Mairzy Doats]].

Lewis Carroll, seeking a nonsense riddle, once posed the question ''How is a [[common raven|raven]] like a writing desk?''. Someone answered him, ''Because [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] wrote on both''. However, there are other possible answers (e.g. ''both have inky [[quill]]s'').

Lines of nonsense frequently figure in the [[refrain]]s of [[Folk music|folksong]]s, where nonsense [[riddle]]s and [[knock-knock joke]]s are often encountered.

== Philosophy of language and of science ==
{{Further|Sense}}
In the [[philosophy of language]] and the [[philosophy of science]], nonsense refers to a lack of [[sense]] or [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]. Different technical definitions of meaning delineate sense from nonsense.

=== Logical positivism ===
{{Further|Logical positivism}}

=== Wittgenstein ===
{{Further|Ludwig Wittgenstein}}
In [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s writings, the word "nonsense" carries a special technical meaning which differs significantly from the normal use of the word.  In this sense, "nonsense" does not refer to meaningless gibberish, but rather to the lack of sense in the context of [[sense and reference]].  In this context, logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and purely mathematical propositions may be regarded as "nonsense". For example, "1+1=2" is a nonsensical proposition.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=md-KV6HUueUC&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=wittgenstein+tautology+nonsense|title=Wittgenstein: the way out of the fly-bottle |first=Severin |last=Schroeder |publisher=Polity |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7456-2615-4 |page=110}}</ref> Wittgenstein wrote in [[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus]] that some of the propositions contained in his own book should be regarded as nonsense.<ref>Biletzki, Anat and Anat Matar, "Ludwig Wittgenstein", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition) "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#Sen ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']"</ref> Used in this way, "nonsense" does not necessarily carry negative connotations.

Starting from Wittgenstein, but through an original perspective, the Italian philosopher Leonardo Vittorio Arena, in his book ''Nonsense as the meaning'', highlights this positive meaning of nonsense to undermine every philosophical conception which does not take note of the absolute lack of meaning of the world and life. Nonsense implies the destruction of all views or opinions, on the wake of the Indian Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna. In the name of nonsense, it is finally refused the conception of duality and the Aristotelian formal logic.

==Cryptography==
The problem of distinguishing sense from nonsense is important in [[cryptography]] and other [[intelligence agency|intelligence]] fields.  For example, they need to distinguish [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].  [[Cryptanalysis|Cryptanalysts]] have devised [[algorithm]]s to determine whether a given text is in fact nonsense or not. These algorithms typically analyze the presence of repetitions and [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] in a text; in meaningful texts, certain frequently used words recur, for example, ''the'', ''is'' and ''and'' in a text in the [[English language]]. A [[Randomness|random]] scattering of letters, punctuation marks and spaces do not exhibit these regularities. [[Zipf's law]] attempts to state this analysis mathematically. By contrast, cryptographers typically seek to make their [[cipher]] texts resemble random distributions, to avoid telltale repetitions and patterns which may give an opening for cryptanalysis.

It is harder for cryptographers to deal with the presence or absence of meaning in a text in which the level of redundancy and repetition is ''higher'' than found in [[natural language]]s (for example, in the mysterious text of the [[Voynich manuscript]]).

== Teaching machines to talk nonsense ==
{{See also|SCIgen}}
Scientists have attempted to teach machines to produce nonsense.  The Markov chain technique is one method which has been used to generate texts by algorithm and randomizing techniques that seem meaningful. Another method is sometimes called the ''[[Mad Libs]]'' method: it involves creating templates for various [[Sentence (linguistics)#By structure|sentence structures]] and filling in the blanks with [[noun phrase]]s or [[verb phrase]]s; these phrase-generation procedures can be looped to add [[recursion]], giving the output the appearance of greater complexity and sophistication. [[Racter]] was a computer program which generated nonsense texts by this method; however, Racter's book, ''The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed'', proved to have been the product of heavy human editing of the program's output.
