'''Universal language''' may refer to a hypothetical or historical language spoken and understood by all or most of the world's population.  In some contexts, it refers to a means of communication said to be understood by all living things, beings, and objects alike.  It may be the idea of an [[international auxiliary language]] for communication between groups speaking different primary languages.  In other conceptions, it may be the primary language of all speakers, or the only existing language.   Some religious and mythological traditions state that there was once a single universal language among all people, or shared by humans and [[supernatural]] beings.

In other traditions, there is less interest in or a general deflection of the question. For example in [[Islam]] the [[Arabic language]] is the language of the [[Qur'an]], and so universal for Muslims. The written [[Classical Chinese|Classical Chinese language]] was and is still read widely but pronounced differently by readers in [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]; for centuries it was a ''[[de facto]]'' universal ''literary'' language for a broad-based culture. In something of the same way [[Sanskrit]] in [[India]] and [[Nepal]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Pali]] in [[Sri Lanka]] and in [[Theravada]] countries of [[South-East Asia]] ([[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]]), were literary languages for many for whom they were not their [[mother tongue]].

Comparably, the [[Latin|Latin language]] (''qua'' [[Medieval Latin]]) was in effect a universal language of [[Intellectual|literati]] in the [[Middle Ages]], and the language of the [[Vulgate Bible]] in the area of [[Catholicism]], which covered most of Western [[Europe]] and parts of Northern and Central Europe also.

In a more practical fashion, trade languages, such as ancient [[Koine Greek]], may be seen as a kind of ''real'' universal language, that was used for commerce.

In [[historical linguistics]], [[monogenesis (linguistics)|monogenesis]] refers to the idea that all spoken human languages are descended from a single ancestral language spoken many thousands of years ago.

==Mythological and religious universal languages==
{{main|Mythical origins of language|Adamic language|Divine language|Language of the birds}}
Various religious texts, myths, and legends describe a state of humanity in which originally only one language was spoken.

In [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs, the story of the [[Tower of Babel]] tells of a consequent "[[confusion of tongues]]" (the splintering of numerous languages from an original [[Adamic language]]) as a punishment from God.

Myths exist in other cultures describing the creation of multiple languages as an act of a god as well, such as the destruction of a 'knowledge tree' by [[Brahma]] in Indic tradition, or as a gift from the God [[Hermes]] in Greek myth. Other myths describe the creation of different languages as concurrent with the creation of different tribes of people, or due to supernatural events.

== Early modern history ==
{{further|Philosophical language}}
Recognizable strands in the contemporary ideas on universal languages took form only in [[Early Modern]] Europe. A ''[[lingua franca]]'' or trade language was nothing very new; but  an [[international auxiliary language]] was a natural wish in light of the gradual decline of Latin. Literature in vernacular languages became more prominent with the [[Renaissance]]. Over the course of the 18th century, learned works largely ceased to be written in [[Latin]]. According to Colton Booth (''Origin and Authority in Seventeenth-Century England'' (1994) p.&nbsp;174) "The Renaissance had no single view of Adamic language and its relation to human understanding." The question was more exactly posed in the work of [[Francis Bacon]].

In the vast writings of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] can be found many elements relating to a possible universal language, specifically a [[constructed language]], a concept that gradually came to replace that of a rationalized Latin as the natural basis for a projected universal language. Leibniz conceived of a ''[[characteristica universalis]]'' (also see ''[[mathesis universalis]]''), an "algebra" capable of expressing all conceptual thought. This algebra would include rules for symbolic manipulation, what he called a ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]'' . His goal was to put [[reasoning]] on a firmer basis by reducing much of it to a matter of calculation that many could grasp. The ''characteristica'' would build on an [[alphabet of human thought]].

Leibniz's work is bracketed by some earlier mathematical ideas of [[René Descartes]], and the satirical attack of [[Voltaire]] on [[Panglossianism]]. Descartes's ambitions were far more modest than Leibniz's, and also far more successful, as shown by his wedding of [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] to yield what we now know as [[analytic geometry]]. Decades of research on [[symbolic artificial intelligence]] have not brought Leibniz's dream of a ''characteristica'' any closer to fruition.

Other 17th-century proposals for a 'philosophical' (i.e. universal) language include those by [[Francis Lodwick]], [[Thomas Urquhart]] (possibly parodic), [[George Dalgarno]] (''Ars signorum'', 1661), and [[John Wilkins]] (''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language]]'', 1668). The classification scheme in [[Peter Mark Roget|Roget]]'s [[Thesaurus]] ultimately derives from Wilkins's ''Essay''.

''[[Candide]]'', a [[satire]] written by [[Voltaire]], took aim at Leibniz as [[Dr. Pangloss]], with the choice of name clearly putting universal language in his sights, but satirizing mainly the [[optimism]] of the projector as much as the project. The argument takes the universal language itself no more seriously than the ideas  of the speculative scientists and ''virtuosi'' of [[Jonathan Swift]]'s [[Laputa]]. For the like-minded of Voltaire's generation, universal language was tarred as [[fool's gold]] with the same brush as [[philology]] with little [[intellectual rigour]], and universal [[mythography]], as futile and arid directions.

In the 18th century, some rationalist natural philosophers sought to recover a supposed [[Edenic language]]. It was assumed that education inevitably took people away from an innate state of goodness they possessed, and therefore there was an attempt to see what language a human child brought up in utter silence would speak. This was assumed to be the Edenic tongue, or at least the [[lapsarian]] tongue.

Others attempted to find a common linguistic ancestor to all tongues; there were, therefore, multiple attempts to relate esoteric languages to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (e.g. [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Irish language|Irish]]), as well as the beginnings of [[comparative linguistics]].

==Modern history==
{{Further|World language}}
At the end of the 19th century, there was a large profusion of constructed languages intended as genuine, spoken language. There were created languages which don't belong to any country and can be learned by everyone. Among these are [[Solresol]], [[Volapük language|Volapük]], and [[Esperanto]], the most spoken constructed language today. At that time, those ideas were readily accepted. With the advent of World Wars and the Cold War, these successes were buried. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The constructed language movement produced such languages as  [[Latino Sine Flexione]] (1903), [[Ido (language)|Ido]] (1907), [[Occidental language|Occidental]] (1922), and [[Interlingua]] (1951).<ref>[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]]'', New York: Storm Publishers, 1951.</ref>

English remains the dominant language of international business and global communication through the influence of global media and the former British Empire that had established the use of English in regions around the world such as North America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. However, English is not the only language used in global organizations such as in the EU or the UN, because many countries do not recognize English as a universal language.

The early ideas of a universal language with complete conceptual classification by categories is still debated on various levels. [[Michel Foucault]] believed such classifications to be subjective, citing [[Borges]]' fictional [[Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge's Taxonomy]] as an illustrative example.
