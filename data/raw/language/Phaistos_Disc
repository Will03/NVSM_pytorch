[[File:Phaistos 01.jpg|thumb|260px|Palace complex at [[Phaistos]]]]
The '''Phaistos Disc''' (also spelled '''Phaistos Disk''', '''Phaestos Disc''') is a disk of fired [[clay]] from the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palace of [[Phaistos]] on the island of [[Crete]], possibly dating to the middle or late Minoan [[Bronze Age]] ([[second millennium B.C.]]). The disk is about 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) in diameter and covered on both sides with a spiral of stamped symbols. Its purpose and meaning, and even its original geographical place of manufacture, remain disputed, making it one of the most famous mysteries of [[archaeology]]. This unique object is now on display at the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum|archaeological museum]] of [[Heraklion]].

The disc was discovered in 1908 by the Italian archaeologist [[Luigi Pernier]] in the Minoan palace-site of Phaistos, and features 241 tokens, comprising 45 distinct signs, which were apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic "seals" into a disc of soft clay, in a clockwise sequence spiraling toward the center of the disk.

The Phaistos Disc captured the imagination of amateur and professional archaeologists, and many [[Phaistos Disc decipherment claims|attempts have been made to decipher the code]] behind the disc's signs. While it is not clear that it is a script, most attempted [[decipherment]]s assume that it is; most additionally assume a [[syllabary]], others an [[alphabet]] or [[logography]]. Attempts at decipherment are generally thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs are found, as it is generally agreed that there is not enough context available for a meaningful analysis.

Although the Phaistos Disc is generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists, a few scholars believe that the disc is a [[forgery]] or a [[hoax]].

==Discovery==
[[Image:Table Ph1.png|thumb|250px|Tablet PH-1]]The Phaistos Disc was discovered in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palace-site of [[Phaistos]], near [[Hagia Triada]], on the south coast of [[Crete]];<ref>[http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes C.Michael Hogan, ''Phaistos fieldnotes'', The Modern Antiquarian, 2007]</ref> specifically the disc was found in the basement of room 8 in building 101 of a group of buildings to the northeast of the main palace. This grouping of four rooms also served as a formal entry into the palace complex.  [[Italy|Italian]] archaeologist [[Luigi Pernier]] recovered the intact "dish", about {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and uniformly slightly more than {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=off}} in thickness, on 3 July 1908 during his [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of the first Minoan palace.

It was found in the main cell of an underground "temple depository". These basement cells, only accessible from above, were neatly covered with a layer of fine [[plaster]]. Their content was poor in precious artifacts, but rich in black earth and ashes, mixed with burnt [[bovine]] bones. In the northern part of the main cell, in the same black layer, a few inches south-east of the disc and about {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=off}} above the floor, [[Linear A]] tablet ''PH 1'' was also found. The site apparently collapsed as a result of an [[earthquake]], possibly linked with the  [[Minoan eruption|eruption]] of the [[Santorini]] volcano that affected large parts of the [[Mediterranean region]] during the mid second millennium B.C.

=== Authenticity ===
The Phaistos Disc is generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell-Dunn|first=Graham|title=Who Were the Minoans?|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2006|pages=207|isbn=978-1-4259-2007-4}}</ref> The assumption of authenticity is based on the excavation records by Luigi Pernier. This assumption is supported by the later discovery of the [[Arkalochori Axe]] with similar but not identical glyphs.<ref name="Timm2004" />

The possibility that the disc is a 1908 [[archaeological forgery|forgery]] or hoax has been raised by two scholars.<ref name="Robinson:2008">Robinson:2008</ref><ref name="Eisenberg2008A">{{Cite journal | last = Eisenberg | first = Jerome M. | title = The Phaistos Disk: one hundred year old hoax? | journal = Minerva | issue = July/August | year = 2008 | pages = 9‚Äì24}}</ref><ref name="Eisenberg2008B">{{Cite journal | last = Eisenberg | first = Jerome M. | title = Phaistos Disk: A 100-Year-Old Hoax?

==Dating==
Yves Duhoux (1977) dates the disc to between 1850 B.C. and 1600 B.C. ([[Minoan chronology|MMIII]]) on the basis of Luigi Pernier's report, which says that the Disc was in a  Middle Minoan undisturbed context. Jeppesen (1963) dates it to after 1400 ([[Minoan chronology|LMII-III]]). Doubting the viability of Pernier's report, [[Louis Godart]] (1990) resigns himself to admitting that archaeologically, the disc may be dated to anywhere in Middle or Late Minoan times (MMI-LMIII, a period spanning most of the [[second millennium B.C.]]). J. Best suggests a date in the first half of the fourteenth century B.C. (LMIIIA) based on his dating of tablet PH 1.<ref name="AchterbergSociety2004">{{cite book|author1=Winfried Achterberg|author2=Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society|title=The Phaistos disc: a Luwian letter to Nestor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9hmAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society|isbn=978-90-72067-11-1}}</ref>

== Typography ==
The inscription was apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic "seals" into the soft clay, in a clockwise sequence spiraling toward the center of the disk. It was then fired at high temperature. The unique character of the Phaistos Disc stems from the fact that the entire text was inscribed in this way, reproducing a body of text with reusable characters.

The German typesetter and linguist [[Herbert Brekle]], in his article "The typographic principle" in the ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'', argues that the Phaistos Disc is an early document of [[movable type]] printing, since it meets the essential criterion of [[typographic]] printing, that of type identity:

{{quote|An early clear incidence for the realization of the typographic principle is the notorious Phaistos Disc (ca. 1800‚Äì1600 B.C.). If the disc is, as assumed, a textual representation, we are really dealing with a "printed" text, which fulfills all definitional criteria of the typographic principle. The spiral sequencing of the graphematical units, the fact that they are impressed in a clay disc (blind printing!) and not imprinted are merely possible technological variants of textual representation. The decisive factor is that the material "types" are proven to be repeatedly instantiated on the clay disc.<ref>[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]] (1997): [http://www.typeforum.de/news_332.htm "Das typographische Prinzip. Versuch einer Begriffskl√§rung"], ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'', Vol. 72, pp. 58‚Äì63 (60f.)</ref>}}

As a medieval example for the same technique he goes on to cite the [[Pr√ºfening dedicatory inscription]].<ref>[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]] (1997): [http://www.typeforum.de/news_332.htm "Das typographische Prinzip. Versuch einer Begriffskl√§rung"], ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'', Vol. 72, pp. 58‚Äì63 (62f.)</ref><ref>[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]] (2005): ''Die Pr√ºfeninger Weiheinschrift von 1119.

In his work on decipherment, Benjamin Schwartz also refers to the Phaistos Disc as "the first movable type".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Phaistos disk|first=Benjamin|last=Schwartz|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=18|issue= 2 |year=1959|pages=105‚Äì112 (107)|doi=10.1086/371517}}</ref>

In his popular science book ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] describes the disc as an example of a technological advancement that did not become widespread because it was made at the wrong time in history, and contrasts this with [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s [[printing press]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Society|first=Jared|last=Diamond|chapter=13: Necessity's Mother: The evolution of technology|isbn=978-0-393-03891-0|title-link=Guns, Germs, and Steel|year=1997}}</ref>

===Signs===
There are  242 tokens on the disc, comprising 45 distinct signs. Many of these 45 signs represent easily identifiable everyday things. In addition to these, there is a small diagonal line that occurs underneath the final sign in a group a total of 18 times. The disc shows traces of [[#Corrections|corrections]] made by the scribe in several places. The 45 symbols were numbered by [[Arthur Evans]] from 01 to 45, and this numbering has become the conventional reference used by most researchers. Some symbols have been compared with [[Linear A]] characters by Nahm,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Vergleich von Zeichen des Diskos von Phaistos mit Linear A|first=Werner|last=Nahm|journal=Kadmos|issue= Vol. 14, No. 2. (1975)|pages= 97‚Äì101}}</ref> Timm,<ref name="Timm2004">{{Cite journal|title=Der Diskos von Phaistos - Anmerkungen zur Deutung und Textstruktur|first=Torsten|last=Timm|journal=[[Indogermanische Forschungen]]|year=2004|issue=109|pages= 204‚Äì231|laysummary=http://www.kereti.de/arkalochoriEngl.html}}</ref> and others. Other scholars (J. Best, S. Davis) have pointed to similar resemblances with the [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s, or with [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s  (A. Cuny). In the table below, the character "names" as given by Louis Godart (1995) are given in upper case; where other description or elaboration applies, they are given in lower case.

The nine ''[[hapax]]es'', i.e. occurring just once, are 04 (A5), 05 (B3), 11 (A13), 15 (B8), 17 (A24), 30 (B27), 42 (B9), 43 (B4), 44 (A7). Of the eight twice-occurring symbols, four (03, 21, 28, 41) occur on side A only, three (09, 16, 20) on side B only, and only one (14) on both sides.

===Oblique stroke signs===
There are a number of signs marked with an oblique stroke; the strokes are not imprinted but carved by hand, and are attached to the first or last sign of a "word", depending on the direction of reading chosen. Their meaning is a matter of discussion. One hypothesis, supported by Evans, Duhoux, Ohlenroth and others, is that they were used to subdivide the text into paragraphs, but alternative meanings have been offered by other scholars.

===Directionality===
Evans, at one point, published an assertion that the disc had been written, and should be read, from the center out; because it would have been easiest to place the inscription first and then size the disc to fit the text. There is general agreement that he was wrong, and Evans himself later changed his mind: the inscription was made, and should be read, from the outside in toward the centre. The centres of the spirals are not in the centre of the disc, and some of the symbols near the centre are crowded, as though the maker was cramped for space. One pair of symbols are set top-to-bottom, so it is hard to tell what order they should be in. Except in the cramped section, when there are overstrikes, the inner symbol overlies the outer symbol. Jean Faucounau has proposed a reconstruction of the scribe's movements, which would also require an inward direction; Yves Duhoux says that any outward reading may be discarded. Despite this consensus, there are still a few such attempted decipherments (See [[Phaistos Disc decipherment claims]]).

In addition to the question of the directionality of the text on the disc itself, different viewpoints are held as to how the Phaistos Disc characters should be displayed when transcribed into text. The disc itself probably has right-to-left directionality, if reading proceeds from the outside to the centre; this means that the reading direction is into the faces of the people and animals, as it is in Egyptian and Anatolian. Phaistos Disc characters are shown with left-to-right directionality in this article, with the glyphs mirrored compared to their orientation on the disc; which is also the typical practice for edited Egyptian and Anatolian hieroglyphic text.

===Inscription text===

[[File:Discos Phaitos Umzeichnung.png|thumb|Fields numbering by Louis Godart]]
There are 61 "words", 31 on side A and 30 on side B (numbered A1 to A31 and B1 to B30, outside to inside), here read outside-to-inside (putting the "plumed head" signs word-initially and the strokes word-finally). The shortest words are two symbols in length, the longest seven symbols. The strokes are here transcribed as diagonal strokes (/). The transcription begins at the vertical line of five dots, circling the rim of the disc once, clockwise (13 words on A, 12 words on B) before spiralling toward the center (18 more words on each side). There is one word-final effaced sign at A8, which Godart (1995:101) notes as resembling sign 3 or 20; or less probably 8 or 44. Evans considered side A as the front side, but technical arguments have since been forwarded favouring side B as the front side.

The signs in the transcription below appear in left-to-right orientation, and the reader may read into the faces of the human and animal figures (as one reads Egyptian and Anatolian hieroglyphs):

The "plumed head" (02) only ever occurs word-initially, in 13 instances followed by the "shield" (12, which in some instances also occurs word-finally). Six words occur twice each:
The three-word sequence 02-27-25-10-23-18 28-01/ 02-12-31-26/ occurs twice (A14-16, A20-22). 02-12-31-26/ recurs for a third time (A19). Four more words occur twice each, 02-12-27-27-35-37-21 (A17, A29), 10-03-38 (A28, A31), 22-29-36-07-08/ (B21, B26) and 29-45-07/ (A3, B20).

===Corrections===
As noted [[#Signs|above]], corrections have been made. Signs have been erased and over-printed by other signs.

Godart (1995:99-107) describes these corrections, by word.
They occur in the following words: A1 (signs 02-12-13-01), A4 (29-29-34) together with A5 (02-12-04), A8 (12), A10 (02-41-19?-35), A12 (12), A16 (12-31-26?), A17 (second 27?), A29 (second 27?), B1 (12-22), B3 (37?), B4 (22-25 imprinted over the same), B10 (07?-24?-40?), B13 (beside 29?). Question marks indicate uncertainty about that particular sign being the result of a correction.

Also, the borders of word B28 has been widened to make room for sign 02. See Duhoux (1977:34-35) and Godart (1995:107).

=== Rotations ===

The two signs 27 (Hide) in word A29 are rotated 180 degrees compared with all other occurrences of this sign: "head down" versus "head up". This rotation might be motivated by lack of space in A29; see Duhoux (1977), p.24 (section 6A-8). 

The rotations of the signs 29 (Cat) and 31 (Eagle) have no lack of space. Defining the sign 29 in words B19, B20 and B21 as "head to the right", we have: head down in B29; head to the left in A3 and B15; head up in B18 and B26; head in between up and left in B13; head in between right and down in A4 (twice). The direction of the head of sign 31 is as follows: to the right in A16, up in A9 and A25, and to the left in A22.

The sign 02 (Plumed head) in word A29 is 90 degrees rotated to the right compared with all other occurrences of this sign. This might well be due to lack of space; the word is crowded and messy, with the sign 12 (Shield) pushed aside. 

The two occurrences of sign 28 (Bull's leg) are not rotated compared with each other. Rather, the way this sign is shown in the literature (including Unicode), with the foot down, is rotated compared with the sign on the disc, with the foot up. 

If one assumes the rotations are completely randomly distributed, then the probability that they end up in only two (or three) signs is very small. This suggests that these rotations might be deliberate.<ref>ten Cate, Arie, "A statistical analysis of the rotated signs of the Phaistos Disc", ''Pioneer Journal of Theoretical and Applied Statistics'', Vol 6, Issue 2, pp.81-88 (2013)</ref>

===Signs in adjacent windings===
There are several occurrences on side A where the same sign is at two places near each other in adjacent windings of the spiral. For example, consider the Plumed Head (sign 02) in word A1 and the Plumed Head in word A14. Three patterns of such occurrences have been identified. A computer analysis of one of them (involving most of the Plumed Head signs on side A) has been performed with the conclusion that the probability of this pattern being coincidental is small. The existence of the two other patterns further decreases the probability of coincidence.<ref>ten Cate, Arie, "Patterns on an ancient artifact: a coincidence?", ''Statistica Neerlandica'', Vol 65, pp.116‚Äì124 (2011) {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9574.2010.00478.x}}</ref>

Several occurrences are caused by a [[#Corrections|correction]]. Also, the orientation of the signs seems to be relevant: the two Hides (sign 27) in word A29 are upside down, with the "heads" pointing to the Hide sign in the adjacent winding in word A23.

If this is indeed not coincidental then the inscription is not a one-dimensional text. Of course this does not give us a decipherment; rather it narrows down the potential decipherments.

==Decipherment attempts==
{{further|Phaistos Disc decipherment claims}}

A great deal of speculation developed around the disc during the twentieth century. The Phaistos Disc captured the imagination of amateur archeologists. Many attempts have been made to [[decipherment|decipher]] the code behind the disc's signs. Historically, almost anything has been proposed, including prayers, a narrative or an adventure story, a "[[psaltery|psalterion]]", a call to arms, a [[board game]], and a geometric [[theorem]]. Some of the more fanciful interpretations of its meaning are classic examples of [[pseudoarchaeology]].

Most linguistic interpretations assume a [[syllabary]], based on the proportion of 45 symbols in a text of 241 tokens typical for that type of script; some assume a syllabary with interspersed [[logographic]] symbols, a property of every known syllabary of the [[Ancient Near East]] ([[Linear B]] as well as [[cuneiform]] and [[hieroglyph]]ic writing). There are, however, also alphabetic and purely logographical interpretations.

While enthusiasts still believe the mystery can be solved, scholarly attempts at [[decipherment]] are thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs turn up somewhere, as it is generally thought that there is not enough context available for meaningful analysis. Any decipherment without external confirmation, such as successful comparison to other inscriptions, is unlikely to be accepted as conclusive.

===Origin of the script===

====Cretan or foreign origin?====
There are a few main theories about the origin of the signs. For the first few decades after its discovery most scholars argued strongly against the local origin of the artifact.  Evans (1909:24f.) wrote  that
{{quote|
when one comes to compare the figures in detail with those of the [[Minoan hieroglyphic signary]], very great discrepancy is observable... Out of the forty-five separate signs on the Phaistos Disk, no more than ten more or less resemble Cretan hieroglyphic forms... The human figures in their outline and costume are non-Minoan... The representation of the ship also differs from all similar designs that occur either among the hieroglyphic or the linear documents of Crete.
}}

Glotz (1925:381) claimed that the clay was not from Crete. Ipsen (1929:15) concluded that the Disc was certainly from somewhere on the Aegean. Because of its differences from Linear A or B, Ipsen found it tempting to assume, like Evans, a non-Cretan origin for the Disc. He observes, however, that since Linear A was a common Aegean script such an assumption will not resolve the problem of multiplicity.

The [[Arkalochori Axe]] and other finds have made Cretan origin more popular: female images with pendulous breasts have also been found at Malia and Phaistos. (Godart 1995:125).  Duhoux asserts the Cretan ''provenance'' of the disc; in his review of current research, Trauth (1990:154) concludes that "Crete as [the] source of the Disc can no longer be called into question." [[W. Andrew Robinson|Andrew Robinson]] (2008), in a review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', wrote "Most scholars today, including Duhoux, think it a plausible working hypothesis that the disc was made in Crete."

====Original invention or derivation?====
Ipsen (1929:11) also speaks  against an entirely independent origin of the scripts, arguing that its inventors did not leap from no knowledge of writing to a syllabic script with these elegant signs. He goes on to cite [[Anatolian hieroglyph|Hieroglyphic Luwian]] as a "perfect parallel" (Ipsen 1929:17) of an original script inspired under the direct influence of other scripts (its symbol values inspired by [[cuneiform]], its shapes by [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s)

Schwartz (1956:108) asserts a genetic relationship between the Phaistos Disc script and the Cretan linear scripts.

Among the known scripts, there are three main candidates for being related to the Disc's script, all of them partly syllabic, partly logographic: [[Linear A]], [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s and Egyptian hieroglyphs. More remote possibilities are comparison with the [[Phoenician abjad]] or the [[Byblos syllabary]].

====Linear A====
Some signs are close enough to both [[Linear A]] and [[Linear B]] that they may have the same phonetic values, as [[Image:Phaistos glyph 12.svg|40x30px|12]] 12 = ''qe'', [[Image:Phaistos glyph 43.svg|40x30px|43]] 43 = ''ta''<sub>2</sub>, or [[Image:Phaistos glyph 31.svg|40x30px|31]] 31 = ''ku''. But this opinion is not shared by all specialists of the Aegean Scripts.
A recent systematic comparison with Linear A is that of  Torsten Timm, 2004.<ref name="Timm2004" />  Based on the [[Linear A]] character distribution patterns collected by Facchetti<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Statistical data and morphematic elements in Linear A|first=Giulio M.|last=Facchetti|journal=Kadmos|issue= Vol. 38, No. 2. (1999)}}</ref> Timm concludes that the language of the Disc inscription is the same as the language of Linear A. Timm identifies 20 of the 45 characters with Linear signs, assigning Linear B phonetic values to 16.

====Anatolian hieroglyphs====
Achterberg et al. (2004) present a systematic comparison with [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s, resulting in a full decipherment claim (see below). In particular, they consider the stroke symbol cognate to the [[Luwian language|Luwian]] ''r(a/i)'' symbol, but assign it the value ''-ti''. The stroke on A3 is identified as the personal name determinative. [[Image:Phaistos glyph 01.svg|40x30px|01]] 01 is compared to the [[logogram]] ''SARU'', a walking man or walking legs in Luwian. [[Image:Phaistos glyph 02.svg|40x30px|02]] 02 is compared to word-initial ''a<sub>2</sub>'', a head with a crown in Luwian. The "bow" [[Image:Phaistos glyph 11.svg|40x30px|11]] 11 is identified as the logogram ''sol suus'', the [[winged sun]] known from Luwian royal seals. The "shield" [[Image:Phaistos glyph 12.svg|40x30px|12]] 12 is compared to the near identical Luwian logogram ''TURPI'' "bread" and assigned the value ''tu''.  [[Image:Phaistos glyph 39.svg|40x30px|39]] 39 they read as the "[[thunderbolt]]", logogram of [[Tarhunt]], in Luwian a W-shaped hieroglyph.

=== List of decipherment claims ===
{{main|Phaistos Disc decipherment claims}}

The decipherment claims listed are categorized into linguistic decipherments, identifying the language of the inscription, and non-linguistic decipherments. A purely [[logogram|logographical]] reading is not linguistic in the strict sense: while it may reveal the meaning of the inscription, it will not allow for the identification of the underlying language.

==Unicode==

{{Main|Phaistos Disc (Unicode block)}}

A set of 46 Phaistos Disc characters, comprising 45 signs and one combining oblique stroke, have been encoded in [[Unicode]] since April 2008 (Unicode version 5.1). They are assigned to the range 101D0‚Äì101FF in Plane 1 (the [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]]). Phaistos Disc characters were encoded with strong left-to-right [[Bidirectional algorithm|directionality]], and so in code charts and text (such as elsewhere on this page) the glyphs are mirrored from the way they appear on the disc itself.

==Modern use==
Side A of the Phaistos disc is used as the logo of [[Foundation for Research & Technology ‚Äì Hellas|FORTH]], one of the largest research centers in Greece.
