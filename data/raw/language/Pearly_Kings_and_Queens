The practice of wearing clothes decorated with [[mother-of-pearl]] buttons<ref name=london_campanion/> is first associated with [[Henry Croft (pearly)|Henry Croft]] (1861-1930), an orphan [[street sweeper]] who collected money for charity. At the time, London [[costermonger]]s (street traders) were in the habit of wearing trousers decorated at the seams with pearl buttons that had been found by market traders. In the late 1870s, Croft adapted this to create a pearly suit to draw attention to himself and aid his fund-raising activities.<ref name=association>{{cite web | url=http://www.thepearlies.co.uk/ | title=Original London Pearly Kings and Queens Association | accessdate=2009-09-24 }}</ref><ref name=society>{{cite web | url=http://www.pearlysociety.co.uk/ | title=London Pearly Kings and Queens Society | accessdate=2009-09-24 }}</ref> In 1911 an organised pearly society was formed in [[Finchley]], north London.<ref name=london_campanion/> 

Croft's funeral in January 1930 was attended by 400 followers<ref name=london_campanion/> and received national media coverage.<ref name=pathe_funeral>{{cite web | url= http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=21943 | title=The Passing of the King of Pearly Kings | date=January 9, 1930 | publisher=British Pathe | work=British Pathe Archive | accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> In 1934 a memorial, referring to him as "The original Pearly King", was unveiled in [[St. Pancras and Islington Cemetery|St Pancras Cemetery]], and in a speech to mark the occasion he was said to have raised Â£5,000 for those suffering in London's hospitals.<ref name=pathe_memorial>{{cite web | url= http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=5235 | title=Memorial to "Pearly King" | date=June 4, 1934 | publisher=British Pathe | work=British Pathe Archive | accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref>

==Pearly organisations==
The pearlies are now divided into several active groups. Croft's founding organisation is called the Original London Pearly Kings and Queens Association. It was reformed in 1975<ref name=london_campanion/><ref name=association/> and holds the majority of the [http://thepearlies.co.uk/home/meet-the-pearlies/ original pearly titles] which are [[City of London]], [[Westminster]], Victoria, Hackney, [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], [[Shoreditch]], [[Islington]], Dalston and [[Hoxton]].  Other groups have also been established over the years. The oldest is the Pearly Guild, which began in 1902.<ref name=london_campanion/><ref name=guild>{{ cite web | url=http://www.cockneymuseum.u-net.com/ | title=Pearly Guild | accessdate=2009-09-24 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620132058/http://www.cockneymuseum.u-net.com/ | archivedate=2009-06-20 | df= }}</ref> Modern additions include the London Pearly Kings and Queens Society, which started in 2001<ref name=london_campanion/><ref name=society>{{cite web | url=http://www.pearlysociety.co.uk/ | title=London Pearly Kings and Queens Society | accessdate=2009-09-24 }}</ref> and the Pearly Kings and Queens Guild.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pearlykingsandqueens.com/history/|title=Pearly Kings and Queens Guild|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref> Despite the rivalries, each group is associated with a church in central London and is committed to raising money for London-based charities.<ref name=london_campanion/> A parade of real-life Pearly Kings and Queens was featured at the [[2012 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony]].
