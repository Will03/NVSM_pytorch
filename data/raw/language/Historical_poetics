In [[film studies]], '''historical poetics''' is a scholarly approach to studying [[film]], which [[David Bordwell]] outlined in his book ''Making Meaning'' (1989).<ref name=Bhaskar>Ira Stig Bhaskar (2004), "Historical Poetics, Narrative, and Interpretation" in ''A Companion to Film Theory'' (eds. Toby Miller & Robert Stan). Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, p. 387</ref><ref> Bhaskar's article is a critical account of historical poetics.</ref>

==Overview==
Bordwell argues that theory-driven, interpretative approaches should be eschewed and argued that historical poetics was a better approach to studying film.<ref name=Bhaskar/> Bordwell argues that "[a]ny inquiry into the fundamental principles by which a work in any representational medium is constructed can fall within the domain of poetics."<ref name=Bordwell1>David Bordwell (1989), "Historical Poetics of Cinema" in ''The Cinematic Text'' (ed. R. Barton Palmer). New York: AMS Press, p. 371</ref> Henry Jenkins makes a distinction between [[descriptive poetics]] and prescriptive poetics where the former examine "how artworks ''have been'' constructed" and the latter make a case for "how artworks ''should be'' constructed."<ref name=Jenkins>Henry Jenkins (1989), "Historical Poetics" in ''Approaches to Popular Film'' (ed. Joanne Hollows and Mark Jankovich). Manchester: Manchester UP, p. 100</ref> Much of Bordwell's own research falls within the former category while an example of the latter is the ''[[Dogme 95|Dogme 95 Manifesto]]'' by [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Film director|director]]s [[Lars von Trier]] and [[Thomas Vinterberg]].

Bordwell's research into the stylistic changes in Hollywood cinema demonstrates four specific changes: the use of more rapid editing, an increasingly frequent use of very long or very short lenses, a more prevalent use of close shots, and more camera movement.<ref name=Bordwell3>David Bordwell (2002) “Intensified Continuity: Visual Style in Contemporary American Film” in ''Film Quarterly'' 55(3), 16-28.</ref><ref name=Bordwell2>David Bordwell (2006) ''The Way Hollywood Tells It. Story and Style in Modern Movies'' Berkeley: University of California Press.</ref>

Historical poetics and [[neoformalism (film theory)|neoformalism]]<ref>Historical poetics and neoformalism are sometimes used interchangeably, sometimes as related approaches.</ref> are part of the "post-theory" trend in [[film studies]]. Bordwell has repeatedly argued that some approaches — ones based in "Grand Theories" — do not study films ''per se'' but instead use films to confirm predetermined theoretical frameworks. He and [[Noël Carroll]] coined the term "S.L.A.B. theory" which refers to theorists [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]], [[Lacan]], [[Althusser]], and [[Barthes]].<ref>Annette Kuhn and Guy Westwell (2012).
