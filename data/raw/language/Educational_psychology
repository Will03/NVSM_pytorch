'''Educational psychology''' is the branch of [[psychology]] concerned with the scientific study of human [[learning]]. The study of learning processes, from both [[cognitive]] and [[behavioral]] perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in [[intelligence]], [[cognitive]] development, affect, [[motivation]], self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.<ref name=Snowman>Snowman, Jack (1997). Educational Psychology: What Do We Teach, What Should We Teach?. "Educational Psychology", 9, 151-169</ref>

Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. It is also informed by [[neuroscience]]. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]], [[classroom management]], and student motivation. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks.<ref name=lucas>Lucas, J.L.; Blazek, M.A. & Riley, A.B. (2005). The lack of representation of educational psychology and school psychology in introductory psychology textbooks. ''Educational Psychology'', 25, 347–51.</ref>

The field of educational psychology involves the study of [[memory]], conceptual processes, and individual differences (via cognitive psychology) in conceptualizing new strategies for learning processes in humans. Educational psychology has been built upon theories of [[operant conditioning]], [[Functional psychology|functionalism]], [[structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]], [[constructivism (psychological school)|constructivism]], [[humanistic psychology]], [[Gestalt psychology]], and [[information processing]].<ref name="Snowman"/>

Educational psychology has seen rapid growth and development as a profession in the last twenty years.<ref name=Farrell>Farrell, P. (2010). School psychology: Learning lessons from history and moving forward. School Psychology International, 31(6), 581-598.</ref> [[School psychology]] began with the concept of intelligence testing leading to provisions for special education students, who could not follow the regular classroom curriculum in the early part of the 20th century.<ref name="Farrell"/> However, "school psychology" itself has built a fairly new profession based upon the practices and theories of several psychologists among many different fields. Educational psychologists are working side by side with psychiatrists, social workers, teachers, speech and language therapists, and counselors in attempt to understand the questions being raised when combining behavioral, cognitive, and social psychology in the classroom setting.<ref name="Farrell"/>

==History==

===Early years===
Educational psychology is a fairly new and growing field of study. Though it can date back as early as the days of Plato and Aristotle, it was not identified as a specific practice. It was unknown that everyday teaching and learning in which individuals had to think about individual differences, assessment, development, the nature of a subject being taught, problem solving, and transfer of learning was the beginning to the field of educational psychology. These topics are important to education and as a result it is important to understanding human cognition, learning, and social perception.<ref name="Berliner">{{cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David|title=The 100-Year Journey Of Educational Psychology|url=http://www.wou.edu/~girodm/611/Berliner_100years.pdf}}</ref>

====Plato and Aristotle====

Educational [[psychology]] dates back to the time of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] researched individual differences in the field of [[education]], training of the body and the cultivation of psycho-motor skills, the formation of good character, the possibilities and limits of moral [[education]]. Some other educational topics they spoke about were the effects of music, poetry, and the other arts on the development of individual, role of teacher, and the relations between teacher and student.<ref name="Berliner"/>  Plato saw knowledge as an innate ability, which  evolves through experience and understanding of the world. Such a statement has evolved into a continuing argument of [[nature]] vs. nurture in understanding conditioning and learning today. [[Aristotle]] observed the phenomenon of "association." His four laws of association included succession, contiguity, similarity, and contrast. His studies examined recall and facilitated learning processes.<ref name=Lott>[[Toomas Lott]] (2011). "Plato on the Rationality of Belief, Trames", 15, 339-364.</ref>

====John Locke====

[[John Locke]] was considered one of the most influential philosophers in post-renaissance Europe in about mid 1600s. Locke was called "Father of English Psychology". One of Locke's most important works was written in 1690, named ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. In this essay, he introduced the term "tabula rasa" meaning "blank slate." Locke explained that learning was primarily understood through experience only, and we were all born without knowledge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.niu.edu/acad/psych/Millis/History/2003/locke.htm}}</ref>

He followed by contrasting Plato's theory of innate learning processes. Locke believed the mind was formed by experiences, not innate ideas. Locke introduced this idea as "empiricism," or the understanding that knowledge is only built on knowledge and experience.

In the late 1600s, John Locke advanced the hypothesis that people learn primarily from external forces.  He believed that the mind was like a blank tablet (tabula rasa), and that successions of simple impressions give rise to complex ideas through association and reflection.  Locke is credited with establishing "[[empiricism]]" as a criterion for testing the validity of knowledge, thus providing a conceptual framework for later development of experimental methodology in the natural and social sciences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/history.html|title=The History of Educational Psychology|last=|first=|date=|website=cortland.edu|publisher=|access-date=May 5, 2016}}</ref>

===Before 1890===
Philosophers of education such as Juan Vives, Johann Pestalozzi, Friedrich Fröbel, and Johann Herbart had examined, classified and judged the methods of education centuries before the beginnings of psychology in the late 1800s.

====Juan Vives====

[[Juan Vives]] (1493–1540) proposed induction as the method of study and believed in the direct [[observation]] and investigation of the study of [[nature]]. His studies focus of humanistic [[learning]], which opposed scholasticism and was influenced by a variety of sources including [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[religion]], and [[history]].<ref name=zimmerman2>[[Barry Zimmerman|Zimmerman, B.J.]] & [[Dale Schunk|Schunk, D.H.]] (Eds.) (2003). ''Educational psychology: A century of contributions''. Mahwah, NJ, US: Erlbaum.</ref> He was one of the first to emphasize that the location of the school is important to [[learning]].<ref name=vives>Vives, J, & Watson, F. (1913). On education : a translation of the de tradendis disciplinis of juan luis vives . Cambridge : The University Press.</ref> He suggested that the school should be located away from disturbing noises; the air quality should be good and there should be plenty of food for the students and teachers.<ref name="vives"/> Vives emphasized the importance of understanding individual differences of the students and suggested practice as an important tool for learning.<ref name="vives"/>

Vives introduced his educational ideas in his writing, "De anima et vita" in 1538. In this publication, Vives explores moral [[philosophy]] as a setting for his educational ideals; with this, he explains that the different parts of the soul (similar to that of Aristotle's ideas) are each responsible for different operations, which function distinctively. The first book covers the different "souls": "The Vegatative Soul;" this is the soul of [[nutrition]], growth, and reproduction, "The Sensitive Soul," which involves the five external senses; "The Cogitative soul," which includes internal senses and [[cognitive]] facilities. The second book involves functions of the rational soul: mind, will, and memory. Lastly, the third book explains the analysis of emotions.<ref name=Casini>[[Casini, Lorenzo]] (2010). "Quid sit anima": Juan Luis Vives on the soul and its relation to the body". Renaissance Studies, 24, 496- 517</ref>

====Johann Pestalozzi====

[[Johann Pestalozzi]] (1746–1827), a Swiss educational reformer, emphasized the child rather than the content of the school.<ref name=glover>Glover, J, & Ronning, R. (Ed.). (1987).</ref> Pestalozzi fostered an educational reform backed by the idea that early education was crucial for children, and could be manageable for mothers. Eventually, this experience with early education would lead to a "wholesome person characterized by morality."<ref name=Horlacher>Horlacher, Rebekka (2011). Schooling as a means of popular education: Pestalozzi's method as a popular education experiment. "Paedagogica Historica": 47, 65-75</ref> Pestalozzi has been acknowledged for opening institutions for education, writing books for mother's teaching home education, and elementary books for students, mostly focusing on the kindergarten level. In his later years, he published teaching manuals and methods of teaching.<ref name=Horlacher/>

During the time of [[The Enlightenment]], Pestalozzi's ideals introduced "educationalisation." This created the bridge between social issues and education by introducing the idea of social issues to be solved through education. Horlacher describes the most prominent example of this during The Enlightenment to be "improving agricultural production methods."<ref name=Horlacher/>

====Johann Herbart====

Johann Herbart (1776–1841) is considered the father of educational [[psychology]].<ref name=hergenhahn>Hergenhahn, B.R. (2009). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</ref>  He believed that [[learning]] was influenced by interest in the subject and the teacher.<ref name="hergenhahn"/> He thought that teachers should consider the students' existing mental sets—what they already know—when presenting new information or material.<ref name="hergenhahn"/> Herbart came up with what are now known as the formal steps. The 5 steps that teachers should use are:

# Review material that has already been learned by the student<ref name="hergenhahn"/>
# Prepare the student for new material by giving them an overview of what they are learning next<ref name="hergenhahn"/>
# Present the new material.<ref name="hergenhahn"/>
# Relate the new material to the old material that has already been learned.<ref name="hergenhahn"/>
# Show how the student can apply the new material and show the material they will learn next.<ref name="hergenhahn"/>

===1890–1920===
There were three major figures in educational psychology in this period: William James, G. Stanley Hall, and John Dewey. These three men distinguished themselves in general psychology and educational psychology, which overlapped significantly at the end of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David|title=The 100- Year Journey of Educational Psychology|url=http://www.wou.edu/~girodm/611/Berliner_100years.pdf}}</ref> 

====William James (1842–1910)====

[[File:William James, philosopher.jpg|thumb|upright|William James]]
The period of 1890–1920 is considered the golden era of educational psychology where aspirations of the new discipline rested on the application of the scientific methods of observation and experimentation to educational problems. From 1840 to 1920 37 million people immigrated to the United States.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> This created an expansion of elementary schools and secondary schools. The increase in immigration also provided educational psychologists the opportunity to use intelligence testing to screen immigrants at Ellis Island.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> [[Darwinism]] influenced the beliefs of the prominent educational psychologists.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> Even in the earliest years of the discipline, educational psychologists recognized the limitations of this new approach. The pioneering American psychologist [[William James]] commented that: 
{{quote|Psychology is a science, and teaching is an art; and sciences never generate arts directly out of themselves. An intermediate inventive mind must make that application, by using its originality".<ref name=james>[[William James|James, W.]] (1983). ''Talks to teachers on psychology and to students on some of life's ideals''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. (Original work published 1899)</ref>}}
James is the father of psychology in America but he also made contributions to educational psychology.  In his famous series of lectures ''Talks to Teachers on Psychology'', published in 1899, James defines education as "the organization of acquired habits of conduct and tendencies to behavior".<ref name="james"/>  He states that teachers should "train the pupil to behavior"<ref name="james"/> so that he fits into the social and physical world. Teachers should also realize the importance of habit and instinct. They should present information that is clear and interesting and relate this new information and material to things the student already knows about.<ref name="james"/> He also addresses important issues such as attention, memory, and association of ideas.

====Alfred Binet====

[[Alfred Binet]] published ''Mental Fatigue'' in 1898, in which he attempted to apply the experimental method to educational psychology.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>  In this experimental method he advocated for two types of experiments, experiments done in the lab and experiments done in the classroom.  In 1904 he was appointed the Minister of Public Education.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> This is when he began to look for a way to distinguish children with developmental disabilities.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> Binet strongly supported special education programs because he believed that "abnormality" could be cured.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>  The Binet-Simon test was the first intelligence test and was the first to distinguish between  "normal children" and those with developmental disabilities.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>  Binet believed that it was important to study individual differences between age groups and children of the same age.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> He also believed that it was important for teachers to take into account individual students strengths and also the needs of the classroom as a whole when teaching and creating a good learning environment.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> He also believed that it was important to train teachers in observation so that they would be able to see individual differences among children and adjust the curriculum to the students.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> Binet also emphasized that practice of material was important.  In 1916 [[Lewis Terman]] revised the Binet-Simon so that the average score was always 100.<ref name="hergenhahn"/> The test became known as the Stanford-Binet and was one of the most widely used tests of intelligence.  Terman, unlike Binet, was interested in using intelligence test to identify gifted children who had high intelligence.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> In his longitudinal study of gifted children, who became known as the Termites, Terman found that gifted children become gifted adults.<ref name="hergenhahn"/>

====Edward Thorndike====

[[Edward Thorndike]] (1874–1949) supported the scientific movement in education. He based teaching practices on empirical evidence and measurement.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> Thorndike developed the theory of [[instrumental conditioning]] or the law of effect.   The law of effect states that associations are strengthened when it is followed by something pleasing and associations are weakened when followed by something not pleasing. He also found that [[learning]] is done a little at a time or in increments, [[learning]] is an automatic process and all the principles of [[learning]] apply to all mammals. Thorndike's research with [[Robert Woodworth]] on the theory of transfer found that learning one subject will only influence your ability to [[learn]] another subject if the subjects are similar.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> This discovery led to less emphasis on learning the [[classics]] because they found that studying the classics does not contribute to overall general intelligence.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> Thorndike was one of the first to say that individual differences in [[cognitive]] tasks were due to how many stimulus response patterns a person had rather than a general intellectual ability.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>  He contributed word dictionaries that were [[scientifically]] based to determine the words and definitions used.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> The dictionaries were the first to take into consideration the users maturity level.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>  He also integrated pictures and easier pronunciation guide into each of the definitions.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> Thorndike contributed [[arithmetic]] books based on [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]]. He made all the problems more realistic and relevant to what was being studied, not just to improve the general [[intelligence]].<ref name="zimmerman2"/> He developed tests that were standardized to measure performance in school related subjects.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> His biggest contribution to testing was the CAVD intelligence test which used a multidimensional approach to intelligence and the first to use a ratio scale.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> His later work was on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning:
{{quote|If, by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity, a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible, and so on, much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print.<ref name=thorndike>[[Edward Thorndike|Thorndike, E.L.]] (1912). ''Education: A first book''. New York: MacMillan.</ref>}}

====John Dewey====

[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952) had a major influence on the development of [[progressive education]] in the United States. He believed that the classroom should prepare children to be good citizens and facilitate creative intelligence.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> He pushed for the creation of practical classes that could be applied outside of a school setting.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> He also thought that education should be student-oriented, not subject-oriented. For Dewey, education was a social experience that helped bring together generations of people. He stated that students learn by doing. He believed in an active mind that was able to be educated through observation, problem solving and enquiry. In his 1910 book ''How We Think'', he emphasizes that material should be provided in a way that is stimulating and interesting to the student since it encourages original thought and problem solving.<ref name=Dewey>Dewey J. (1910). How we think. New York  D.C. Heath & Co.</ref>  He also stated that material should be relative to the student's own experience.<ref name="Dewey"/>
{{quote|"The material furnished by way of information should be relevant to a question that is vital in the students own experience"<ref name="Dewey"/>}}

====Jean Piaget====

[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) was one of the most powerful researchers in the area of developmental psychology during the 20th century. He developed the theory of [[cognitive]] development.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> The [[theory]] stated that intelligence developed in four different stages. The stages are the sensorimotor stage from birth to 2 years old, the preoperational state from 2 years old to 7 years old, the concrete operational stage from 7 years old to 10 years old, and formal operational stage from 11 years old and up.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> He also believed that learning was constrained to the child's cognitive development. Piaget influenced educational psychology because he was the first to believe that cognitive development was important and something that should be paid attention to in education.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>  Most of the research on Piagetian theory was carried out by American educational psychologists.

===1920–present===
The number of people receiving a high school and college education increased dramatically from 1920 to 1960.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> Because very few jobs were available to teens coming out of eighth grade, there was an increase in high school attendance in the 1930s.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> The progressive movement in the United States took off at this time and led to the idea of [[progressive education]]. John Flanagan, an educational psychologist, developed tests for combat trainees and instructions in combat training.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>  In 1954 the work of Kenneth Clark and his wife on the effects of segregation on black and white children was influential in the Supreme Court case [[Brown v. Board of Education]].<ref name="hergenhahn"/> From the 1960s to present day, educational psychology has switched from a behaviorist perspective to a more cognitive based perspective because of the influence and development of [[cognitive psychology]] at this time.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>

====Jerome Bruner====

[[Jerome Bruner]] is notable for integrating [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s [[cognitive]] approaches into educational [[psychology]].<ref name="zimmerman2"/> He advocated for [[discovery learning]] where teachers create a [[problem solving]] environment that allows the student to question, [[explore]] and experiment.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> In his book ''The Process of Education'' Bruner stated that the structure of the material and the [[cognitive]] abilities of the person are important in [[learning]].<ref name="zimmerman2"/> He emphasized the importance of the subject matter. He also believed that how the subject was structured was important for the student's understanding of the subject and it is the goal of the teacher to structure the subject in a way that was easy for the student to understand.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>  In the early 1960s Bruner went to [[Africa]] to teach math and science to school children, which influenced his view as schooling as a [[cultural]] institution.  Bruner was also influential in the development of MACOS, Man a Course of Study, which was an educational program that combined [[anthropology]] and [[science]].<ref name="zimmerman2"/> The program explored human evolution and social behavior.  He also helped with the development of the head start program. He was interested in the influence of culture on education and looked at the impact of poverty on educational development.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>

====Benjamin Bloom====

[[Benjamin Bloom]] (1903–1999) spent over 50 years at the [[University of Chicago]], where he worked in the department of education.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> He believed that all students can learn. He developed [[taxonomy of educational objectives]].<ref name="zimmerman2"/> The objectives were divided into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive domain deals with how we think.<ref name=clark>Clark, D. (n.d.). Bloom's taxonomy of learning domains. Retrieved from http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html</ref> It is divided into categories that are on a continuum from easiest to more complex.<ref name="clark"/> The categories are knowledge or recall, comprehension application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.<ref name="clark"/>  The affective domain deals with emotions and has 5 categories.<ref name="clark"/> The categories are receiving phenomenon, responding to that phenomenon, valuing, organization, and internalizing values.<ref name="clark"/> The psychomotor domain deals with the development of motor skills, movement and coordination and has 7 categories, that also goes from simplest to complex.<ref name="clark"/> The 7 categories of the psychomotor domain are perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination.<ref name="clark"/> The taxonomy provided broad educational objectives that could be used to help expand the curriculum to match the ideas in the taxonomy.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>  The taxonomy is considered to have a greater influence internationally than in the United States. Internationally, the taxonomy is used in every aspect of education from training of the teachers to the development of testing material.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> Bloom believed in communicating clear learning goals and promoting an active student. He thought that teachers should provide feedback to the students on their strengths and weaknesses.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> Bloom also did research on college students and their problem solving processes. He found that they differ in understanding the basis of the problem and the ideas in the problem. He also found that students differ in process of problem solving in their approach and attitude toward the problem.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>

====Nathaniel Gage====

[[Nathaniel Gage]] (1917 -2008) is an important figure in educational psychology as his research focused on improving teaching and understanding the processes involved in teaching.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> He edited the book ''Handbook of Research on Teaching'' (1963), which helped develop early research in teaching and educational psychology.<ref name="zimmerman2"/> Gage founded the Stanford Center for Research and Development in Teaching, which contributed research on teaching as well as influencing the education of important educational psychologists.<ref name="zimmerman2"/>

==Perspectives==

===Behavioral===
[[Applied behavior analysis]], a research-based science utilizing behavioral principles of [[operant conditioning]], is effective in a range of educational settings.<ref name=Alberto>Alberto, P. & Troutman, A. (2003) ''Applied behavior analysis for teachers'' (6th ed.). Columbus, OH, USA: Prentice-Hall-Merrill.</ref> For example, teachers can alter student behavior by systematically rewarding students who follow classroom rules with praise, stars, or tokens exchangeable for sundry items.<ref name=mcgoey>McGoey, K.E. & DuPaul, G.J. (2000) Token reinforcement and response cost procedures: Reducing the disruptive behavior of preschool children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

(2001) Randomization of group contingencies and reinforcers to reduce classroom disruptive behavior. ''Journal of School Psychology'', 39, 267–77.</ref> Despite the demonstrated efficacy of awards in changing behavior, their use in education has been criticized by proponents of [[self-determination theory]], who claim that praise and other rewards undermine [[intrinsic motivation]]. There is evidence that tangible rewards decrease intrinsic motivation in specific situations, such as when the student already has a high level of intrinsic motivation to perform the goal behavior.<ref name=lepper>[[Mark Lepper|Lepper, M. R.]]; Greene, D. & [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett, R.E.]] (1973). Undermining children's intrinsic interest with extrinsic reward: A test of the "overjustification" hypothesis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 28, 129–37.</ref> But the results showing detrimental effects are counterbalanced by evidence that, in other situations, such as when rewards are given for attaining a gradually increasing standard of performance, rewards enhance intrinsic motivation.<ref name=cameron>Cameron, J.; Pierce, W.D.; Banko, K.M. & Gear, A. (2005). Achievement-based rewards and intrinsic motivation: A test of cognitive mediators. ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 97, 641–55.</ref><ref>Pierce, W.D. & Cameron, J. (2002). A summary of the effects of reward contingencies on interest and performance. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3, 222–26. [http://www.baojournal.com ABO]</ref> Many effective therapies have been based on the principles of applied behavior analysis, including [[pivotal response therapy]] which is used to treat autism spectrum disorders.

===Cognitive===
Among current educational psychologists, the cognitive perspective is more widely held than the behavioral perspective, perhaps because it admits causally related mental constructs such as [[trait theory|traits]], [[beliefs]], [[memories]], [[motivation]]s and [[emotion]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Cognitive theories claim that memory structures determine how information is [[perceive]]d, [[information processing|processed]], stored, [[information retrieval|retrieved]] and [[forgot]]ten. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive psychologists are separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by [[Allan Paivio]]'s [[dual coding theory]]. Educational psychologists have used dual coding theory and [[cognitive load]] theory to explain how people learn from [[multimedia]] presentations.<ref name=Mayer>[[Richard E. Mayer|Mayer, R.E.]] (2001). ''Multimedia learning''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref>

[[Image:KrugDavisGlover1990.png|right|thumb|Three experiments reported by Krug, Davis and Glover<ref name=krug>Krug, D.; Davis, T.B.; Glover, J.A. (1990). Massed versus distributed repeated reading: A case of forgetting helping recall? ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 82, 366–71.</ref> demonstrated the advantage of delaying a 2nd reading of a text passage by one week (distributed) compared with no delay between readings (massed).]]
The spaced learning effect, a [[cognitive]] phenomenon strongly supported by psychological research, has broad applicability within [[education]].<ref name=dempster>Dempster, F.N. (1989). Spacing effects and their implications for theory and practice. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 1, 309–30.</ref> For example, students have been found to perform better on a test of knowledge about a text passage when a second reading of the passage is delayed rather than immediate (see figure).<ref name=krug/> Educational psychology research has confirmed the applicability to education of other findings from cognitive psychology, such as the benefits of using [[mnemonics]] for immediate and delayed retention of information.<ref name=carney>Carney, R.N. & Levin, J.R. (2000). Fading mnemonic memories: Here's looking anew, again!  ''[[Contemporary Educational Psychology]]'', 25, 499–508.</ref>

[[Problem solving]], according to prominent cognitive psychologists, is fundamental to [[learning]]. It resides as an important research topic in educational psychology. A student is thought to interpret a problem by assigning it to a [[schema (psychology)|schema]] retrieved from long-term memory. A problem students run into while reading is called "activation." This is when the student's representations of the text are present during working memory. This causes the student to read through the material without absorbing the information and being able to retain it. When working memory is absent from the reader's representations of the working memory they experience something called "deactivation." When deactivation occurs, the student has an understanding of the material and is able to retain information. If deactivation occurs during the first reading, the reader does not need to undergo deactivation in the second reading. The reader will only need to reread to get a "gist" of the text to spark their [[memory]]. When the problem is assigned to the wrong schema, the student's attention is subsequently directed away from features of the problem that are inconsistent with the assigned schema.<ref name=kalyuga>Kalyuga, S.; Chandler, P.; Tuovinen, J. & [[John Sweller|Sweller, J.]] (2001). When problem solving is superior to studying worked examples. ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 93, 579–88.</ref> The critical step of finding a mapping between the problem and a pre-existing schema is often cited as supporting the centrality of [[analogical]] thinking to problem solving.

====Cognitive view of intelligence====
[[File:Figural Relationships.svg|right|thumb|An example of an item from a cognitive abilities test]]
Each person has an individual profile of characteristics, abilities and challenges that result from predisposition, learning and development. These manifest as individual differences in [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], [[creativity]], [[cognitive style]], [[motivation]] and the capacity to process information, communicate, and relate to others. The most prevalent disabilities found among school age children are [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[learning disability]], [[dyslexia]], and [[speech disorder]]. Less common disabilities include [[intellectual disability]], [[hearing impairment]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[epilepsy]], and [[blindness]].<ref name=woolfolk/>

Although theories of [[intelligence]] have been discussed by philosophers since [[Plato]], intelligence testing is an invention of educational psychology, and is coincident with the development of that discipline. Continuing debates about the nature of intelligence revolve on whether [[intelligence]] can be characterized by a single [[factor analysis|factor]] known as [[general intelligence factor|general intelligence]],<ref name=spearman1904>Spearman, C. (1904) "General intelligence" objectively determined and measured. ''American Journal of Psychology'', 15, 201–93.</ref> multiple factors (e.g., [[Howard Gardner|Gardner's]] [[theory of multiple intelligences]]<ref>Gardner, Howard. (1983) ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''. New York: Basic Books.</ref>), or whether it can be measured at all. In practice, standardized instruments such as the [[Stanford-Binet IQ test]] and the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]]<ref>Wechsler, D. (1949). ''The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.'' New York: Psychological Corp.</ref> are widely used in economically developed countries to identify children in need of individualized educational treatment. Children classified as [[gifted]] are often provided with accelerated or enriched programs. Children with identified deficits may be provided with enhanced education in specific skills such as [[phonological awareness]]. In addition to basic abilities, the individual's personality [[trait theory|traits]] are also important, with people higher in [[conscientiousness]] and [[hope]] attaining superior academic achievements, even after controlling for intelligence and past performance.<ref>Day, L.; Hanson, K.; Maltby, J.; Proctor, C.L. & Wood, A.M. (in press).

===Developmental===
{{Main|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}
Developmental psychology, and especially the psychology of cognitive development, opens a special perspective for educational psychology. This is so because education and the psychology of cognitive development converge on a number of crucial assumptions. First, the psychology of cognitive development defines human cognitive competence at successive phases of development. Education aims to help students acquire knowledge and develop skills which are compatible with their understanding and problem-solving capabilities at different ages. Thus, knowing the students' level on a developmental sequence provides information on the kind and level of knowledge they can assimilate, which, in turn, can be used as a frame for organizing the subject matter to be taught at different school grades. This is the reason why [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]] was so influential for education, especially mathematics and science education.<ref>Furth, H.G. & Wachs, H. (1975). ''Thinking goes to school: Piaget's theory in practice''. Oxford: Oxford University Press</ref> In the same direction, the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] suggest that in addition to the concerns above, sequencing of concepts and skills in teaching must take account of the processing and [[working memory]] capacities that characterize successive age levels.<ref>Demetriou, A. & Valanides, N. (1998). A three level of theory of the developing mind: Basic principles and implications for instruction and assessment. In R.J. Sternberg & W.M. Williams (Eds.), ''Intelligence, instruction, and assessment'' (pp. 149–99). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.</ref><ref name="Demetriou, A. 2010">Demetriou, A.; Spanoudis, G. & Mouyi, A. (2010). A Three-level Model of the Developing Mind: Functional and Neuronal Substantiation. In M. Ferrari and L. Vuletic (Eds.), ''The Developmental Relations between Mind, Brain, and Education: Essays in honor of Robbie Case''. New York: Springer.</ref>
   
Second, the psychology of [[cognitive development]] involves understanding how [[cognitive]] change takes place and recognizing the factors and processes which enable cognitive competence to develop. [[Education]] also capitalizes on [[cognitive]] change, because the construction of knowledge presupposes effective teaching methods that would move the student from a lower to a higher level of understanding. Mechanisms such as reflection on actual or [[Mind|mental]] actions vis-à-vis alternative solutions to problems, tagging new concepts or solutions to symbols that help one recall and mentally manipulate them are just a few examples of how mechanisms of cognitive development may be used to facilitate learning.<ref name="Demetriou, A. 2010"/><ref>Case, R. (1985). ''Intellectual development: Birth to adulthood.'' New York: Academic Press.</ref>

Finally, the psychology of cognitive development is concerned with individual differences in the organization of cognitive processes and abilities, in their rate of change, and in their mechanisms of change. The principles underlying intra- and inter-individual differences could be educationally useful, because knowing how students differ in regard to the various dimensions of cognitive development, such as processing and representational capacity, self-understanding and self-regulation, and the various domains of understanding, such as mathematical, scientific, or verbal abilities, would enable the teacher to cater for the needs of the different students so that no one is left behind.<ref name="Demetriou, A. 2010"/><ref>Case, R. (1992). The role of central conceptual structures in the development of children's mathematical and scientific thought. In A. Demetriou, M. Shayer, & A. Efklides (Eds.), ''Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development: Implications and applications to education'' (pp. 52–65). London: Routledge.</ref>

===Constructivist===
{{Main|Constructivism (learning theory)|l1=Constructivism}}
Constructivism is a category of learning theory in which emphasis is placed on the agency and prior "knowing" and experience of the learner, and often on the social and cultural determinants of the learning process. Educational psychologists distinguish individual (or psychological) constructivism, identified with [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]], from [[social constructivism (learning theory)|social constructivism]]. A dominant influence on the latter type is [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s work on sociocultural learning, describing how interactions with adults, more capable peers, and cognitive tools are internalized to form mental constructs. Elaborating on Vygotsky's theory, [[Jerome Bruner]] and other educational psychologists developed the important concept of [[instructional scaffolding]], in which the social or information environment offers supports for learning that are gradually withdrawn as they become internalized.<ref name="educational psychology">Seifert, Kelvin & Sutton, Rosemary. ''[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Educational-Psychology.pdf Educational Psychology: Second Edition]''. Global Text Project, 2009, pp.&nbsp;33–37.</ref>

==== Jean Piaget's Cognitive Development ====
Jean Piaget was interested in how an organism adapts to its environment. Piaget hypothesized that infants are born with a schema operating at birth that he called "reflexes". Piaget  identified four stages in cognitive development. The four stages are sensorimotor stage, pre-operational stage, concrete operational stage and formal operational stage.<ref name=Huitt>{{cite journal|last1=Huitt|first1=W|last2=Hummel |first2=J|title=Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development|journal=Educational Psychology Interactive|year=2003|url=http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/cognition/piaget.html}}</ref>

==Conditioning and learning==

[[Image:Kugleramme.jpg|thumb|left|An [[abacus]] provides concrete experiences for learning abstract concepts.]]
To understand the characteristics of learners in [[child]]hood, [[adolescence]], [[adulthood]], and [[old age]], educational psychology develops and applies theories of human [[developmental psychology|development]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/action/science/teaching-learning/index.aspx|title=Educational Psychology Promotes Teaching and Learning|website=apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref> Often represented as stages through which people pass as they mature, developmental theories describe changes in mental abilities ([[cognition]]), social roles, moral reasoning, and beliefs about the nature of knowledge.

For example, educational psychologists have conducted research on the instructional applicability of [[cognitive development|Jean Piaget's theory of development]], according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children need to be taught using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur at the same time in all domains. A child may be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.<ref name=woolfolk>Woolfolk, A.E.; Winne, P.H. & Perry, N.E. (2006). ''Educational Psychology'' (3rd Canadian ed.). Toronto, Canada: Pearson.</ref>

Piaget proposed a developmental theory of [[moral reasoning]] in which children progress from a naïve understanding of [[morality]] based on behavior and outcomes to a more advanced understanding based on intentions. Piaget's views of moral development were elaborated by [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] into a [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stage theory of moral development]]. There is evidence that the moral reasoning described in stage theories is not sufficient to account for moral behavior. For example, other factors such as [[modeling (psychology)|modeling]] (as described by the [[social cognitive theory of morality]]) are required to explain [[bullying]].

[[Rudolf Steiner]]'s model of [[child development]] interrelates physical, emotional, cognitive, and moral development<ref name="uwe.ac.uk RR645 1.5 Findings">Woods, Ashley and Woods, [http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR645.pdf ''Steiner Schools in England'', University of West of England, Bristol: Research Report RR645], section 1.5, "Findings from the survey and case studies"</ref> in developmental stages similar to those later described by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]].<ref>Carrie Y. Nordlund, "Art Experiences in Waldorf Education," Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Missouri-Columbia, May 2006</ref>

Developmental theories are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of [[epistemological]] beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) have been described in terms of gradual changes in people's belief in: certainty and permanence of knowledge, fixedness of ability, and credibility of authorities such as teachers and experts. People develop more sophisticated beliefs about knowledge as they gain in education and maturity.<ref name=cano>Cano, F. (2005). Epistemological beliefs and approaches to learning: Their change through secondary school and their influence on academic performance. ''British Journal of Educational Psychology'', 75, 203–21.</ref>

===Motivation===
[[Motivation]] is an internal state that activates, guides and sustains behavior. Motivation can have several impacting effects on how students learn and how they behave towards subject matter:<ref>{{cite web|last=Omrod|first=Jeanne|title=Educational Theme: Motivation in the Classroom|url=http://www.greeneeducationfoundation.org/documents/GEF_2012-2013_Educational_Theme.pdf|publisher=Green Education Foundation}}</ref> 
* Provide direction towards goals
* Enhance cognitive processing abilities and performance
* Direct behavior toward particular goals
* Lead to increased effort and energy
* Increase initiation of and persistence in activities

Educational psychology research on motivation is concerned with the [[volition (psychology)|volition]] or [[will (philosophy)|will]] that students bring to a task, their level of interest and [[intrinsic motivation]], the personally held [[goal setting|goals]] that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As intrinsic motivation deals with activities that act as their own rewards, extrinsic motivation deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of [[attribution theory]] developed by [[Bernard Weiner]]<ref name=weiner>[[Bernard Weiner|Weiner, B.]] (2000). Interpersonal and intrapersonal theories of motivation from an attributional perspective. ''Educational Psychology Review'', 12, 1–14.</ref> describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of [[shame]] and [[embarrassment]] and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.<ref name="weiner"/>

The [[self-determination theory]] (SDT) was developed by psychologists [[Edward L. Deci|Edward Deci]] and Richard Ryan. SDT focuses on the importance of [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic and extrinsic motivation]] in driving human behavior and posits inherent growth and development tendencies. It emphasizes the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined. When applied to the realm of education, the self-determination theory is concerned primarily with promoting in students an interest in learning, a value of education, and a confidence in their own capacities and attributes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Deci|first=Edward L.|title=Motivation and Education: The Self-Determination Perspective|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=1991|volume=26|issue=3 & 4|pages=325–346|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2603&4_6}}</ref>

Motivational theories also explain how [[goal theory|learners' goals]] affect the way they engage with academic tasks.<ref name=elliot>Elliot, A.J. (1999). Approach and avoidance motivation and achievement goals. ''Educational Psychologist'', 34, 169–89.</ref> Those who have ''mastery goals'' strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have ''performance approach goals'' strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have ''performance avoidance'' goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence in the face of failure, preference for challenging tasks, [[creativity]] and [[intrinsic motivation]]. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor [[attention|concentration]] while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and [[Anxiety (mood)#Test and performance|test anxiety]]. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.<ref name="elliot"/>

[[Locus of control]] is a salient factor in the successful academic performance of students. During the 1970s and '80s, [[Cassandra B. Whyte]] did significant educational research studying locus of control as related to the academic achievement of students pursuing higher education coursework. Much of her educational research and publications focused upon the theories of [[Julian B. Rotter]] in regard to the importance of internal control and successful academic performance.<ref name="Whyte80">Whyte, C. (1980). An Integrated Counseling and Learning Assistance Center. New Directions Sourcebook. Jossey-Bass, Inc. San Francisco.</ref> Whyte reported that individuals who perceive and believe that their hard work may lead to more successful academic outcomes, instead of depending on luck or fate, persist and achieve academically at a higher level. Therefore, it is important to provide education and counseling in this regard.<ref>Whyte, C. (1978). Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen. ''Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance'', 6 (4), 198–200.</ref>

==Technology==
{{broader|Educational technology}}
[[Image:BloomsCognitiveDomain.svg|right|thumb|[[Taxonomy of educational objectives|Bloom's taxonomy]] of educational objectives: categories in the cognitive domain<ref name=Anderson>Anderson, L.W. & [[David Krathwohl|Krathwohl, D.R.]] (2001). ''A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing: A revision of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives''. New York, USA: Addison-Wesley Longman.</ref>]]
[[Instructional design]], the systematic design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a [[taxonomy of educational objectives]] created by [[Benjamin Bloom]] and colleagues.<ref name=Anderson/> Bloom also researched [[mastery learning]], an instructional strategy in which learners only advance to a new learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom<ref name=Bloom>[[Benjamin Bloom|Bloom, B.S.]] (1984). The two sigma problem: The search for methods of group instruction as effective as one-to-one tutoring. ''Educational Researcher'', 13 (6), 4–16.</ref> discovered that a combination of mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction. [[Robert M. Gagné|Gagné]], another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of [[task analysis]] in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives<ref name=gronlund>Gronlund, N.E. (2000). ''How to write and use instructional objectives'' (6th ed.). Columbus, OH, USA: Merrill.</ref> connected by prerequisite relationships.
The following list of technological resources incorporate computer-aided instruction and intelligence for educational psychologists and their students: 
* [[Intelligent tutoring system]]
* [[Cognitive tutor]]
* [[Cooperative learning]]
* [[Collaborative learning]]
* [[Problem-based learning]]
* [[Computer-supported collaborative learning]]
* [[Constructive alignment]]

Technology is essential to the field of educational psychology, not only for the psychologist themselves as far as testing, organization, and resources, but also for students. Educational Psychologists whom reside in the K- 12 setting focus the majority of their time with Special Education students. It has been found that students with disabilities learning through technology such as IPad applications and videos are more engaged and motivated to learn in the classroom setting. Liu et al. explain that learning-based technology allows for students to be more focused, and learning is more efficient with learning technologies. The authors explain that learning technology also allows for students with social- emotional disabilities to participate in distance learning.<ref name=Liu>Liu, Gi Zen; Wu, No- Wei; Chen, Ye- Wen. Identifying Emerging Trends for implementing learning technology in special education. "Research in Development disabilities", 2013, 3618–3628</ref>

==Applications==

===Teaching===

[[Image:FinnGerberBoydZaharias2005.png|right|thumb|A class size experiment in the United States found that attending small classes for 3 or more years in the early grades increased high school graduation of students from low income families.<ref name=finn>Finn, J.D.; Gerber, S.B.; Boyd-Zaharias, J. (2005). Small classes in the early grades, academic achievement, and graduating from high school. ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 97, 214–33.</ref>]]
Research on [[classroom management]] and [[pedagogy]] is conducted to guide teaching practice and form a foundation for teacher education programs. The goals of classroom management are to create an environment conducive to learning and to develop students' self-management skills. More specifically, classroom management strives to create positive teacher–student and peer relationships, manage student groups to sustain on-task behavior, and use counseling and other psychological methods to aid students who present persistent psychosocial problems.<ref name=emmer>Emmer, E.T. & Stough, L.M. (2001). Classroom management: A critical part of educational psychology with implications for teacher education. ''Educational Psychologist'', 36, 103–12.</ref>

Introductory educational psychology is a commonly required area of study in most North American teacher education programs. When taught in that context, its content varies, but it typically emphasizes learning theories (especially cognitively oriented ones), issues about motivation, assessment of students' learning, and classroom management. A developing [[b:Contemporary Educational Psychology|Wikibook about educational psychology]] gives more detail about the educational psychology topics that are typically presented in preservice teacher education.

====Training====
In order to become an educational psychologist, students can complete an undergraduate degree in their choice. They then must go to graduate school to study education psychology, counseling psychology, and/ or school counseling. Most students today are also receiving their doctorate degrees in order to hold the "psychologist" title. Educational psychologists work in a variety of settings. Some work in university settings where they carry out research on the cognitive and social processes of human development, learning and education. Educational psychologists may also work as consultants in designing and creating educational materials, classroom programs and online courses.Educational psychologists who work in k–12 school settings (closely related are [[school psychologist]]s in the US and Canada) are trained at the [[master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] levels. In addition to conducting assessments, school psychologists provide services such as academic and behavioral intervention, counseling, teacher consultation, and crisis intervention. However, school psychologists are generally more individual-oriented towards students.<ref name= Love>Love, P. (2009). Educational psychologists: the early search for an identity. Educational Psychology In Practice, 25(1), 3-8.</ref>

Many colleges and high schools are starting to teach students how to teach students in the classroom. In colleges educational psychology is starting to be a general education requirement.

====Employment outlook====
Employment for psychologists in the United States is expected to grow faster than most occupations through the year 2014, with anticipated growth of 18–26%. One in four psychologists are employed in educational settings. In the United States, the [[median]] [[salary]] for psychologists in primary and secondary schools is US$58,360 as of May 2004.<ref name=OOH>Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. ''Occupational Outlook Handbook''. 2006–07 Edition. Psychologists. retrieved from http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos056.htm on June 30, 2006.</ref> Colleges offer and allow someone to obtain a PHD in educational Psychology.

In recent decades the participation of women as professional researchers in North American educational psychology has risen dramatically.<ref name=evans>Evans, J.; Hsieh, P.P. & Robinson, D.H. (2005). Women's Involvement in educational psychology journals from 1976 to 2004. ''Educational Psychology Review'', 17, 263–71.</ref>

==Methods of research==
Educational psychology, as much as any other field of [[psychology]] heavily relies on a balance of pure [[observation]] and quantitative methods in [[psychology]]. The study of [[education]] generally combines the studies of [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[ethics]] with theoretical approaches. Smeyers and Depaepe explain that historically, the study of education and child rearing have been associated with the interests of policymakers and practitioners within the educational field, however, the recent shift to [[sociology]] and [[psychology]] has opened the door for new findings in education as a [[social science]]. Now being its own academic discipline, educational psychology has proven to be helpful for social science researchers.<ref name=Smeyers>Smeyers, Paul; Depaepe, Marc. The Lure of Psychology for Education and Educational Research. "The Journal of Educational Philosophy", (2012) 46, 315-331.</ref>

Quantitative research is the backing to most observable phenomena in [[psychology]]. This involves observing, creating, and understanding a distribution of data based upon the studies subject matter. Researchers use particular variables to interpret their data distributions from their research and employ statistics as a way of creating data tables and analyzing their data. [[Psychology]] has moved from the "common sense" reputations initially posed by Thomas Reid to the methodology approach comparing independent and dependent variables through natural [[observation]], [[experiment]]s, or combinations of the two. Though results are still, with statistical methods, objectively true based upon significance variables or p- values.<ref name="Smeyers"/>
