'''''EastEnders''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[soap opera]] created by [[Julia Smith]] and [[Tony Holland]] which has been broadcast on [[BBC One]] since 1985. Set in [[Albert Square]] in the [[East End of London]] in the fictional Borough of [[Walford]], the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives. Initially there were two 30-minute episodes per week, later increasing to three, but since 2001 episodes have been broadcast every [[weekday]] apart from Wednesdays.

Within eight months of the show's launch, it reached the number-one spot in [[Broadcaster's Audience Research Board|BARB]]'s TV ratings and has consistently remained among the top-rated TV programmes in Britain. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a502337/coronation-street-79m-watch-paul-and-lloyds-showdown.html|title='Coronation Street': 7.9m watch Paul and Lloyd's showdown|website=Digital Spy|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref> Today, ''EastEnders'' remains a significant programme in terms of the BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many dilemmas that are considered to be controversial and [[taboo]] issues in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]] and social life previously unseen on United Kingdom mainstream television.<ref>Pamela Demory, Christopher Pullen (2013).

== History ==
=== Conception and preparations for broadcast ===
In March 1983, under two years before ''EastEnders''{{'}} first episode was broadcast, the show was a vague idea in the mind of a handful of BBC executives, who decided that what [[BBC1]] needed was a popular bi-weekly drama series that would attract the kind of mass audiences that ITV was getting with ''[[Coronation Street]]''.<ref name="20years p10">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=10}}</ref> The first people to whom David Reid, then head of series and serials, turned were [[Julia Smith]] and [[Tony Holland]], a well established producer/script editor team who had first worked together on ''[[Z-Cars]]''.<ref name="20years p10" /> The outline that Reid presented was vague: two episodes a week, 52 weeks a year.<ref name="20years p11">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=11}}</ref> After the concept was put to them on 14 March 1983, Smith and Holland then went about putting their ideas down on paper; they decided it would be set in the East End of London.<ref name="20years p10" /> [[Granada Television]] gave Smith unrestricted access to the ''Coronation Street'' production for a month so that she could get a sense how a continuing drama was produced.<ref>{{cite web|format=podcast |url=http://ax.itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/daily-bacon/id292077536 |title=Daily Bacon: Coronation Street |publisher=BBC Radio 5Live |author=Richard Bacon, host |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303052823/http://ax.itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/daily-bacon/id292077536 |archivedate=3 March 2012 }}</ref>

There was anxiety at first that the viewing public would not accept a new soap set in the south of England, though research commissioned by lead figures in the BBC revealed that southerners would accept a northern soap, northerners would accept a southern soap and those from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], as Julia Smith herself pointed out, did not mind where it was set as long as it was somewhere else.<ref name="20years p11" /> This was the beginning of a close and continuing association between ''EastEnders'' and audience research, which, though commonplace today, was something of a revolution in practice.<ref name="20years p11" />

The show's creators were both Londoners, but when they researched Victorian squares, they found massive changes in areas they thought they knew well. However, delving further into the East End of London, they found exactly what they had been searching for: a real East End spirit—an inward looking quality, a distrust of strangers and authority figures, a sense of territory and community that the creators summed up as "Hurt one of us and you hurt us all".<ref name="20years p11" />

When developing ''EastEnders'', both Smith and Holland looked at influential models like ''Coronation Street'', but they found that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life. Only after ''EastEnders'' began, and featured the characters of [[Tony Carpenter]] and [[Kelvin Carpenter]], did ''Coronation Street'' start to feature black characters, for example.<ref>"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/02/03/bfpa03.xml Hole at the heart of the BBC]", ''The Telegraph''. Retrieved 25 February 2007</ref> They came to the conclusion that ''Coronation Street'' had grown old with its audience, and that ''EastEnders'' would have to attract a younger, more socially extensive audience, ensuring that it had the longevity to retain it for many years thereafter.<ref name="20years">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=<!-- Page numbers needed -->}}</ref> They also looked at ''[[Brookside]]'' but found there was a lack of central meeting points for the characters, making it difficult for the writers to intertwine different storylines, so ''EastEnders'' was set in [[Albert Square]].<ref name="Public secrets page 15">{{Harvnb|Buckingham|1987|p=15}}</ref>

A previous UK soap set in an East End market was [[Associated TeleVision|ATV]]'s ''[[Market in Honey Lane]]'' between 1967 and 1969. However this show, which graduated from one showing a week to two in three separate series (the latter series being shown in different time slots across the ITV network) was very different in style and approach to ''EastEnders''. The British Film Institute described ''Market In Honey Lane'' thus: "It was not an earth-shaking programme, and certainly not pioneering in any revolutionary ideas in technique and production, but simply proposed itself to the casual viewer as a mildly pleasant affair."<ref>{{cite web|title=Market on Honey Lane / Honey Lane (1967–69)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1400806/index.html|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> ''EastEnders'', while also featuring an East End street market, would be very different in its approach and impact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The target launch date was originally January 1985.<ref name="Insidestory p24">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=24}}</ref> Smith and Holland had eleven months in which to write, cast and shoot the whole thing. However, in February 1984, they did not even have a title or a place to film. Both Smith and Holland were unhappy about the January 1985 launch date, favouring November or even September 1984 when seasonal audiences would be higher, but the BBC stayed firm, and Smith and Holland had to concede that, with the massive task of getting the Elstree Studios operational, January was the most realistic date. However, this was later to be changed to February.<ref name="Insidestory p24" />

The project had a number of working titles—''Square Dance'', ''Round the Square'', ''Round the Houses'', ''London Pride'' and ''East 8''.<ref name="eehistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/qa/qa_content/qa_0005.shtml|title= What is the history of ''EastEnders''?]|publisher=BBC Online|accessdate=13 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219122918/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/qa/qa_content/qa_0005.shtml|archivedate=19 February 2006}}</ref> It was the latter that stuck (E8 is the postcode for Hackney) in the early months of creative process.<ref name="20years p15">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=15}}</ref> However, the show was renamed after many casting agents mistakenly thought the show was to be called ''Estate'', and the fictional postcode E20 was created, instead of using E8.<ref name="20years p15" /> Julia Smith came up with the name ''Eastenders'' after she and Holland had spent months telephoning theatrical agents and asking "Do you have any real East Enders on your books?"<ref name="20years p15" /> However, Smith thought "''Eastenders''" "looked ugly written down" and was "hard to say", so decided to capitalise the second 'e'.<ref name="20years p15" />

==== Initial character creation and casting ====
[[File:Dot Lou Ethel ee.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dot Cotton]], [[Ethel Skinner]] and [[Lou Beale]] were Walford's original pensioners.|alt=refer to caption]]
After they decided on the filming location of [[BBC Elstree Centre]] in [[Hertfordshire]], Smith and Holland set about creating the 23 characters needed, in just 14 days.<ref name="Insidestory p164">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=164}}</ref> They took a holiday in Playa de los Pocillos, [[Lanzarote]], and started to create the characters.<ref name="Insidestory p48">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=48}}</ref> Holland created the [[Beale family|Beale and Fowler family]], drawing on his own background. His mother, Ethel Holland, was one of four sisters raised in Walthamstow. Her eldest sister, Lou, had married a man named Albert Beale and had two children, named Peter and Pauline.<ref name="Insidestory p49">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=49}}</ref> These family members were the basis for [[Lou Beale]], [[Pete Beale]] and [[Pauline Fowler]]. Holland also created Pauline's unemployed husband [[Arthur Fowler]], their children [[Mark Fowler]] and [[Michelle Fowler]], Pete's wife [[Kathy Beale]] and their son [[Ian Beale]].<ref name="Insidestory p51-56" /> Smith used her personal memories of East End residents she met when researching Victorian squares.<ref name="Insidestory p15">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=15}}</ref> [[Ethel Skinner]] was based on an old woman she met in a pub, with ill-fitting false teeth, and a "face to rival a neon sign", holding a [[Yorkshire Terrier]] in one hand and a pint of [[Guinness]] in the other.<ref name="Insidestory p52">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=52}}</ref> Other characters created included Jewish doctor [[Harold Legg]], the Anglo-Cypriot Osman family, [[Ali Osman]], [[Sue Osman]] and baby [[Hassan Osman]], black father and son, [[Tony Carpenter]] and [[Kelvin Carpenter]], single mother [[Mary Smith (EastEnders)|Mary Smith]] and Bangladeshi couple [[Saeed Jeffery]] and [[Naima Jeffery]]. Jack, Pearl and Tracey Watts were created to bring "flash, trash, and melodrama" to the Square (they were later renamed [[Den Watts|Den]], [[Angie Watts|Angie]] and [[Sharon Watts]]). The characters of [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] and [[Debbie Wilkins]] were created to show a modern couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, and [[Lofty Holloway]] to show an outsider; someone who did not fit in with other residents. It was decided that he would be a former soldier, as Holland's personal experiences of ex-soldiers were that they had trouble fitting into society after being in the army. When they compared the characters they had created, Smith and Holland realised they had created a cross-section of East End residents. The Beale and Fowler family represented the old families of the East End, who had always been there. The Osmans, Jefferys and Carpenters represented the more modern diverse ethnic community of the East End. Debbie, Andy and Mary represented more modern-day individuals.<ref name="20years" />

Once they had decided on their 23 characters, they returned to London for a meeting with the BBC. Everyone agreed that ''EastEnders'' would be tough, violent on occasion, funny and sharp—set in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain—and it would start with a bang (namely the death of [[Reg Cox]]). They decided that none of their existing characters were wicked enough to have killed Reg, so a 24th character, [[Nick Cotton]] was added to the line-up. He was a racist thug, who often tried to lead other young characters astray.<ref name="20years p20">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=20}}</ref> When all the characters had been created, Smith and Holland set about casting the actors for the show.

==== Final preparations ====

Through the next few months, the set was growing rapidly at Elstree, and a composer and designer had been commissioned to create the title sequence. [[Simon May]] wrote the [[EastEnders theme tune|theme music]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/qa/qa_content/qa_0008.shtml |title=Who wrote the thee tune?|publisher=BBC Online|accessdate=29 October 2006}}</ref> and Alan Jeapes created the visuals.<ref name="Insidestory p97">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=97}}</ref> The visual images were taken from an aircraft flying over the East End of London at 1000 feet. Approximately 800 photographs were taken and pieced together to create one big image.<ref name="Opening credits" /> The credits were later updated when the [[Millennium Dome]] was built.<ref name="Opening credits">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/qa/qa_content/qa_0001.shtml|title=How did you get the view of London used on the opening credits?|website=EastEnders|publisher=BBC Online|accessdate=13 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831031758/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/qa/qa_content/qa_0001.shtml|archivedate=31 August 2006}}</ref>

The launch was delayed until February 1985<ref name="Insidestory p154">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=154}}</ref> due to a delay in the chat show ''Wogan'', that was to be a part of the major revamp in BBC1's schedules. Smith was uneasy about the late start as ''EastEnders'' no longer had the winter months to build up a loyal following before the summer ratings lull. The press were invited to Elstree to meet the cast and see the lot, and stories immediately started circulating about the show, about a rivalry with [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (who were launching their own market-based soap, ''[[Albion Market]]'') and about the private lives of the cast.<ref name="20years page 17">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=17}}</ref> Anticipation and rumour grew in equal measure until the first transmission at 7{{nbsp}}p.m. on 19 February 1985.<ref name="20years page 17" /> Both Holland and Smith could not watch; they both instead returned to the place where it all began, Albertine's Wine Bar on Wood Lane.<ref name="20years page 17" /> The next day, viewing figures were confirmed at 17{{nbsp}}million.<ref name="20years page 17" /> The reviews were largely favourable,<ref name="20years page 17" /> although, after three weeks on air, BBC1's early evening share had returned to the pre-''EastEnders'' figure of seven million, though ''EastEnders'' then climbed to highs of up to 23{{nbsp}}million later on in the year.<ref name="Rating 1986">{{harvnb|Slide|1996|p=35}}</ref> Following the launch, both group discussions and telephone surveys were conducted to test audience reaction to early episodes.

=== 1980s broadcast history ===
Press coverage of ''EastEnders'', which was already intense, went into overdrive once the show was broadcast. With public interest so high, the media began investigating the private lives of the show's popular stars. Within days, a scandalous headline appeared —"EASTENDERS STAR IS A KILLER". This referred to [[Leslie Grantham]], and his prison sentence for the murder of a taxi driver in an attempted robbery nearly 20 years earlier. This shocking tell-all style set the tone for relations between [[Albert Square]] and the press for the next 20 years.

The show's first episode attracted some 17{{nbsp}}million viewers, and it continued to attract high viewing figures from then on.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/08/eastenders-bbc-25-years | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Dan | last=Sabbagh | title=Is EastEnders the lifeblood of the BBC? | date=8 February 2010}}</ref> By Christmas 1985, the tabloids couldn't get enough of the show. 'Exclusives' about ''EastEnders'' storylines and the actors on the show became a staple of tabloid buyers daily reading.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Writer [[Colin Brake]] suggested that 1989 was a year of big change for ''EastEnders'', both behind the cameras and in front of them. Original production designer, Keith Harris, left the show, and Holland and Smith both decided that the time had come to move on too; their final contribution coinciding with the exit of one of ''EastEnders'' most successful characters, Den Watts ([[Leslie Grantham]]).<ref name="first10years" /> Producer [[Mike Gibbon]] was given the task of running the show and he enlisted the most experienced writers to take over the storylining of the programme, including Charlie Humphreys, Jane Hollowood and [[Tony McHale]].<ref name="First10Years p70" />

According to Brake, the departure of two of the soap's most popular characters, Den and Angie Watts ([[Anita Dobson]]), left a void in the programme, which needed to be filled.<ref name="first10years" /> In addition, several other long-running characters left the show that year including Sue and Ali Osman ([[Sandy Ratcliff]] and [[Nejdet Salih]]) and their family; [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]); [[Carmel Jackson]] ([[Judith Jacob]]) and [[Colin Russell (EastEnders)|Colin Russell]] ([[Michael Cashman]]). Brake indicated that the production team decided that 1989 was to be a year of change in Walford, commenting, "it was almost as if Walford itself was making a fresh start".<ref name="First10Years p75-76">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|pp=75–76}}</ref>

By the end of 1989 ''EastEnders'' had acquired a new executive producer, [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], who had previously been a successful producer on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[The Bill]]''. Brake suggested that Ferguson was responsible for bringing in a new sense of vitality and creating a programme that was more in touch with the real world than it had been over the previous year.<ref name="First10Years p70" />

=== Changes in the 1990s ===
A new era began in 1990 with the introduction of [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]])—the Mitchell brothers—successful characters who would go on to dominate the soap thereafter.<ref name="First10Years p91">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=91}}</ref> As the new production team cleared the way for new characters and a new direction, all of the characters introduced under Gibbon were axed from the show at the start of the year.<ref name="First10Years p90">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=90}}</ref> Ferguson introduced other characters and was responsible for storylines including HIV, Alzheimer's disease and murder.

[[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] became the Executive Producer of ''EastEnders'' in 2000. Yorke was given the task of introducing the soap's fourth weekly episode. He axed the majority of the Di Marco family and helped introduce popular characters such as the [[Slater family (EastEnders)|Slater family]]. As what [[Mal Young]] described as "two of ''EastEnders'' most successful years", Yorke was responsible for highly rated storylines such as "[[Who Shot Phil?]]", [[Ethel Skinner]]'s death, [[Jim Branning]] and [[Dot Cotton]]'s marriage, [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]]'s domestic abuse of his wife [[Little Mo Morgan]], and [[Kat Slater]]'s revelation to her daughter [[Zoe Slater]] that she was her mother.

In 2002, [[Louise Berridge]] succeeded Yorke as the Executive Producer.

Berridge was responsible for some ratings success stories, such as Alfie and [[Kat Slater]]'s relationship, [[Janine Butcher]] getting her comeuppance, [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] and [[Jamie Mitchell]]'s death storylines and the return of one of the greatest soap icons, [[Den Watts]], who had been presumed dead for 14 years. His return in late 2003 was watched by over 16 million viewers, putting ''EastEnders'' back at number one in the rating war with the ''Coronation Street''.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3151484.stm Sixteen million watch Den's return]", ''BBC''.

In 2009, producers introduced a limit on the number of speaking parts in each episode due to budget cuts, with an average of 16 characters per episode. The decision was criticised by Martin McGrath of Equity, who said: "Trying to produce quality TV on the cheap is doomed to fail." The BBC responded by saying they had been working that way for some time and it had not affected the quality of the show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a182543/eastenders-limit-episodes-to-16-actors.html|title='EastEnders' limit episodes to 16 actors|first=Catriona|last=wightman|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref>

He told entertainment website [[Digital Spy]], "It's really important that the feel of the week is active and exciting and not too reflective. There'll be those moments for some of our longer-serving characters that briefly reflect on themselves and how they've changed. The characters don't know that it's the 25th anniversary of anything, so it'd be absurd to contrive too many situations in which they're reflective on the past.

Thus, central to Albert Square is [[The Queen Victoria]] Public House (also known as The Queen Vic or The Vic).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_queen_vic.shtml |title= What's the history of the Queen Vic? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220221434/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_queen_vic.shtml |archivedate=20 December 2006|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The show's producers based the square's design on [[Fassett Square]] in [[Dalston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hackney.gov.uk/xp-factsandfigures-placesfaces.htm|title=Interesting Places and Famous Faces|publisher=Hackney Borough Council|accessdate=13 December 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201727/http://www.hackney.gov.uk/xp-factsandfigures-placesfaces.htm#.WMSKuNKLSpo|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> There is also a market close to Fassett Square at [[Ridley Road Market|Ridley Road]].

Walford East is a fictional tube station for Walford, and a tube map that was first seen on air in 1996 showed Walford East between [[Bow Road tube station|Bow Road]] and [[West Ham tube station|West Ham]], in the actual location of [[Bromley-by-Bow tube station|Bromley-by-Bow]] on the [[District line|District]] and [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith & City]] lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://underground-history.co.uk/walford.php |title=Underground EastEnders|publisher=Underground History|accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref>

Walford has the [[postal district]] of E20. The postcode district was selected as if it were part of the actual [[E postcode area]] which covers much of east London although the next unused postcode district in the area was, and still is ({{as of|2016|lc=y}}), E19.<ref>Royal Mail, ''Address Management Guide'', (2004)</ref> The ''E'' stands for ''Eastern''.<ref name=inner>HMSO, ''The Inner London Letter Post'', (1980)</ref> In 1917 the postal districts in London were assigned alphabetically according to the name of the main [[sorting office]] for each district.<ref name=bpma>{{cite web|publisher=British Postal Museum and Archive |url=http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_Postcodes_web.pdf |title=Archive Information Sheet: Postcodes |accessdate=5 July 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320052708/http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_Postcodes_web.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2009 }}</ref> If Walford had been assigned in this scheme it would have been given E17, which is the postcode district for [[Walthamstow]].

''EastEnders'' is built around the idea of relationships and strong families, with each character having a place in the community. This theme encompasses the whole Square, making the entire community a family of sorts, prey to upsets and conflict, but pulling together in times of trouble. Co-creator [[Tony Holland]] was from a large East End family, and such families have typified ''EastEnders''.<ref name="Insidestory p49" /> The first central family was the combination of the [[Fowler family]], consisting of [[Pauline Fowler]], her husband [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]], and teenage children [[Mark Fowler|Mark]] and [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]]. Pauline's family, the [[Beale family|Beales]], consisted of Pauline's twin brother [[Pete Beale]], his wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] and their teenage son [[Ian Beale|Ian]]. Pauline and Pete's domineering mother [[Lou Beale]] lived with Pauline and her family. Holland drew on the names of his own family for the characters.<ref name="Insidestory p51-56">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|pp=51–56}}</ref>

The [[Watts family|Watts]] and [[Mitchell family|Mitchell]] families have been central to many notable ''EastEnders'' storylines, the show having been dominated by the Watts in the 1980s, with the 1990s focusing on the Mitchells. The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female [[Slater family (EastEnders)|Slater clan]], before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. Since 2006, ''EastEnders'' has largely been dominated by the Mitchell and [[Branning family|Branning]] families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon family, and from 2013 onwards, on the [[Carter family (EastEnders)|Carters]]. The Beales are the show's longest running family, having been in ''EastEnders'' since it began in 1985.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Key people involved in the production of ''EastEnders'' have stressed how important the idea of strong families is to the programme.<ref name="Insidestory p49" /> [[Peggy Mitchell]], in particular, is notorious for her ceaseless repetition of such statements as "You're a Mitchell!" and "It's all about family!" Pauline Fowler is also known for her insistence on family and mentioning her brother and husband to instill loyalty from family members. Her mother Lou Beale is renowned for her family meetings and traditional approach to family. More recently, [[Derek Branning]] regularly expresses the importance of a strong family unit. As the eldest sibling, he is constantly asserting his position as head of his family and reminding everyone to pull together in times of trouble. Additionally, Derek commonly refers to himself, [[Max Branning]] and [[Jack Branning]] as "the Branning brothers."

''EastEnders'' has an emphasis on strong family [[matriarch]]s, with examples including [[Pauline Fowler]] and [[Peggy Mitchell]], helping to attract a female audience. [[John Yorke (producer)|John Yorke]], then the BBC's head of drama production, put this down to Tony Holland's "gay sensibility, which showed a love for strong women".<ref name="Lifeblood" /> The matriarchal role is one that has been seen in various reincarnations since the programme's inception, often depicted as the centre of the family unit.<ref name="20years p55">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=55}}</ref> The original matriarch was Lou Beale, though later examples include [[Mo Harris]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/eastenders/|title=EastEnders|last=Dougan|first=John|date=19 August 2002|website=PopMatters|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref> [[Pat Butcher]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/entertainment/eastenders-matriarch-for-xmas-exit-525722.html|title='EastEnders' matriarch for Xmas exit|date=25 October 2011|publisher=BreakingNews.ie|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref> [[Zainab Masood]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2248900/Nina-Wadia-quits-EastEnders-years-playing-Zainab-Masood.html|title=Nina Wadia quits EastEnders after five years of playing Zainab Masood|last=Sanders|first=Louise|date=16 December 2012|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=18 January 2013|location=London}}</ref> and [[Cora Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/ww/spotlight/4108/exclusive-qa-bryan-kirkwood |title=Exclusive: Q&A with Bryan Kirkwood |date=20 June 2011 |publisher=Walford Web |accessdate=19 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930053732/http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/ww/spotlight/4108/exclusive-qa-bryan-kirkwood |archivedate=30 September 2012 }}</ref> These characters are seen as being loud and interfering but most importantly, responsible for the well-being of the family<ref name="redpepper" /> and usually stressing the importance of family, reflecting on the past.

The show often includes strong, brassy, long-suffering women who exhibit [[diva]]-like behaviour and stoically battle through an array of tragedy and misfortune.<ref name="redpepper">{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229113716/http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html |archivedate=29 December 2006 |title=Square deal|publisher=Redpepper|accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> Such characters include [[Angie Watts]], [[Kathy Beale]], [[Sharon Watts]], Pat Butcher, [[Denise Fox]] and [[Tanya Branning]]. Conversely there are female characters who handle tragedy less well, depicted as eternal victims and endless sufferers, who include [[Sue Osman]], [[Little Mo Mitchell]], [[Laura Beale]], [[Lisa Fowler]], [[Ronnie Mitchell]] and [[Linda Carter]]. The '[[Hooker with a heart of gold|tart with a heart']] is another recurring character, often popular with viewers. Often their [[promiscuity]] masks a hidden [[vulnerability]] and a desire to be loved. Such characters have included Pat Butcher (though in her latter years, this changed), [[Tiffany Mitchell]], [[Kat Slater]],<ref name="Dowling">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4695877.stm|title=Will Kat's exit harm EastEnders?|last=Dowling|first=Stephen|date=19 July 2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref> [[Stacey Slater]], [[Dawn Swann]], [[Roxy Mitchell]] and [[Whitney Dean]].

A gender balance in the show is maintained via the inclusion of various "macho" male personalities such as [[Mick Carter]], [[Phil Mitchell]], [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]], [[Jack Branning]] and [[Max Branning]], "bad boys" such as [[Den Watts]], [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] and [[Vincent Hubbard]], and "heartthrobs" such as [[Simon Wicks]], [[Jamie Mitchell]], [[Dennis Rickman]] and [[Joey Branning]].

Over the years ''EastEnders'' has typically featured a number of elderly residents, who are used to show vulnerability, [[nostalgia]], stalwart-like attributes and are sometimes used for comedic purposes. The original elderly residents included Lou Beale, [[Ethel Skinner]] and [[Dot Cotton]]. Over the years they have been joined by the likes of [[Mo Butcher]], [[Jules Tavernier (EastEnders)|Jules Tavernier]], [[Marge Green]], [[Nellie Ellis]], [[Jim Branning]], [[Charlie Slater]], [[Mo Harris]], [[Patrick Trueman]], [[Cora Cross]], [[Les Coker]], [[Rose Cotton (EastEnders)|Rose Cotton]], [[Pam Coker]], [[Stan Carter]], [[Babe Smith]], [[Claudette Hubbard]], [[Sylvie Carter]], [[Ted Murray]] and [[Joyce Murray]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Focus on elderly characters has decreased since the show's inception.

''EastEnders'' has always featured a culturally diverse cast which has included [[black people|black]], Asian, [[Turkish people|Turkish]], Polish and Latvian characters. "The expansion of minority representation signals a move away from the traditional soap opera format, providing more opportunities for audience identification with the characters and hence a wider appeal".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/eastenders.htm |title=EastEnders |website=museum.tv |first=Danielle|last=Aron |first2=Sonia|last2=Livingston |accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412075647/http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew06m.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm |url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew06m.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm |archivedate=12 April 2006|title= Coronation Street and EastEnders battle it out for coveted CRE Race in the Media Award|publisher=cre.gov.uk|accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> Despite this, the programme has been criticised by the [[Commission for Racial Equality]], who argued in 2002 that ''EastEnders'' was not giving a realistic representation of the East End's "ethnic make-up". They suggested that the average proportion of visible minority faces on ''EastEnders'' was substantially lower than the actual ethnic minority population in East London boroughs, and it therefore reflected the East End in the 1960s, not the East End of the 2000s.

<!-- Note that this section is for types of storylines featured in EastEnders in general, not for details on individual storylines -->''EastEnders'' programme makers took the decision that the show was to be about "everyday life" in the inner city "today" and regarded it as a "slice of life".<ref name="Geraghty page 32">{{Harvnb|Geraghty|1991|p=32}}</ref> Creator/producer Julia Smith declared that "We don't make life, we reflect it".<ref name="Geraghty page 32" /> She also said, "We decided to go for a realistic, fairly outspoken type of drama which could encompass stories about homosexuality, rape, unemployment, [[racism|racial prejudice]], etc., in a believable context. Above all, we wanted [[Realism (arts)|realism]]".<ref name="Geraghty page 16">{{Harvnb|Geraghty|1991|p=16}}</ref> In 2011, the head of BBC drama, [[John Yorke (producer)|John Yorke]], said that the real East End had changed significantly since ''EastEnders'' started, and the show no longer truly reflected real life, but that it had an "emotional truthfulness" and was partly "true to the original vision" and partly "adapt[ing] to a changing world", adding that "If it was a show where every house cost a fortune and everyone drove a Lexus, it wouldn't be ''EastEnders''. You have to show shades of that change, but certain things are immutable, I would argue, like The Vic and the market."<ref name="Not realistic">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a318721/eastenders-walford-not-realistic-says-bbc-boss/|title='EastEnders' Walford not realistic, says BBC boss|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=10 May 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=12 April 2017}}</ref>

In the 1980s, ''EastEnders'' featured "gritty" storylines involving drugs and crime, representing the issues faced by working-class Britain under [[Thatcherism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1997|p=79}}</ref> Storylines included the cot death of 14-month-old [[Hassan Osman]], [[Nick Cotton]]'s [[homophobia]], racism and murder of [[Reg Cox]],<ref name="issues">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_issues.shtml |title= Which issues have been highlighted by ''EastEnders''? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223225130/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/yourquestions/yourq_content/yourq_issues.shtml |archivedate=23 February 2007|publisher=BBC}}</ref> [[Arthur Fowler]]'s unemployment reflecting the recession of the 1980s, the rape of [[Kathy Beale]] in 1988 by [[James Willmott-Brown]]<ref name="issues" /> and [[Michelle Fowler]]'s teenage pregnancy. The show also dealt with prostitution, mixed-race relationships, shoplifting, sexism, divorce, domestic violence and mugging. In 1989, the programme came under criticism in the British media for being too depressing, and according to writer [[Colin Brake]], the programme makers were determined to change this.<ref name="First10Years p70" /> In 1989, there was a deliberate attempt to increase the lighter, more comic aspects of life in Albert Square. This led to the introduction of some characters who were deliberately conceived as comic or light-hearted.<ref name="First10Years p70" /> Brake suggested that humour was an important element in ''EastEnders''{{'}} storylines during 1989, with a greater amount of slapstick and light comedy than before. He classed 1989's changes as a brave experiment, and suggested that while some found this period of ''EastEnders'' entertaining, many other viewers felt that the comedy stretched the programme's credibility.<ref name="First10Years p70" /> Although the programme still covered many issues in 1989, such as domestic violence, drugs, rape and racism, Brake reflected that the new emphasis on a more balanced mix between "light and heavy storylines" gave the illusion that the show had lost a "certain edge".<ref name="First10Years p70" />

As the show progressed into the 1990s, ''EastEnders'' still featured hard-hitting issues such as Mark Fowler revealing he was [[HIV]] positive<ref name="issues" /> in 1991, the death of his wife [[Gill Fowler|Gill]] from an AIDS-related illness in 1992, murder, [[adoption]], abortion, [[Peggy Mitchell]]'s battle with breast cancer,<ref name="issues" /> and [[Phil Mitchell]]'s alcoholism and violence towards wife Kathy. [[mental disorder|Mental health issues]] were confronted in 1996 when 16-year-old [[Joe Wicks]] developed [[schizophrenia]] following the off-screen death of his sister in a car crash. The long-running storyline of Mark Fowler's HIV was so successful in raising awareness that in 1999, a survey by the National Aids Trust found teenagers got most of their information about HIV from the soap, though one campaigner noted that in some ways the storyline was not reflective of what was happening at the time as the condition was more common among the [[gay community]]. Still, heterosexual Mark struggled with various issues connected to his HIV status, including public fears of contamination, a marriage breakdown connected to his inability to have children and the side effects of combination therapies.<ref name="ko">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2580435.stm|title=EastEnders' Mark to be killed off|publisher=BBC|date=16 December 2002|accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref>

In the early 2000s, ''EastEnders'' covered the issue of [[euthanasia]] ([[Ethel Skinner]]'s death in a pact with her friend [[Dot Branning|Dot Cotton]]), the unveiling of Kat Slater's abuse by her uncle [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry]] as a child (which led to the birth of her daughter [[Zoe Slater|Zoe]], who had been brought up to believe that Kat was her sister), the domestic abuse of Little Mo Morgan by husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor]] (which involved rape and culminated in Trevor's death after he tried to kill Little Mo in a fire),<ref name="issues" /> [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]] giving birth at the age of 15 and then putting her baby up for adoption, and [[Janine Butcher]]'s prostitution, [[agoraphobia]] and [[drug addiction]]. The soap also tackled the issue of mental illness and carers of people who have mental conditions, illustrated with mother and daughter [[Jean Slater|Jean]] and [[Stacey Slater]]; Jean suffers from [[bipolar disorder]], and teenage daughter Stacey was her carer (this storyline won a Mental Health Media Award in September 2006<ref name="mental">"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070207053634/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_content/news_20060905_n1.shtml Mental Health Media Awards 2006]" BBC.

Aside from this, soap opera staples of youthful romance, jealousy, domestic rivalry, gossip and extramarital affairs are regularly featured, with high-profile storylines occurring several times a year. [[Whodunit]]s also feature regularly, including the "[[Who Shot Phil?]]" storyline in 2001 that attracted over 19 million viewers and was one of the biggest successes in British soap television, the "[[Who Killed Archie?]]" story, which was revealed in a special live episode of the show that drew a peak of 17 million viewers, and "[[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]".

=== Set ===
[[File:EastEnders set.jpg|thumb|The Butcher/Jackson living room in 2008.|alt=refer to caption]]
The exterior set for the fictional Albert Square is located in the permanent [[backlot]] of the [[BBC Elstree Centre]], [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]], at {{coord|51|39|32|N|0|16|40|W|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}, and is outdoors and open to the weather.<ref name="Set">{{cite web|title=EastEnders Set|url=https://www.google.com/maps/@51.6586784,-0.2775168,70m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en-GB|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref> It was initially built in 1984 with a specification that it should last for at least 15 years at a cost of £750,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kingsley|1991|p=9}}</ref> The ''EastEnders'' lot was designed by Keith Harris, who was a senior designer within the production team together with supervising art directors Peter Findley and Gina Parr.<ref name="Londonist">{{cite web|last1=Venables|first1=Ben|title=The Story Behind The Set Of EastEnders|url=http://londonist.com/2015/01/exclusive-the-story-behind-the-sets-of-eastenders|publisher=[[londonist]]|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref> The main buildings on the square consisted originally of hollow shells, constructed from marine plywood facades mounted onto steel frames.<ref name="20years p146">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=146}}</ref> The lower walls, pavements, etc., were constructed of real brick and tarmac. The set had to be made to look as if it had been standing for years. This was done by a number of means, including chipping the pavements, using chemicals to crack the top layer of the paint work, using varnish to create damp patches underneath the railway bridge, and making garden walls in such a way they appeared to sag.<ref name="1987 Annual p43">{{Harvnb|Barraclough|1986|p=43}}</ref> The final touches were added in summer 1984, these included a [[telephone box]], [[telegraph pole]] that was provided by [[British Telecom]], [[lamppost]]s that were provided by [[Hertsmere Borough Council]] and a number of vehicles parked on the square.<ref name="1987 Annual p43" /> On each set all the appliances are fully functional such as gas cookers, the laundry washing machines and [[The Queen Victoria]] beer pumps.<ref name="1987 Annual p43" />

The walls were intentionally built crooked to give them an aged appearance.<ref name="20years p146" /> The drains around the set are real so rainwater can naturally flow from the streets.<ref name="Insidestory p43">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=43}}</ref> The square was built in two phases with only three sides being built, plus Bridge Street, to begin with in 1984, in time to be used for the show's first episode.<ref name="Insidestory p95">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=95}}</ref> Then in 1986, Harris added an extension to the set, building the fourth side of Albert Square, and in 1987, Turpin Road began to be featured more, which included buildings such as The Dagmar.<ref name="First10Years p19-20">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|pp=19–20}}</ref>

In 1993, George Street was added, and soon after [[Walford East tube station|Walford East Underground station]] was built, to create further locations when ''EastEnders'' went from two to three episodes per week. The set was constructed by the BBC in-house construction department under construction manager Mike Hagan. The initial build took six months to complete.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Most of the buildings on Albert Square have no interior filming space, with a few exceptions, and most do not have rears or gardens. Most areas by the front (and sometimes back) doors are decorated and dressed to match the interior set to allow shots of doors being opened.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The grocery shop was originally open fronted, it was turned into a closed front shop, with removable interior walls to allow for filming inside the shop when the set was expanded in 1987.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Some interior shots are filmed in the actual buildings, and the café also has some interior decoration so some limited filming can take place by the door.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The newer exterior sets including fish and chip shop, video shop and beauty salon had some interior filming space to create a greater sense of realism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} As the show is filmed up to six weeks in advance, the trees need to have extra leaves stuck on them during the spring to make them look like they would in summer.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In February 2008, it was reported that the set would transfer to [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], where a new set would be built<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3386610.ece |title=Sets too shabby for latest TVs force EastEnders out of town|date=18 February 2008|work=Times Online|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013170154/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3386610.ece|archivedate=13 October 2008}}</ref> as the set was looking "shabby", with its flaws showing up on [[high-definition television]] broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Chris|title=High-definition television forces BBC to fix sets|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/high-definition-television-forces-bbc-to-fix-its-sets-1757472.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=1 May 2017|date=22 July 2009}}</ref> However, by April 2010 a follow-up report confirmed that Albert Square would remain at Elstree Studios for at least another four years, taking the set through its 25th anniversary.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/28/eastenders-elstree-studios EastEnders to stay at Elstree Studios] Guardian</ref> The set was consequently rebuilt for high definition on the same site, using mostly real brick with some areas using a new improved plastic brick. Throughout rebuilding filming would still take place, and so scaffolding was often seen on screen during the process, with some storylines written to accommodate the rebuilding, such as the [[Queen Vic Fire Week|Queen Vic fire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=TV Set Support Eastenders|url=http://www.mediastructures.co.uk/portfolio/tv-set-support-eastenders/|publisher=Media Structures Ltd|accessdate=5 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230160331/http://www.mediastructures.co.uk/portfolio/tv-set-support-eastenders/|archivedate=30 December 2016}}</ref>

In 2014, then executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] said that he wanted Albert Square to look like a real-life east London neighbourhood so that the soap would "better reflect the more fashionable areas of east London beloved of young professionals" giving a flavour of the "creeping gentrification" of east London. He added: "It should feel more like London.

''EastEnders'' is often filmed on location, away from the studios in Borehamwood. Sometimes an entire quartet is filmed on location, which has a practical function and are the result of ''EastEnders'' making a "double bank", when an extra week's worth of episodes are recorded at the same time as the regular schedule, enabling the production of the programme to stop for a two-week break at Christmas. These episodes often air in late June or early July and again in late October or early November.<ref name="first10years">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=<!-- page numbers needed for each of the 21 references to this book, cite each one separately with this template -->}}</ref> The first time this happened was in December 1985 when [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) and [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]) travelled to the [[Southend-on-Sea]] to find their son [[Mark Fowler|Mark]], who had run away from home.<ref name="First10Years p36">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=36}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Episode dated 31/12/1985|series= EastEnders|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|airdate=31 December 1985}}</ref> In 1986, ''EastEnders'' filmed overseas for the first time, in [[Venice]], and this was also the first time it was not filmed on videotape, as a union rule at the time prevented producers taking a video crew abroad and a film crew had to be used instead.<ref name="First10Years p46">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=46}}</ref> In 2011, it was reported that eight per cent of the series is filmed on location.<ref name="Cost of producing continuing drama" />

''EastEnders'' has featured seven live broadcasts. For its 25th anniversary in February 2010, a [[EastEnders Live|live episode]] was broadcast in which [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) was revealed as [[Archie Mitchell]]'s ([[Larry Lamb]]) killer. Turner was told only 30&nbsp;minutes before the live episode and to maintain suspense, she whispers this revelation to former lover and current father-in-law, Max Branning, in the very final moments of the live show. Many other cast members only found out at the same time as the public, when the episode was broadcast.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a177337/live-ep-for-eastenders-25th-anniversary/|title=Live ep for 'EastEnders' 25th anniversary|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=15 September 2009|accessdate=15 September 2009}}</ref> On 23 July 2012, a segment of [[Episode 4466|that evening's episode]] was screened live as [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) carried the [[Olympic Flame]] around Walford in preparation for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Nickie |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/2011/11/the-olympic-flame-comes-to-wal.shtml |title=EastEnders: The Olympic flame comes to Walford! |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> In February 2015, for the soap's 30th anniversary, [[EastEnders Live Week|five episodes in a week]] featured live inserts throughout them.

=== Post-production ===
Each episode should run for 27 minutes and 15 seconds, however, if any episode runs over or under then it is the job of post-production to cut or add scenes where appropriate. As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years'', after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made.<ref name="First10Years p142">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=142}}</ref> The episode was then copied onto [[D-3 (video)|D3 video]]. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the [[BBC]]'s technical standard for broadcasting.<ref name="First10Years p143">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=143}}</ref>

Since 2010, ''EastEnders'' no longer uses tapes in the recording or editing process. After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes that are needed. The sound team also have the capability to access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.<ref name="EastEnders Case Study">{{cite web|title=EastEnders|url=https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/?case_study=eastenders|publisher=[[BBC Studios]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>

=== Budgets and costs ===
According to the book ''How to Study Television'', in 1995 ''EastEnders'' cost the BBC £40,000 per episode on average.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sun, Sea, Sex, Sand and Conservatism in the Australian Television Soap Opera|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/62594/2/62594.pdf#page=3|publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> A 2012 agreement between the BBC, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] and the Personal Managers' Association set out the pay rate for ''EastEnders'' scripts as £137.70 per minute of transmission time (£4,131 for 30 minutes), which is 85 per cent of the rate for scripts for other BBC television series.

== Scheduling ==

=== Broadcast ===
Since 1985, ''EastEnders'' has remained at the centre of [[BBC One]]'s primetime schedule. Since 2001, it has been broadcast at 7:30{{nbsp}}pm on Tuesday and Thursday, and 8{{nbsp}}pm on Monday and Friday. ''EastEnders'' was originally broadcast twice weekly at 7:00{{nbsp}}pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 19 February 1985. However, in September 1985 the two episodes were moved to 7:30{{nbsp}}pm as [[Michael Grade]] did not want the soap running in direct competition with ''[[Emmerdale|Emmerdale Farm]]'', and this remained the same until 7 April 1994. The BBC had originally planned to take advantage of the 'summer break' that ''Emmerdale Farm'' usually took to capitalise on ratings, but [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV1]] added extra episodes and repeats so that ''Emmerdale Farm'' was not taken off the air over the summer. Realising the futility of the situation, Grade decided to move the show to the later 7:30{{nbsp}}pm slot,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Newcomb |first1=Horace |title=Encyclopedia of Television |date=2004 |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited |isbn=1 57958 394 6 |page=780 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NUXIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA780&#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper|newspaper= The Times|title= EastEnders loses the ratings battle|date= 15 August 1985|page= 3|issue= 62217|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=herlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS52007183&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|via=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]]|first=David|last=Hewson}}</ref> but to avoid tabloid speculation that it was a "panic move" on the BBC's behalf, they had to "dress up the presentation of that move in such a way as to protect the show" giving "all kinds of reasons" for the move.{{Fact|date=December 2018}}

''EastEnders'' output then increased to three times a week on Mondays, Tuesday and Thursdays from 11 April 1994 until 2 August 2001.<ref name="edures">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/howcani/howcani_content/howcani_0011.shtml |title= Educational resource (part one) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403175032/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/haveyoursay/howcani/howcani_content/howcani_0011.shtml |archivedate=3 April 2007|publisher=BBC}}</ref>
From 10 August 2001, ''EastEnders'' then added its fourth episode (shown on Fridays).<ref name="edures" /> This caused some controversy as it clashed with ''[[Coronation Street]]'', which at the time was moved to 8{{nbsp}}pm to make way for an hour-long episode of rural soap ''Emmerdale'' at 7{{nbsp}}pm. The move immediately provoked an angry response from ITV insiders, who argued that the BBC's last-minute move—only revealed at 3.30{{nbsp}}pm on the day—broke an unwritten scheduling rule that the two flagship soaps would not be put directly against each other. In this first head-to-head battle, ''EastEnders'' claimed victory over its rival.<ref>{{Cite news

=== Criticism ===
''EastEnders'' is the most complained about programme on the BBC.<ref name="Wadia bans children">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1381341/EastEnders-Nina-Wadia-reveals-wont-let-kids-watch-adult-soap.html|title=EastEnder Nina Wadia admits she's banned her kids from watching her 'very adult' soap |last=Thomas|first=Liz|date=28 April 2011|work=Daily Mail |accessdate=28 April 2011|location=London}}</ref> It has received both praise and criticism for most of its storylines, which have dealt with difficult themes, such as violence, rape, murder and child abuse.

==== Morality and violence ====
[[Mary Whitehouse]], social critic, argued at the time that ''EastEnders'' represented a violation of "family viewing time" and that it undermined the [[watershed (television)|watershed]] policy. She regarded ''EastEnders'' as a fundamental assault on the family and morality itself. She made reference to representation of family life and emphasis on psychological and emotional violence within the show. She was also critical of language such as "bleeding", "bloody hell", "bastard" and "for Christ's sake". However, Whitehouse also praised the programme, describing [[Michelle Fowler]]'s decision not to have an abortion as a "very positive storyline". She also felt that ''EastEnders'' had been cleaned up as a result of her protests, though she later commented that ''EastEnders'' had returned to its old ways. Her criticisms were widely reported in the tabloid press as ammunition in its existing hostility towards the BBC. The stars of ''Coronation Street'' in particular aligned themselves with Mary Whitehouse, gaining headlines such as "STREETS AHEAD! RIVALS LASH SEEDY EASTENDERS" and "CLEAN UP SOAP! Street Star Bill Lashes 'Steamy' EastEnders".<ref>{{Harvnb|Buckingham|1987|p=129}}</ref>

''EastEnders'' has been criticised for being too violent, most notably during a [[domestic violence]] storyline between [[Little Mo Morgan]] and her husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]]. As ''EastEnders'' is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against a scene in which Little Mo's face was pushed in gravy on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council. However, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. [[Erin Pizzey]], who became internationally famous for having started one of the first [[Women's shelter|women's refuges]], said that ''EastEnders'' had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one story than she had done in 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=EastEnders: Faith, Morality and Hope in the Community|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/yorke_stalbans.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=4 September 2002}}</ref> The character of [[Phil Mitchell]] (played by [[Steve McFadden]] since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children. On one occasion following a scene in an episode broadcast in October 2002, where Phil brutally beat his godson, [[Jamie Mitchell]] (Jack Ryder), 31 complaints came from viewers who watched the scenes.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2712133.stm BBC rapped over EastEnders] BBC News, last accessed on 31 January 2003</ref>

In 2003, cast member [[Shaun Williamson]], who was in the final months of his role of [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]], said that the programme had become much grittier over the past 10 to 15 years, and found it "frightening" that parents let their young children watch.<ref>{{cite news|title=EastEnders star slates violence |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3358789.stm |accessdate=19 June 2011 |publisher=BBC News |date=31 December 2003 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zY5wfFLZ?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3358789.stm |archivedate=19 June 2011 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

In 2005, the BBC was accused of anti-religious bias by a [[House of Lords]] committee, who cited ''EastEnders'' as an example. Dr. [[Indarjit Singh]], editor of the Sikh Messenger and patron of the World Congress of Faiths, said: "''EastEnders''{{'}} Dot Cotton is an example.

In 2008, ''EastEnders'', along with ''Coronation Street'', was criticised by [[Martin McGuinness]], then Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, for "the level of concentration around the pub" and the "antics portrayed in the [...] Queen Vic".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7245701.stm|title=McGuinness slams alcohol in soaps|date=14 February 2008|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=12 April 2017}}</ref>

==== Allegations of national and racial stereotypes ====
In 1997 [[EastEnders episodes in Ireland|several episodes were shot and set in Ireland]], resulting in criticisms for portraying the Irish in a negatively stereotypical way. Ted Barrington, the Irish Ambassador to the UK at the time, described the portrayal of Ireland as an "unrepresentative caricature", stating he was worried by the negative stereotypes and the images of drunkenness, backwardness and isolation. [[Jana Bennett]], the BBC's then director of production, later apologised for the episodes, stating on BBC1's news bulletin: "It is clear that a significant number of viewers have been upset by the recent episodes of ''EastEnders'', and we are very sorry, because the production team and programme makers did not mean to cause any offence." A year later BBC chairman Christopher Bland admitted that as result of the Irish-set EastEnders episodes, the station failed in its pledge to represent all groups accurately and avoid reinforcing prejudice.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/172718.stm BBC sets out pledges], BBC News.

In March 2008, scenes showing [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) and boyfriend, [[Sean Slater]] ([[Rob Kazinsky]]), burying Tanya's husband Max ([[Jake Wood]]) alive, attracted many complaints.

A spokesman of Ofcom said: "After carefully investigating complaints about this scene, Ofcom found the BBC took appropriate steps to limit offence to viewers.

==== Portrayal of certain professions ====
In 2010, ''EastEnders'' came under criticism from the police for the way that they were portrayed during the "[[Who Killed Archie?]]" storyline. During the storyline, [[Jill Marsden (EastEnders)|DCI Jill Marsden]] and [[Wayne Hughes (EastEnders)|DC Wayne Hughes]] talk to locals about the case and Hughes accepts a bribe. The police claimed that such scenes were "damaging" to their reputation and added that the character [[Deanne Cunningham|DC Deanne Cunningham]] was "irritatingly inaccurate". In response to the criticism, ''EastEnders'' apologised for offending real life detectives and confirmed that they use a police consultant for such storylines.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7288626/Detectives-claim-EastEnders-has-damaged-their-profession.html|title=Detectives claim EastEnders has 'damaged their profession'|last=Leach|first=Ben|date=22 February 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=22 February 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

In October 2012, a storyline involving [[Lola Pearce]], forced to hand over her baby [[Lexi Pearce]], was criticised by the charity The Who Cares? Trust, who called the storyline an "unhelpful portrayal" and said it had already received calls from members of the public who were "distressed about the ''EastEnders'' scene where a social worker snatches a baby from its mother's arms".<ref name="Fury">{{cite news|url=http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2012/10/09/fury-over-eastenders-misleading-social-work-storyline/|title=Fury over EastEnders' 'misleading' social work storyline|publisher=Community Care|date=9 October 2012|accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref> The scenes were also condemned by the British Association of Social Workers (BASW), calling the BBC "too lazy and arrogant" to correctly portray the child protection process, and saying that the baby was taken "without sufficient grounds to do so". Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked "real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs .. ''EastEnders''{{'}} shabby portrayal of an entire profession has made a tough job even tougher."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/oct/09/eastenders-social-care|title=Social workers outraged by EastEnders storyline about baby Lexi|last=Greenslade|first=Rob|website=The Guardian|date=9 October 2012|accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref>
