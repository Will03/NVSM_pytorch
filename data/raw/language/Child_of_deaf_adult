A '''child of deaf adult''', often known by the acronym "'''coda'''", is a person who was raised by one or more [[deaf]] parents or guardians. Millie Brother coined the term and founded the organization CODA,<ref>Robert Hoffmeister, ''Open Your Eyes: Border Crossings by Hearing Children of Deaf Parents: The Lost History of Codas'' ([[University of Minnesota Press]], 2008), 207.</ref> which serves as a resource and a center of community for children of deaf adults.  Many codas are bilingual, speaking both an oral and a sign language, and bicultural, identifying with both [[Deaf culture|deaf]] and [[Hearing (person)|hearing]] cultures. Codas must navigate the border between the deaf and hearing worlds, serving as liaisons between their deaf parents and the hearing world in which they reside.<ref>Kerri Clark, ''Communication & Parenting Issues in Families with Deaf Parents and Hearing Children'', http://lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/coda.htm, (April 2003)</ref> Ninety percent of children born to deaf adults can hear normally,<ref>Glenn Collins, ''The Family; Children of Deaf Share Their Lives'', https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/15/style/the-family-children-of-deaf-share-their-lives.html, (December 1986).</ref> resulting in a significant and widespread community of codas around the world. The acronym '''koda''' (Kid of Deaf Adult) is sometimes used to refer to codas under the age of 18.

==Potential challenges facing hearing codas==

Hearing codas frequently feel caught between two cultures, in a situation similar to that of many second-generation immigrants. Their parents frequently struggle to communicate in the majority (spoken) language, while codas are usually fluent bilinguals.

This dynamic can lead codas to act as interpreters for their parents, which can be especially problematic when a child coda is asked to interpret messages that are cognitively or emotionally inappropriate for their age. For example, a school-aged child may be called on to explain a diagnosis of a serious medical condition to their deaf parent.

In addition, codas are often exposed to prejudice against their family. Many people may assume that the entire family is deaf because they are all signing. Sometimes such bystanders may make negative comments about the deaf in that family's presence, not realizing the child can hear. Deaf parents may not adequately understand that while a deaf person can look away or close their eyes, a hearing person cannot chose to ignore hurtful words so easily.

Discordant hearing status can also pose practical problems. Deaf and hearing people differ in visual attention patterns, with deaf people being more easily distracted by movement in peripheral vision.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bavelier |first1=D. |last2=Tomann |first2=A. |last3=Hutton |first3=C. |last4=Mitchell |first4=T. |last5=Corina |first5=D. |last6=Liu |first6=G. |last7=Neville |first7=H. |title=Visual Attention to the Periphery Is Enhanced in Congenitally Deaf Individuals |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |date=2000 |volume=20 |issue=17 |pages=RC93–RC93 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.20-17-j0001.2000 |pmid=10952732 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e65e/e2b255d1d936a34b072212cef48efd07d25f.pdf}}</ref> Deaf parents often instinctively use such movement to attract their child's attention, which can lead to difficulties engaging in joint attention with hearing toddlers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Waxman |first1=R.

==Support organizations==
Millie Brother established the organization '''CODA''' ('''Children of Deaf Adults''') in 1983 as a non-profit organization for the hearing sons and daughters of deaf parents.<ref>About CODA, {{cite web |url=http://coda-international.org/blog/about/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529162643/http://coda-international.org/blog/about/ |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }} (2012).</ref> Its first annual conference took place in 1986 in [[Fremont, California]].<ref>[http://coda-international.org/blog/about/events/ CODA events] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817183424/http://coda-international.org/blog/about/events/ |date=August 17, 2010 }}</ref> The conferences have grown and have taken on an international status, with attendees hailing from around the world. CODA aims to raise awareness about the unique experiences and issues of growing up between these two cultures. It provides a forum for CODAs to discuss the shared problems and experiences with other CODAs.<ref>''About CODA'', {{cite web |url=http://coda-international.org/blog/about/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529162643/http://coda-international.org/blog/about/ |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }} (2012).</ref>

Regardless of the spoken and sign languages used, CODA believes that such feelings and experiences that derive from the binary relationship of the two divergent cultures are universally felt by codas. CODA provides educational opportunities, promotes self-help, organizes advocacy efforts, and serves as a resource for codas raised in both signing and non-signing environments.

There are support groups for deaf parents who may be concerned about raising their hearing children, as well as support groups for adult codas. One organization, KODAheart <ref>http://www.kodaheart.org</ref> provides educational and recreational resources for deaf parents and hearing children through an educational website and pop-up camps. Several camps have been established for KODAs:
* Camp Mark Seven, which was established as the first KODA camp in 1998. They have two two-week programs for campers from 9 to 16 years old. 
* Camp Grizzly,<ref>[http://www.norcalcenter.org/?page=otherprograms&other_page=campgrizzly NorCal &#124; Services for Deaf & Hard of Hearing, Inc]</ref> which hosts a one-week program for preteen and teen codas
* KODAWest, which is a week-long camp in Southern California held annually in the summer for campers from ages 8 to 15, Counselors-in-training (CIT) from ages 16 to 17, and Counselors from ages 18 and older.
* KODA MidWest, which is held in Wisconsin and has several sessions ranging from 7 – 16 years old, Counselors-in-training (CIT) at age 17, and Counselors ages 18 and older. This camp offers three sessions a summer with substantial variety in campers' ages and is often fully enrolled each session.<ref>https://kodacamp.wordpress.com</ref>

There is also CODA UK & Ireland.
