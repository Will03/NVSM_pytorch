Language can be artistic to the extent that artists use it as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world.<ref>(nl) Lies Daenen, ''[http://bamart.be/nl/pages/detail/10884 De (on)macht van taal.

Unlike [[engineered language]]s or [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary language]]s, artistic languages often have irregular grammar systems, much like natural [[language]]s.  Many are designed within the context of [[fictional world]]s, such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]].  Others can represent fictional languages in a world not patently different from the real world, or have no particular fictional background attached.

There are several different [[Schools of thought|schools]] of artlang construction. The most prominent is the '''naturalist''' school, which seeks to imitate the complexity and historicity of natural languages. Others typically follow a more abstract style, as the intent behind their construction differs. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

==Genres==

Several different genres of constructed languages are classified as 'artistic'. An artistic language may fall into any one of the following groups, depending on the aim of its use.
Similarly to [[philosophical language]]s, artlangs are created in accordance with an initially defined principle in mind.

=== Fictional languages ===

{{main|Fictional language}}

By far the largest group of artlangs are '''fictional languages''' (sometimes also referred to as "professional artlangs"). Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world, and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated. By analogy with the word "conlang", the term ''[[conworld]]'' is used to describe these worlds, inhabited by fictional [[constructed culture]]s.

There are two major categories of fictional languages.

'''Professional fictional languages''' are those languages created for use in books, movies, television shows, video games, comics, toys, and songs. Prominent examples of works featuring fictional languages include the [[Middle-earth]] and ''[[Star Trek]]'' universes, the game [[Ico]] and the songs of the French band [[Magma (band)|Magma]], singing in Kobaïan.

'''Internet-based fictional languages''' are hosted along with their "conworlds" on the Internet, and based at these sites, becoming known to the world through the visitors to these sites. An example is  [[Verdurian]], the language of [[Mark Rosenfelder]]'s Verduria on the planet of Almea.

=== Alternative languages ===

'''Alternative languages''', or ''altlangs'', speculate on an alternate history and try to reconstruct how a family of natural languages would have evolved if things had been different: e.g., What if Greek civilization had gone on to thrive without a Roman Empire, leaving [[Greek language|Greek]] and not [[Latin]] to develop several modern descendants? The language that ''would have'' evolved is then traced step by step in its evolution, to reach its modern form. An altlang will typically base itself on the core vocabulary of one language and the phonology of another. The best-known language of this category is [[Brithenig]], which initiated the interest among Internet conlangers in devising such alternate-historical languages, like [[Wenedyk]]. Brithenig attempts to determine how Romance languages would have evolved had Roman influence in Britain been sufficient to replace Celtic languages with [[Vulgar Latin]], and bases its phonology on that of [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. An earlier instance is [[Philip José Farmer]]'s [[Winkie language]], a relative of the [[Germanic languages]] spoken by the Winkies of Oz in ''A Barnstormer in Oz''. Another example is [[Linguistic purism in English|Anglish]], which tries to reconstruct how English could have looked  without Latin influence.

=== Micronational languages ===

'''Micronational languages''' are the languages created for use in [[micronation]]s. Having the citizens learn the language is as much a part of participating in the micronation as minting coins and stamps or participating in government. The members of these micronations meet up and speak the language they have learned when they are participating in these meets. They coin new words and grammatical constructions when needed. [[Talossan language|Talossan]], from R. Ben Madison's [[Talossa|Kingdom of Talossa]], is by far the best-known example of a micronational language.

=== Personal languages ===

'''Personal languages''' are ultimately created for one's own edification. The creator does not expect anyone to speak it; the language exists as a work of art. A personal language may be invented for the purpose of having a beautiful language, for self-expression, as an exercise in understanding linguistic principles, or perhaps as an attempt to create a language with an extreme phonemic inventory or system of verbs. Personal languages tend to have short lifespans, and are often displayed on the Internet and discussed on message boards much like Internet-based fictional languages. They are often invented in large numbers by the people who design these languages.  However, a few personal languages are used extensively and long-term by their creators (e.g., for writing [[Diary|diaries]]).  Javant Biarujia, the creator of [[Taneraic]], described his personal language (which he terms a '''hermetic language''') thus: "a private pact negotiated between the world at large and the world within me; public words simply could not guarantee me the private expression I sought."<ref>[http://www.phreacs.com.au/tanerai/ Taneraic on the Web]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050731075734/http://www.phreacs.com.au/tanerai/ |date=July 31, 2005 }}</ref>  The author [[Robert Dessaix]] describes the origins of his personal language K: "I wanted words that described reality. So I made them up."<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/ling/stories/s693291.htm "The Language of K"], ''Lingua Franca'', 19 December 1998  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527161927/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/ling/stories/s693291.htm |date=May 27, 2006 }}</ref>

=== Micro languages ===

The aim of some languages is to express deep meaning with very few parts. For instance, [[Toki Pona]]<ref>[http://en.tokipona.org/wiki/What_is_Toki_Pona%3F What is Toki Pona?]  {{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> is based on just 123 words and 14 'sounds'. The creator, Sonja Lang, says that the principles are built on [[Taoism]]. Another language composed along the same lines is  Papisa-samama<ref>http://papisa-samana.yolasite.com/{{Password-protected}}</ref> which utilises just six consonants and two vowels, has just 12 syllables, making just a 120 word lexicon. It can be read in its own Chinese-like written form or in a [[pinyin]]-like, romanised form. Unlike Toki Pona, it has a complex number system based on Roman numerals. Both Toki Pona and Papisa-samama have a small root-word vocabulary and rely heavily on compound nouns, for instance, in Papisa-samama, ''enlightenment'' might be translated as ''patima-tasama-simi'', that is, ''deep-thought-light.''

=== Jokelangs ===
{{see also|Language game}}
The term '''jokelang''' is sometimes applied to conlangs created as jokes. These may be languages intended primarily to sound funny, such as [http://www.dilingo.net/ DiLingo], or for some type of [[satire]], often as satire on some aspect of constructed languages.

Some typical jokelangs are:
* [[Europanto]] – an unstructured mixture of European languages
* [[Transpiranto]] – constructed from international words inflected to sound like Swedish jargon, in order to improve malplacedness and ambiguity
* Oou – a deliberately ambiguous and [[polysemous]] language whose writing system is made up entirely of punctuation marks and whose [[phoneme]] inventory is made up entirely of vowels
* DiLingo – a rhyming language that contains much humor, both superficial and cleverly sneaky
* [[:es:Gulevache|Gulevache]] – a fictional joke romance language created by the Argentinian comedy-musical group [[Les Luthiers]] for its opera [[Cardoso en Gulevandia]]
* Unwinese – the nonsensical but structured alternative English, also known as [[gobbledygook]] but named by its creator Basic Engly Twentyfimode, used by comedian [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]]
* Inflationary Language – invented by comedian [[Victor Borge]], incrementing numbers embedded in words, e.g., ''crenine'' ("create") and ''elevennis'' ("tennis")

===Experimental languages===

{{main|Experimental languages}}

An experimental language is a [[constructed language]] designed for the purpose of exploring some theory of [[linguistics]]. Most such languages are concerned with the relation between [[language and thought]]; however, languages have been constructed to explore other aspects of language as well. In [[science fiction]], much work has been done on the assumption popularly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]. Artlangs of this type overlap with [[engineered language]]s.
