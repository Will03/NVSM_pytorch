In [[mythology]], [[medieval literature]] and [[occult]]ism, the '''language of the birds''' is postulated as a mystical, perfect [[divine language]], [[language of the birds#Alchemy|green language]], [[adamic language]], [[Enochian]], [[Angel|angelic language]] or a [[Mythical origins of language|mythical]] or magical language used by [[bird]]s to communicate with the initiated.

==History==
In [[Indo-European religion]], the behavior of birds has long been used for the purposes of [[divination]] by [[augur]]s. According to a suggestion by [[Walter Burkert]], these customs may have their roots in the [[Paleolithic]] when, during the [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]], early humans looked for [[carrion]] by observing scavenging birds.<ref>{{cite book |title=In the Company of Crows and Ravens |last=Marzluff |first=John M. |author2=Tony Angell  |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven and London |isbn=0-300-12255-1 |pages=284–287}}</ref>

There are also examples of contemporary bird-human communication and [[symbiosis]]. In North America, ravens have been known to lead wolves (and native hunters) to prey they otherwise would be unable to consume.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Tracks and Scats |last=McDougall |first=Len |year=2004 |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=1-59228-070-6 |page=296 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://fwp.mt.gov/news/newsReleases/headlines/nr_1762.html |title=Raven Myths May Be Real |accessdate=2017-10-29 |last=Tipton |first=Diane |date=2006-07-06 |publisher=Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks}}</ref>  In Africa, the [[greater honeyguide]] is known to guide humans to beehives in the hope that the hive will be incapacitated and opened for them.

Dating to the [[Renaissance]], birdsong was the inspiration for some [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al [[engineered language]]s, in particular [[musical language]]s. [[Whistled language]]s based on spoken natural languages are also sometimes referred to as the language of the birds. Some [[language games]] are also referred to as the language of birds, such as in [[Oromo language|Oromo]] and [[Amharic]] of Ethiopia.<ref>Kebbede Hordofa and Peter Unseth. 1986. "Bird Talk" in Oromo. ''Quaderni di Studi Etiopici'' 6-7:74-83</ref>

Ukrainian language is known as "nightingale speech" amongst its speakers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Mythology===

====Norse mythology====
In [[Norse mythology]], the power to understand the language of the birds was a sign of great wisdom. The god [[Odin]] had two ravens, called [[Hugin and Munin]], who flew around the world and told Odin what happened among mortal men.

The legendary [[king of Sweden]] [[Dag the Wise]] was so wise that he could understand what birds said. He had a tame [[house sparrow]] which flew around and brought back news to him. Once, a farmer in [[Reidgotaland]] killed Dag's sparrow, which brought on a terrible retribution from the Swedes.

In the ''[[Rígsþula]]'', Konr was able to understand the speech of birds. When Konr was riding through the forest hunting and snaring birds, a crow spoke to him and suggested he would win more if he stopped hunting mere birds and rode to battle against foemen.

The ability could also be acquired by tasting dragon blood. According to the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'', [[Sigurd]] accidentally tasted dragon blood while roasting the heart of [[Fafnir]]. This gave him the ability to understand the language of birds, and his life was saved as the birds were discussing [[Regin]]'s plans to kill Sigurd. Through the same ability [[Áslaug]], Sigurd's daughter, found out the betrothment of her husband [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], to another woman.

[[File:Sigurd.svg|thumb|240px|right|The 11th century Ramsund carving in Sweden depicts how [[Sigurd]] learnt the language of birds, in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the [[Völsunga saga]]]]
The 11th century [[Ramsund carving]] in [[Sweden]] depicts how [[Sigurd]] learnt the language of birds, in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Völsunga saga]]''.
# Sigurd is sitting naked in front of the fire preparing the dragon heart, from [[Fafnir]], for his foster-father [[Regin]], who is [[Fafnir]]'s brother. The heart is not finished yet, and when Sigurd touches it, he burns himself and sticks his finger into his mouth. As he has tasted dragon blood, he starts to understand the birds' song.
# The birds say that Regin will not keep his promise of reconciliation and will try to kill Sigurd, which causes Sigurd to cut off Regin's head.
# Regin is dead beside his own head, his smithing tools with which he reforged Sigurd's sword [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] are scattered around him, and
# Regin's horse is laden with the dragon's treasure.
# is the previous event when Sigurd killed Fafnir, and
# shows [[Ótr]] from the saga's beginning.

In an [[Poetic Edda|eddic poem]] loosely connected with the Sigurd tradition which is named ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'', the reason why a man named Atli once had the ability is not explained. Atli's lord's son Helgi would marry what was presumably Sigurd's aunt, the [[Valkyrie]] [[Sváfa]].

====Greek mythology====
According to [[Apollonius Rhodius]], the [[figurehead]] of [[Jason]]'s ship, the ''[[Argo]]'', was built of [[oak]] from the sacred grove at [[Dodona]] and could speak the language of birds. [[Tiresias]] was also said to have been given the ability to understand the language of the birds by [[Athena]]. The language of birds in [[Greek mythology]] may be attained by magical means. [[Democritus]], [[Anaximander]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], [[Melampus]] and [[Aesopus]] were all said to have understood the birds.

The 'birds' are also mentioned in [[Homer]]'s Odyssey : "“[...] although I am no prophet really, and I do not know much about the meaning of birds. I tell you he will not long be absent from his dear native land, not if chains of iron hold him fast. He will find a way to get back, for he is never at a loss."<ref>The Odyssey - Chapter 1 - What Went On in the House of Odysseus</ref>

===Middle Eastern folklore===
In the [[Quran]], Suleiman ([[Solomon]]) and [[David]] are said to have been taught the language of the birds.<ref>27:16 "And Solomon inherited David. He said, "O people, we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from all things. Indeed, this is evident bounty."</ref> Within [[Sufism]], the language of birds is a mystical [[divine language]]. ''[[The Conference of the Birds]]'' is a mystical poem of 4647 verses by the 12th century [[Persian literature|Persian]] poet [[Attar of Nishapur]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/safa/ho_63.210.67.htm METmuseum.org]</ref>

In the [[Jerusalem Talmud]],<ref>[[Louis Ginzberg]], ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', 1909</ref> [[Solomon]]'s proverbial wisdom was due to his being granted understanding of the language of birds by God.

In Egyptian Arabic, [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] is called "the alphabet of the birds".{{cn|date=November 2016}}

===Folklore===
The concept is also known from many [[Folklore|folk tale]]s (including Welsh, Russian, German, Estonian, Greek, Romany),  where usually the protagonist is granted the gift of understanding the language of the birds either by some magical transformation, or as a [[wikt:boon|boon]] by the king of birds. The birds then inform or warn the hero about some danger or hidden treasure. One example is the Russian story [[The Language of the Birds]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Alchemy===
In [[Kabbalah]], [[Renaissance magic|Renaissance]] [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[alchemy]], the language of the birds was considered a secret and perfect language and the key to perfect knowledge, sometimes also called the ''langue verte'', or green language ([[Jean Julien Fulcanelli]], [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]  ''[[De occulta philosophia libri tres|de occulta philosophia]]'', ([[Emmanuel-Yves Monin]], ''[[Hieroglyphes Français Et Langue Des Oiseaux)]]'', {{cn|date=November 2016}}

===Literature and culture===
Compare also the rather comical and satirical ''[[The Birds (play)|Birds]]'' of [[Aristophanes]] and ''[[Parlement of Foules|Parliament of Fowls]]'' by [[Chaucer]].

In medieval [[France]], the language of the birds (''la langue des oiseaux'') was a secret language of the [[Troubadour]]s, connected with the [[Tarot]], allegedly based on puns and symbolism drawn from homophony, e. g. an inn called  ''au lion d'or'' ("the Golden Lion") is allegedly "code" for ''au lit on dort'' "in the bed one sleeps".<ref>[http://letarot.com/dossiers-chauds/langue-des-oiseaux/ Letarot.com]</ref>

[[René Guénon]] has written an article about the symbolism of the language of the birds.<ref>René Guénon - Symbols of Sacred Science, Chapter 9 - The Language of birds</ref>

Chinese writer [[Pu Songling]] wrote about "[[The Bird Language]]" in his anthology ''[[Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio]]".
