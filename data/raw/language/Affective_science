'''Affective science''' is the scientific study of [[emotion]] or [[Affect (psychology)|affect]]. This includes the study of emotion elicitation, emotional experience and the recognition of emotions in others. In particular the nature of feeling, [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], emotionally driven behaviour, decision making, attention and self-regulation, as well as the underlying [[physiology]] and [[neuroscience]] of the emotions.

==Discussion==
An increasing interest in emotion can be seen in the behavioral, biological and social sciences. Research over the last two decades suggests that many phenomena, ranging from individual [[cognitive process]]ing to social and [[collective behavior]], cannot be understood without taking into account affective determinants (i.e. motives, attitudes, moods, and emotions).<ref>[http://www.affective-sciences.org/affective-sciences The National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) for the Affective Sciences] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503010907/http://www.affective-sciences.org/affective-sciences |date=May 3, 2008 }} See also [[Swiss Center for Affective Sciences]]; Seidner identified a negative affect arousal mechanism regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins. See Stanley S. Seidner [1991] ''Negative Affect Arousal Reactions from Mexican and Puerto Rican Respondents'' http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED346711&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED346711</ref> Just as the [[cognitive revolution]] of the 1960s spawned the [[cognitive science]]s and linked the disciplines studying cognitive functioning from different vantage points, the emerging field of affective science seeks to bring together the disciplines which study the biological, psychological, and social dimensions of affect. In particular affective science includes [[psychology]], [[affective neuroscience|neuroscience]], [[sociology]], [[psychiatry]], [[anthropology]], [[ethology]], [[archaeology]], [[economics]], [[criminology]], [[law]], [[political science]], [[history]], [[geography]], [[education]] and [[linguistics]]. Research is also informed by contemporary philosophical analysis and artistic explorations of emotions. Emotions developed in human history make organisms to react to environmental stimuli and challenges.<ref>Ann M.Kring and Erin K.Moran. Emotional Response Deficits in Schizophrenia: Insights From Affective Science. (2008)</ref>

The major challenge for this interdisciplinary domain is to integrate research focusing on the same phenomenon, emotion and similar affective processes, starting from different perspectives, theoretical backgrounds, and levels of analysis. As a result, one of the first challenges of affective science is to reach consensus on the definition of emotions. Discussion is ongoing as to whether emotions are primarily bodily responses or whether cognitive processing is central. Controversy also concerns the most effective ways to measure emotions and conceptualise how one emotion differs from another. Examples of this include the dimensional models of Russell and others, [[Plutchik's wheel of emotions]], and the general distinction between basic and complex emotions.<ref name="affective-science">{{cite web|url=http://www.affective-science.org/research.shtml |title=Research - Lisa Feldman Barrett - Interdisciplinary Affective Science Laboratory - Northeastern University|publisher=affective-science.org|accessdate=2016-07-27}}</ref>

==Measuring emotions==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
Whether scientific method is at all suited for the study of the subjective aspect of emotion, [[feeling]]s, is a question for [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]]. In practice, the use of self-report (i.e. questionnaires) has been widely adopted by researchers. Additionally, web-based research is being used to conduct large-scale studies on the components of happiness for example. (www.authentichappiness.com is a website run by the University of Pennsylvania, where questionnaires are routinely taken by thousands of people all over the world based on a well-being criteria devised in the book 'Flourish.' by Martin Seligman.<ref name="theguardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/may/15/flourish-science-of-happiness-psychology-review|title=Flourish: A New Understanding of Happiness and Well-Being — and How to Achieve Them by Martin Seligman — review &#124; Science &#124; The Guardian|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=2016-07-27}}</ref>) Nevertheless, Seligman mentions in the book the poor reliability of using this method as it is often entirely subjective to how the individual is feeling at the time, as opposed to questionnaires which test for more long standing personal features that contribute to well-being such as meaning in life. Alongside this researchers also use [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] and physiological measures of skin conductance, muscle tension and hormone secretion. This hybrid approach should allow researchers to gradually pinpoint the affective phenomenon. There are also a few commercial systems available that claim to measure emotions, for instance using automated video analysis (nViso) or skin conductance ([[Affectiva]]).

===Affective display===
{{Main article|Affect display}}

A common way to measure the emotions of others is via their emotional expressions. These include [[facial expression]], vocal expression and bodily posture. Much work has also gone into coding expressive behaviour  computer programmes that can be used to read the subject's emotion more reliably. The model used for facial expression is the [[Facial Action Coding System]] or 'FACS'. An influential figure in the development of this system was [[Paul Ekman]]. For criticism, see the [[conceptual-act model of emotion]].

These behavioural sources can be contrasted with language descriptive of emotions. In both respects one may observe the way that affective display differs from culture to culture.

==At Stanford ==
The Stanford University Psychology Department has an Affective Science area. It emphasizes basic research on emotion, culture, and psychopathology using a broad range of experimental, psychophysiological, neural, and genetic methods to test theory about psychological mechanisms underlying human behavior. Topics include longevity, culture and emotion, reward processing, depression, social anxiety, risk for psychopathology, and emotion expression, suppression, and (dys)regulation.<ref name="stanford">{{cite web|url=http://psychology.stanford.edu/node/2023|title=Affective Science &#124; Department of Psychology|publisher=psychology.stanford.edu|accessdate=2016-07-27}}</ref>
