=== In comedy ===
Similes are used extensively in British comedy, notably in the [[slapstick]] era of the 1960s and 1970s. In comedy, the simile is often used in negative style: "he was as daft as a brush." They are also used in comedic context where a sensitive subject is broached, and the comedian will test the audience with response to a subtle implicit simile before going deeper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.funnysimiles.com/what_is_a_simile.html|title=What Is A Simile?|last=|first=|website=Funny Similes!|access-date=2016-04-06}}</ref> The sitcom ''[[Blackadder]]'' featured the use of extended similes, normally said by the title character.

== In languages other than English ==

Given that similes emphasize affinities between different objects, they occur in many cultures and languages. 

=== Arabic ===
[[Sayf al-Din al-Amidi]] discussed Arabic similes in 1805: [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2981 "On Substantiation Through Transitive Relations"].

=== Vietnamese ===

Thuy Nga Nguyen and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] (2012) classify Vietnamese similes into two types: Meaning Similes and Rhyming Similes. 

The following is an example:
<br>
<br>'''Nghèo''' như con '''mèo'''
<br>/'''ŋɛu''' ɲɯ kɔn '''mɛu'''/ 
<br>"Poor as a cat"
<br>

Whereas the above Vietnamese example is of a '''rhyming''' simile, the English simile "(as) poor as a church mouse" is only a '''semantic''' simile.<ref>See p. 98 in Thuy Nga Nguyen and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] (2012), "Stupid as a Coin: Meaning and Rhyming Similes in Vietnamese", ''International Journal of Language Studies'' 6 (4), pp. 97-118.</ref>
