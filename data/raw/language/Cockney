The term '''''cockney''''' has had several distinct geographical, social, and linguistic associations. Originally a pejorative term applied to all city-dwellers, it was gradually restricted to [[London]]ers, and particularly to "Bow-bell Cockneys":<ref name=phrase/> those born within earshot of Bow Bells, the [[church bells|bells]] of [[St Mary-le-Bow]]<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cockney|volume=6|page=627}}</ref> in the [[Cheapside]] district of the [[City of London]]. It eventually came to be used to refer to those in London's [[East End of London|East End]], or to all working-class Londoners generally.<ref>Green, Jonathon [http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-use/cockney/ "Cockney"].

[[#Speech|Cockney English]] is the accent or dialect of English traditionally spoken by working-class Londoners. In the 1980s, some features of cockney became more frequent in broadcasting, and the media began to speak of a new standard called [[Estuary English]], but most linguists rejected this analysis and the term is less frequently used now.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/ee-faqs-jcw.htm |title=Estuary English Q and A - JCW |publisher=Phon.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Roach|first1=Peter|title=English Phonetics and Phonology|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-71740-3|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{citation

The earliest recorded use of the term is 1362 in passus VI of [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', where it is used to mean "a small, misshapen [[egg (food)|egg]]", from [[Middle English]] ''coken'' + ''ey'' ("a [[rooster|cock]]'s egg").<ref name="oxoed">{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1989 |edition=Second |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50042885?query_type=word&queryword=cockney&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=GFml-T85glP-13801&hilite=50042885 |accessdate=24 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622035837/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50042885?query_type=word&queryword=cockney&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=GFml-T85glP-13801&hilite=50042885 |archivedate=22 June 2011 }}</ref> Concurrently, the [[List of mythological places|mythical land]] of luxury [[Cockaigne]] ([[Attested language|attested]] from 1305) appeared under a variety of spellings—including Cockayne, Cocknay, and Cockney—and became humorously associated with the [[Kingdom of England|English]] capital [[London]].<ref name="hott">{{cite book|last=Hotten|first=John Camden|title=[[A dictionary of modern slang, cant and vulgar words]]|page=22|chapter=Cockney|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zhk9h-w1negC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dictionary+of+Modern+Slang,+Cant+and+Vulgar+Words&cd=1#v=onepage&q=|year=1859}}
'''Cockney''': a native of London. An ancient nickname implying effeminacy, used by the oldest English writers, and derived from the imaginary fool's paradise, or lubberland, ''Cockaygne''.</ref>{{refn|Note, however, that the earliest attestation of this particular usage provided by the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is from 1824 and consists of a tongue-in-cheek allusion to an existing notion of "Cockneydom".<ref name="oedcockaigne">{{cite book|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|title=Oxford English Dictionary|year=2009 |edition=Second|accessdate=3 July 2006}}</ref>}}

The present meaning of cockney comes from its use among rural Englishmen (attested in 1520) as a pejorative term for effeminate town-dwellers,{{refn|"This cokneys and tytyllynges...

The region in which cockneys are thought to reside is not clearly defined. A common view is that in order to be a cockney, one must have been born within earshot of [[Bow Bells]], the bells of [[St Mary-le-Bow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarylebow.co.uk/#/bow-bells/4535373284|title=St Mary-le-Bow|website=www.stmarylebow.co.uk}}</ref> However, the church of St Mary-le-Bow was destroyed in 1666 by the [[Great Fire of London]] and rebuilt by [[Sir Christopher Wren]]. Although the bells were destroyed again in 1941 in [[the Blitz]], they had fallen silent on 13 June 1940 as part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II]]. Before they were replaced in 1961, there was a period when, by the "within earshot" definition, no "Bow Bell" cockneys could be born.<ref>J. Swinnerton, ''The London Companion'' (Robson, 2004), p. 21.</ref> The use of such a literal definition produces other problems, since the area around the church is no longer residential and the noise of the area makes it unlikely that many people would now be born within earshot of the bells,{{sfnp|Wright|1981|p=11}} although the [[Royal London Hospital]], [[Guy's Hospital]], [[General_Lying-In_Hospital|Lying-In Hospital]] and [[St Thomas' Hospital]] are within the defined area covered by the sound of the Bow Bells. The closest maternity units would be the City of London Maternity Hospital, [[Finsbury Square]], but this hospital was bombed out during the [[World War II]] Blitz, and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] (or Barts), whose maternity department closed in the late 1980s. The East London Maternity Hospital in Stepney, which was 2.5 miles from St Mary-le-Bow, was in use from 1884 to 1968. There is a maternity unit still in use at the Royal London Hospital in [[Whitechapel]]. Home births were very common until the late 1960s.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

A study was carried out by the [[City of London|City]] in 2000 to see how far away Bow Bells could be heard,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-use/cockney/|title=Cockney - Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> and it was estimated that the bells would have been heard up to six miles to the east, five miles to the north, three miles to the south, and four miles to the west. According to the legend of [[Dick Whittington]] the bells could once be heard from as far away as the Highgate [[Archway, London|Archway]] (4.5 miles north). The association of cockneys with the East End in the public imagination may be due to many people assuming that Bow Bells are to be found in the district of [[Bow, London|Bow]], rather than the lesser known St Mary-le-Bow church in [[Cheapside]] in the [[City of London]]. Thus while all East Enders are cockneys, not all cockneys are East Enders.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

The traditional core districts of the [[East End of London|East End]] are [[Bethnal Green]], [[Whitechapel]], [[Spitalfields]], [[Stepney]], [[Wapping]], [[Limehouse]], [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], [[Clerkenwell]], [[Aldgate]], [[Shoreditch]], [[Millwall]], [[Cubitt Town]], [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], [[Hoxton]], [[Bow, London|Bow]] and [[Mile End]]. "The Borough" to the south of Waterloo, London and Tower Bridge were also considered cockney before redevelopment all but extinguished the local working-class areas, and now [[Bermondsey]] is the only cockney area south of the [[River Thames]], although [[Pearly Kings and Queens]] can be found as far out as [[Peckham]] and [[Penge]]. The area north of the Thames gradually expanded to include [[East Ham]], [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], [[West Ham]] and [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]] as more land was built upon. The [[Becontree]] estate near Dagenham in Essex was built by the [[Corporation of London]] to house poor residents of London's East End on what was previously a rural area of Essex, and Peter Wright wrote that most of the residents identified as cockneys rather than as Essex folk.{{sfnp|Wright|1981|p=146}}

==Migration and evolution==
A dialectological study of [[Leytonstone]] in 1964 (then in Essex) found that the area's dialect was very similar to that recorded in Bethnal Green by Eva Sivertsen but there were still some features that distinguished Leytonstone speech from cockney.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Werth |first=P.N. |date=1965 |title=The Dialect of Leytonstone, East London |type=Bachelor |page=16 |publisher=University of Leeds |url=https://explore.library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/410290/the_dialect_of_leytonstone_east_london }}</ref>

Linguistic research conducted in the early 2010s suggests that today, certain elements of cockney English are declining in usage within the [[East End of London]] and the accent has migrated to [[Outer London]] and the [[Home Counties]]. In London's East End, some traditional features of cockney have been displaced by a [[Jamaican Creole]]-influenced variety popular among young Londoners (sometimes referred to as "[[Jafaican]]"), particularly, though far from exclusively, those of [[British African-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] descent.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10473059 |title=Cockney to disappear from London 'within 30 years' |work=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=1 October 2010 |date=1 July 2010}}</ref> Nevertheless, the [[glottal stop]], double negatives, and the [[L-vocalisation|vocalisation of the dark L]] (and other features of cockney speech), along with some [[rhyming slang]] terms are still in common usage.

An influential July 2010 report by Paul Kerswill, Professor of Sociolinguistics at Lancaster University, ''[[Multicultural London English]]: the emergence, acquisition and diffusion of a new variety'', predicted that the cockney accent will disappear from London's streets within 30 years.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The study, funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], said that the accent, which has been around for more than 500 years, is being replaced in London by a new hybrid language. "Cockney in the East End is now transforming itself into Multicultural London English, a new, [[English in southern England#Multicultural London English|melting-pot mixture]] of all those people living here who learnt English as a second language", Prof Kerswill said.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Conversely, migration of cockney speakers has led to migration of the dialect. In [[Essex]], planned towns that grew [[New towns in the United Kingdom|from post-war migration out of London]] (e.g. [[Basildon]] and [[Harlow]]) often have a strong cockney influence on local speech. However, this is, except where least mixed, difficult to discern because of common features: linguistic historian and researcher of early dialects [[Alexander John Ellis]] in 1890 stated that cockney developed owing to the influence of Essex dialect on London speech.{{sfnp|Ellis|1890|pp=35, 57, 58}} 

The dialect eventually moved out of inner-city London towards the outskirts of suburban London and into the [[Home Counties]] - in particular the [[London Borough of Havering]] and throughout [[Essex]] county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romfordrecorder.co.uk/news/forget-tower-hamlets-romford-is-new-east-end-says-cockney-language-study-1-2314662|title=Forget Tower Hamlets - Romford is new East End, says Cockney language study|first=Ramzy|last=Alwakeel|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/heritage/cockney-dialect-migrated-to-essex-dr-fox-tells-east-end-cockney-festival-1-2298684|title=Cockney dialect migrated to Essex, Dr Fox tells East End Cockney Festival|first=Mike|last=Brooke|publisher=}}</ref> Today Cockney-speaking areas include parts of [[Ilford]], [[Dagenham]], [[Barking, London|Barking]], [[Billericay]], [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]], [[Romford]], [[Chigwell]], [[Cheshunt]], [[Brimsdown]], [[Loughton]], [[Harlow]], [[Basildon]], [[Thurrock]].{{fact|date=April 2017}}

John Camden Hotten, in his ''Slang Dictionary'' of 1859, makes reference to "their use of a peculiar slang language" when describing the [[costermonger]]s of London's East End. In terms of other slang, there are also several borrowings from [[Yiddish]], including ''kosher'' (originally Hebrew, via Yiddish, meaning ''legitimate'') and ''stumm'' ({{IPA|/ʃtʊm/}} originally German, via Yiddish, meaning ''quiet''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-shtumm.html |title=Definition of shtumm |publisher=Allwords.com |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> as well as [[Romani language|Romany]], for example ''wonga'' (meaning ''money'', from the Romany "wanga" meaning coal),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballs.com/moneyslanghistory.htm |title=money slang history, words, expressions and money slang meanings, london cockney money slang words meanings expressions |publisher=Businessballs.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> and ''cushty'' (Kushty) (from the Romany ''kushtipen'', meaning good). A fake cockney accent is sometimes called [[mockney]].

*As with many accents of the United Kingdom, cockney is [[non-rhotic]]. A final ''-er'' is pronounced {{IPAblink|ə}} or lowered {{IPAblink|ɐ}} in broad cockney.

"Clapham" can be said as ''Cla'am'' (i. e., {{IPA|[ˈkl̥ɛʔm̩]}}).{{sfnp|Wright|1981|pp=136–137}} {{IPA|/t/}} may also be [[flapping|flapped]] intervocalically, e.g. ''utter'' {{IPA|[ˈɐɾə]}}. London {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are often aspirated in intervocalic and final environments, e.g., ''upper'' {{IPA|[ˈɐpʰə]}}, ''utter'' {{IPA|[ˈɐtʰə]}}, ''rocker'' {{IPA|[ˈɹɒkʰə]}}, ''up'' {{IPA|[ɐʔpʰ]}}, ''out'' {{IPA|[æə̯ʔtʰ]}}, ''rock'' {{IPA|[ɹɒʔkʰ]}}, where [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] is traditionally described as having the unaspirated variants. Also, in broad cockney at least, the degree of aspiration is typically greater than in RP, and may often also involve some degree of affrication {{IPA|[pᶲʰ, tˢʰ, kˣʰ]}}. Affricatives may be encountered in initial, intervocalic, and final position.{{sfnp|Sivertsen|1960|p=109}}{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=323}}
**This feature results in cockney being often mentioned in textbooks about [[Semitic language]]s while explaining how to pronounce the [[glottal stop]].

*The [[alveolar stop]]s {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} are often omitted in informal cockney, in non-prevocalic environments, including some that cannot be omitted in Received Pronunciation. Examples include {{IPA|[ˈdæzɡənə]}} ''Dad's gonna'' and {{IPA|[ˈtɜːn ˈlef]}} ''turn left''.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=327}}
*[[H-dropping|''H''-dropping]].

*Diphthong alterations:{{sfnp|Hughes|Trudgill|1979|pp=39–41}}
** {{IPA|/iː/}} → {{IPA|[əi~ɐi]}}:{{sfnp|Matthews|1938|p=78}}{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=306}} {{IPA|[bəiʔ]}} "beet"
** {{IPA|/eɪ/}} → {{IPA|[æɪ~aɪ]}}:{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=307–308}} {{IPA|[bæɪʔ]}} "bait"
** {{IPA|/aɪ/}} → {{IPA|[ɑɪ]}} or even {{IPA|[ɒɪ]}} in "vigorous, dialectal" cockney. The second element may be reduced or absent (with compensatory lengthening of the first element), so that there are variants such as {{IPA|[ɑ̟ə~{{IPA link|ɑ|ɑ̟ː}}]}}. This means that pairs such as ''laugh''-''life'', ''Barton''-''biting'' may become homophones: {{IPA|[lɑːf]}}, {{IPA|[bɑːʔn̩]}}. But this neutralisation is an optional, recoverable one:{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=308, 310}} {{IPA|[bɑɪʔ]}} "bite"
** {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}} → {{IPA|[ɔ̝ɪ~oɪ]}}:{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=308, 310}} {{IPA|[ˈtʃʰoɪs]}} "choice"
** {{IPA|/uː/}} → {{IPA|[əʉ]}} or a monophthongal {{IPA|[ʉː]}}, perhaps with little lip rounding, {{IPA|[ɨː]}} or {{IPA|[ʊː]}}:{{sfnp|Matthews|1938|p=78}}{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=306–307}} {{IPA|[bʉːʔ]}} "boot"
** {{IPA|/əʊ/}} → this diphthong typically starts in the area of the London {{IPA|/ʌ/}}, {{IPA|[{{IPA link|æ|æ̈}}~{{IPA link|ɐ}}]}}. The endpoint may be {{IPAblink|ʊ}}, but more commonly it is rather opener and/or completely unrounded, i.e. {{IPAblink|ɤ|ɤ̈}} or {{IPAblink|ɯ̽|ɤ̝̈}}. Thus, the most common variants are {{IPA|[æ̈ɤ̈, æ̈ɤ̝̈, ɐɤ̈]}} and {{IPA|[ɐɤ̝̈]}}, with {{IPA|[æ̈ʊ]}} and {{IPA|[ɐʊ]}} also being possible. The broadest cockney variant approaches {{IPA|[aʊ]}}. There's also a variant that is used only by women, namely {{IPA|[ɐø ~ œ̈ø]}}. In addition, there are two monophthongal pronunciations, {{IPAblink|ʌ|ʌ̈ː}} as in 'no, nah' and {{IPAblink|œ|œ̈}}, which is used in non-prominent variants.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=308–310}} {{IPA|[kʰɐɤ̈ʔ]}} "coat"
** {{IPA|/ɪə/}} and {{IPA|/eə/}} have somewhat tenser onsets than in RP: {{IPA|[iə]}}, {{IPA|[ɛ̝ə]}}{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=305}}{{sfnp|Mott|2012|p=77}}
** {{IPA|/ʊə/}}, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982}}, is being increasingly merged with {{IPA|/ɔː/}} ~ {{IPA|/ɔə/}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=305}}
** {{IPA|/aʊ/}} may be {{IPA|[æʊ]}}{{sfnp|Mott|2012|p=77}} or {{IPA|[æə]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=305, 309}}
** {{IPA|/ɪə/}}, {{IPA|/eə/}}, {{IPA|/ʊə/}}, {{IPA|/ɔə/}} and {{IPA|/aʊ/}} can be monophthongised to {{IPAblink|ɪː}}, {{IPAblink|ɛː}}, {{IPAblink|ʊː}} (if it doesn't merge with {{IPA|/ɔː/}} ~ {{IPA|/ɔə/}}), {{IPAblink|ɔː}} and {{IPAblink|æː}} ~ {{IPAblink|aː}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=305, 309}} {{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982}} states that "no rigid rules can be given for the distribution of monophthongal and diphthongal variants, though the tendency seems to be for the monophthongal variants to be commonest within the utterance, but the diphthongal realisations in utterance-final position, or where the syllable in question is otherwise prominent."{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=305–306}}
** Triphthongal realizations {{IPA|[ɪi̯ɐ̯, ɛi̯ə̯, ɔu̯ə̯, æi̯ə̯]}} of {{IPA|/iə, eə, ɔə, æʊ/}} are also possible, and are regarded as "very strongly Cockney".{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=306, 310}} Among these, the triphthongal realization of {{IPA|/ɔə/}} occurs most commonly.{{sfnp|Mott|2012|p=78}} There is not a complete agreement about the distribution of these; according to {{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982}}, they "occur in sentence-final position",{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=306}} whereas according to {{Harvcoltxt|Mott|2012}}, these are "most common in final position".{{sfnp|Mott|2012|p=78}}
*Other vowel differences include
** {{IPA|/æ/}} may be {{IPAblink|ɛ}} or {{IPA|[ɛɪ]}}, with the latter occurring before voiced consonants, particularly before {{IPA|/d/}}:{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=305}}{{sfnp|Hughes|Trudgill|1979|p=35}} {{IPA|[bɛk]}} "back", {{IPA|[bɛːɪd]}} "bad"
** {{IPA|/ɛ/}} may be {{IPA|[eə]}}, {{IPA|[eɪ]}}, or {{IPA|[ɛɪ]}} before certain voiced consonants, particularly before {{IPA|/d/}}:{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=305}}{{sfnp|Sivertsen|1960|p=54}}{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=129}}{{sfnp|Cruttenden|2001|p=110}} {{IPA|[beɪd]}} "bed"
** {{IPA|/ɒ/}} may be a somewhat less open {{IPAblink|ɔ}}:{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=305}} {{IPA|[kʰɔʔ]}} "cot"
** {{IPA|/ɑː/}} has a fully back variant, qualitatively equivalent to [[Cardinal vowel#Table of cardinal vowels|cardinal 5]], which Beaken (1971) claims characterises "vigorous, informal" cockney.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=305}}
** {{IPA|/ɜː/}} is on occasion somewhat fronted and/or lightly rounded, giving cockney variants such as {{IPAblink|ɜ|ɜ̟ː}}, {{IPAblink|œ|œ̈ː}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=305}}
** {{IPA|/ʌ/}} → {{IPAblink|ɐ|ɐ̟}} or a quality like that of cardinal 4, {{IPAblink|a}}:{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=305}}{{sfnp|Hughes|Trudgill|1979|p=35}} {{IPA|[dʒamʔˈtˢapʰ]}} "jumped up"
** {{IPA|/ɔː/}} → {{IPAblink|oː}} or a closing diphthong of the type {{IPA|[oʊ~ɔo]}} when in non-final position, with the latter variants being more common in broad cockney:{{sfnp|Matthews|1938|p=35}}{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=310–311}} {{IPA|[soʊs]}} "sauce"-"source", {{IPA|[loʊd]}} "lord", {{IPA|[ˈwoʊʔə]}} "water"
** {{IPA|/ɔː/}} → {{IPAblink|ɔː}} or a centring diphthong/triphthong of the type {{IPA|[ɔə~ɔuə]}} when in final position, with the latter variants being more common in broad cockney; thus {{IPA|[sɔə]}} "saw"-"sore"-"soar", {{IPA|[lɔə]}} "law"-"lore", {{IPA|[wɔə]}} "war"-"wore". The diphthong is retained before inflectional endings, so that ''board'' and ''pause'' can contrast with ''bored'' {{IPA|[bɔəd]}} and ''paws'' {{IPA|[pʰɔəz]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=310–311}} {{IPA|/ɔə/}} has a somewhat tenser onset than the cardinal {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, that is {{IPA|[ɔ̝ə]}}.{{sfnp|Mott|2012|p=77}}
** {{IPA|/əʊ/}} becomes something around {{IPA|[ɒʊ~ɔo]}} or even {{IPA|[aɤ]}} in broad cockney before [[Velarized alveolar lateral approximant|dark l]]. These variants are retained when the addition of a suffix turns the dark l [[Alveolar lateral approximant|clear]]. Thus a phonemic split has occurred in London English, exemplified by the minimal pair ''wholly'' {{IPA|[ˈhɒʊli]}} vs. ''holy'' {{IPA|[ˈhɐɤ̈li]}}. The development of ''L''-vocalisation (see next section) leads to further pairs such as ''sole''-''soul'' {{IPA|[sɒʊ]}} vs. ''so''-''sew'' {{IPA|[sɐɤ̈]}}, ''bowl'' {{IPA|[bɒʊ]}} vs. ''Bow'' {{IPA|[bɐɤ̈]}}, ''shoulder'' {{IPA|[ˈʃɒʊdə]}} vs. ''odour'' {{IPA|[ˈɐɤ̈də]}}, while associated vowel neutralisations may make ''doll'' a homophone of ''dole'', compare ''dough'' {{IPA|[dɐɤ̈]}}. All this reinforces the phonemic nature of the opposition and increases its functional load. It is now well-established in all kinds of London-flavoured accents, from broad cockney to near-RP.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=312–313}}
** {{IPA|/ʊ/}} in some words (particularly ''good''){{sfnp|Mott|2011|p=75}} is central {{IPAblink|ʊ̈}}.{{sfnp|Mott|2012|p=75}} In other cases, it is near-close near-back {{IPAblink|ʊ}}, as in traditional RP.{{sfnp|Mott|2012|p=75}}
*[[L-vocalisation|Vocalisation of dark L]], hence {{IPA|[ˈmɪowɔː]}} for [[Millwall]]. The actual realisation of a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is influenced by surrounding vowels and it may be realised as {{IPA|[u]}}, {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[ɤ]}}. It is also transcribed as a [[semivowel]] {{IPA|[w]}} by some linguists, e.g., Coggle and Rosewarne.{{sfnp|Sivertsen|1960|p=132}} However, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}, the vocalised dark l is sometimes an unoccluded lateral approximant, which differs from the RP {{IPA|[ɫ]}} only by the lack of the alveolar contact.{{sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=193}} Relatedly, there are many possible vowel neutralisations and absorptions in the context of a following dark L ({{IPA|[ɫ]}}) or its vocalised version; these include:{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=313–317}}
**In broad cockney, and to some extent in general popular London speech, a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is entirely absorbed by a preceding {{IPA|/ɔː/}}: e.g., ''salt'' and ''sort'' become homophones (although the contemporary pronunciation of ''salt'' {{IPA|/sɒlt/}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/activities/phonological-change/ |title=Phonological change in spoken English |publisher=Bl.uk |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> would prevent this from happening), and likewise ''fault''-''fought''-''fort'', ''pause''-''Paul's'', ''Morden''-''Malden'', ''water''-''Walter''. Sometimes such pairs are kept apart, in more deliberate speech at least, by a kind of length difference: {{IPA|[ˈmɔʊdn̩]}} ''Morden'' vs. {{IPA|[ˈmɔʊːdn̩]}} ''Malden''.
**A preceding {{IPA|/ə/}} is also fully absorbed into vocalised {{IPA|/l/}}. The reflexes of earlier {{IPA|/əl/}} and earlier {{IPA|/ɔː(l)/}} are thus phonetically similar or identical; speakers are usually ready to treat them as the same phoneme. Thus ''awful'' can best be regarded as containing two occurrences of the same vowel, {{IPA|/ˈɔːfɔː/}}. The difference between ''musical'' and ''music-hall'', in an ''H''-dropping broad cockney, is thus nothing more than a matter of stress and perhaps syllable boundaries.
**With the remaining vowels a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is not absorbed, but remains phonetically present as a back vocoid in such a way that {{IPA|/Vl/}} and {{IPA|/V/}} are kept distinct.
**The clearest and best-established neutralisations are those of {{IPA|/ɪ~iː~ɪə/}} and {{IPA|/ʊ~uː~ʊə/}}. Thus ''rill'', ''reel'' and ''real'' fall together in cockney as {{IPA|[ɹɪɤ]}}; while ''full'' and ''fool'' are {{IPA|[foʊ~fʊu]}} and may rhyme with ''cruel'' {{IPA|[ˈkʰɹʊu]}}. Before clear (i.e., prevocalic) {{IPA|/l/}} the neutralisations do not usually apply, thus {{IPA|[ˈsɪli]}} ''silly'' but {{IPA|[ˈsɪilɪn]}} ''ceiling''-''sealing'', {{IPA|[ˈfʊli]}} ''fully'' but {{IPA|[ˈfʊulɪn]}} ''fooling''.
**In some broader types of cockney, the neutralisation of {{IPA|/ʊ~uː~ʊə/}} before non-prevocalic {{IPA|/l/}} may also involve {{IPA|/ɔː/}}, so that ''fall'' becomes homophonous with ''full'' and ''fool'' {{IPA|[fɔo]}}.
**The other pre-{{IPA|/l/}} neutralisation which all investigators agree on is that of {{IPA|/æ~eɪ~aʊ/}}. Thus, ''Sal'' and ''sale'' can be merged as {{IPA|[sæɤ]}}, ''fail'' and ''fowl'' as {{IPA|[fæɤ]}}, and ''Val'', ''vale''-''veil'' and ''vowel'' as {{IPA|[væɤ]}}. The typical pronunciation of ''railway'' is {{IPA|[ˈɹæʊwæɪ]}}.
**According to Siversten, {{IPA|/ɑː/}} and {{IPA|/aɪ/}} can also join in this neutralisation. They may on the one hand neutralise with respect to one another, so that ''snarl'' and ''smile'' rhyme, both ending {{IPA|[-ɑɤ]}}, and ''Child's Hill'' is in danger of being mistaken for ''Charles Hill''; or they may go further into a fivefold neutralisation with the one just mentioned, so that ''pal'', ''pale'', ''foul'', ''snarl'' and ''pile'' all end in {{IPA|[-æɤ]}}. But these developments are evidently restricted to broad cockney, not being found in London speech in general.
**A neutralisation discussed by Beaken (1971) and Bowyer (1973), but ignored by Siversten (1960), is that of {{IPA|/ɒ~əʊ~ʌ/}}. It leads to the possibility of ''doll'', ''dole'' and ''dull'' becoming homophonous as {{IPA|[dɒʊ]}} or {{IPA|[da̠ɤ]}}. Wells' impression is that the ''doll''-''dole'' neutralisation is rather widespread in London, but that involving ''dull'' less so.
**One further possible neutralisation in the environment of a following non-prevocalic {{IPA|/l/}} is that of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɜː/}}, so that ''well'' and ''whirl'' become homophonous as {{IPA|[wɛʊ]}}.
*Cockney has been occasionally described as replacing {{IPA|/ɹ/}} with {{IPA|/w/}}. For example, ''thwee'' (or ''fwee'') instead of ''three'', ''fwasty'' instead of ''frosty''. Peter Wright, a [[Survey of English Dialects]] fieldworker, concluded that this was not a universal feature of cockneys but that it was more common to hear this in the London area than anywhere else in Britain.{{sfnp|Wright|1981|p=135}} This description may also be a result of mishearing the [[R-labialisation|labiodental R]] as {{IPA|/w/}}, when it is still a distinct phoneme in cockney.
*An unstressed final ''-ow'' may be pronounced {{IPAblink|ə}}. In broad cockney this can be lowered to {{IPAblink|ɐ}}.<ref name="ic.arizona.edu"/>{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=305}} This is common to most traditional, Southern English dialects except for those in the [[West Country]].{{sfnp|Wright|1981|p=134}}
*Grammatical features:<ref name="bucknell"/>
**Use of ''me'' instead of ''my'', for example, "At's me book you got 'ere". It cannot be used when "my" is emphasised; e.g., "At's <u>''my''</u> book you got 'ere" (and not "their").
**Use of ''[[ain't]]''
*Use of [[double negatives]], for example "I didn't see nuffink".{{sfnp|Wright|1981|p=122}}
By the 1980s and 1990s, most of the features mentioned above had partly spread into more general south-eastern speech, giving the accent called [[Estuary English]]; an Estuary speaker will use some but not all of the cockney sounds.<ref name="D Rosewarne">{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/rosew.htm |title=Rosewarne, David (1984).

===Perception===
The cockney accent has long been looked down upon and thought of as inferior by many. For example, in 1909 the Conference on the Teaching of English in London Elementary Schools issued by the [[London County Council]], stating that "the Cockney mode of speech, with its unpleasant twang, is a modern corruption without legitimate credentials, and is unworthy of being the speech of any person in the capital city of the [[British Empire|Empire]]".<ref name="Attitudes towards Cockney">{{cite web|url=http://www.humnet.unipi.it/slifo/articolosantipolo.pdf |title=5 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> Others defended the language variety: "The London dialect is really, especially on the South side of the Thames, a perfectly legitimate and responsible child of the old kentish tongue [...] the dialect of London North of the Thames has been shown to be one of the many varieties of the Midland or Mercian dialect, flavoured by the East Anglian variety of the same speech".<ref name="Attitudes towards Cockney"/> Since then, the cockney accent has been more accepted as an alternative form of the English language rather than an inferior one. In the 1950s, the only accent to be heard on the [[BBC]] (except in entertainment programmes such as ''[[The Sooty Show]]'') was [[Received Pronunciation|RP]], whereas nowadays many different accents, including cockney or accents heavily influenced by it, can be heard on the BBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/yourvoice/rpandbbc3.shtml#A |title=BBC English |publisher=BBC English |date= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> In a survey of 2,000 people conducted by [[Coolbrands]] in the autumn of 2008, cockney was voted equal fourth [[coolest]] accent in Britain with 7% of the votes, while [[Received Pronunciation|The Queen's English]] was considered the coolest, with 20% of the votes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3073282/Brummie-accent-voted-least-cool-in-Britain.html|title=RP still most popular accent |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date = September 2008|accessdate=18 March 2009 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Irvine}}</ref> [[Brummie]] was voted least popular, receiving just 2%. The cockney accent often featured in films produced by [[Ealing Studios]] and was frequently portrayed as the typical British accent in movies by [[Walt Disney]].

===Spread===
Studies have indicated that the heavy use of [[South East England]] accents on television and radio may be the cause of the spread of cockney English since the 1960s.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3531075.stm |title=Soaps may be washing out accent&nbsp;– BBC Scotland |publisher=BBC News |date=4 March 2004 |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref><ref name="We fink, so we are from Glasgow">{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1036798.ece |title='We fink, so we are from Glasgow' |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref><ref name="Scots kids rabbitin' like Cockneys">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_/ai_n16503073 |title="Scots kids rabbitin' like Cockneys"&nbsp;– '&#39;Sunday Herald'&#39; |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=21 January 2013 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name="arts.gla.ac.uk">[http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/sesll/EngLang/phonetics/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530235558/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/sesll/EngLang/phonetics/index.html|date=30 May 2008}}</ref> Cockney is more and more influential and some claim that in the future many features of the accent may become standard.<ref name="rogalinski11">{{cite book|last=Rogaliński|first=Paweł|title=British Accents: Cockney, RP, Estuary English|year=2011|page=15}}</ref>

Frankfurt: Peter Lang|publisher=}}</ref> However, [[Clive Upton]] has noted that these features have occurred independently in some other dialects, such as TH-fronting in Yorkshire and L-vocalisation in parts of Scotland.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Upton |first1=Clive|editor1-first=Lynda |editor1-last=Mugglestone |title=The Oxford History of English|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford|page=395 |chapter=Modern Regional English in the British Isles }}</ref>

The term [[Estuary English]] has been used to describe London pronunciations that are slightly closer to RP than cockney. The variety first came to public prominence in an article by David Rosewarne in the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' in October 1984.<ref name=rosewarne>{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/rosew.htm |title=Rosewarne, David (1984). '&#39;Estuary English'&#39;. Times Educational Supplement, 19 (October 1984) |publisher=Phon.ucl.ac.uk |date=1999-05-21 |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref> Rosewarne argued that it may eventually replace [[Received Pronunciation]] in the south-east. The phonetician [[John C. Wells]] collected media references to Estuary English on [http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/ a website]. Writing in April 2013, Wells argued that research by Joanna Przedlacka "demolished the claim that EE was a single entity sweeping the southeast. Rather, we have various sound changes emanating from working-class London speech, each spreading independently".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/estuariality.html|title=estuariality |last1=Wells |first1=John |date=17 April 2013 |accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref>
