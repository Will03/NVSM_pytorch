{{Korean grammar}}

There are seven [[Inflection|verb paradigm]]s or [[register_(sociolinguistics)|speech levels]] in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike "[[Korean honorifics|honorifics]]" – which are used to show respect towards someone mentioned in a sentence – speech levels are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience, or reflect the formality or informality of the situation. 

The names of the seven levels are derived from the non-honorific [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form of the verb ''hada'' ([[wikt:하다|하다]]; "to do") in each level, plus the suffix ''che'' ([[wikt:체|체]]), which means "style". Each Korean speech level can be combined with honorific or non-honorific noun and verb forms. Taken together, there are 14 combinations. 

These days, some of these speech levels are disappearing from use in everyday life. ''Hasoseoche'', which is used only in movies or dramas set in older eras, is barely used by modern Koreans, and ''hageche'' exists almost only in novels.

==Higher levels==

'''Formally polite'''<br> This conversational style is generally called either the "formal" or the "formal polite". Another name for this is ''hapsyo-che'' or 합쇼체  This is a common style of speaking. A conversation with a stranger will generally start out in this style and gradually fade into more and more frequent ''haeyo-che''. It is used 
* between strangers at the start of a conversation
* among colleagues in more formal settings
* by TV announcers 
* to customers 
* in certain fixed expressions like 만나서 반갑습니다 ''mannaseo bangapseumnida'' "Pleased to meet you"

|}

==Middle levels==
The middle levels are used when there is some conflict or uncertainty about the social status of one or both participants in a conversation. The ''hage-che'' and ''hao-che'' are being replaced by or merging with ''haeyo-che''. 
=== Haeyo-che ===
<div style="margin-left: 2em; float: right;">

</div>
'''Casually polite'''<br> This speech style is called the "polite" style in English. Like 해체 (Hae-che), it is a [[defective verb|defective]] paradigm, meaning it lacks most of the expected conjugational forms. Unlike other speech styles, basic conjugations for [[Declarative sentence|declarative]], [[interrogative]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]] are identical, depending on intonation and context or other additional suffixes. Most Korean phrasebooks for foreigners follow this speech style due to its simplicity and proper politeness. Second person pronouns are generally omitted in polite speech styles. See [[Korean pronouns]]. It is used:
* In Korean phrasebooks for foreigners.
* Between strangers, especially those older or of equal age.
* Between colleagues
* By younger speakers as a less old-fashioned alternative to the ''hao-che''.
* By men and women in [[Seoul]] as a less formal alternative to the ''hasipsio-che''.

'''Formally neither polite nor impolite'''<br>
This conversational style is called the "semi-formal," "middle," "formal lateral," or "authoritarian" style in English. In Seoul, the 쇼 ''-syo'' ending is frequently pronounced 수 ''su''. It was originally a refined, poetic style that people resorted to in ambiguous social situations, but, due to its over-use by authority figures during Korea's period of dictatorship, it became associated with power and bureaucracy and gained a negative connotation. Consequently, the generation of Koreans who came of age after democratization conspicuously avoid using it. It is used:
* Occasionally among the older generation, by civil servants, police officers, middle management, middle-aged people, and other people of intermediate social rank who have temporary authority over what would normally be considered their superiors
* In historical dramas, where it gives the dialogue a more old-fashioned sound.
* In the spoken form of certain dialects, such as the [[Hamgyŏng dialect]].

'''Neither formal nor casual, neither polite nor impolite'''<br> This conversational style is called the "familiar." It is intermediate in politeness between  ''haeyo-che'' and ''hae-che''. It is not used to address children, and is never used to address blood relatives. It is used only:
* By some older people when addressing younger people or especially in-laws in a friendly manner.
* Between adult male friends, occasionally.
* In novels

==Lower levels==
The ''hae-che'' and ''haera-che'' styles are frequently mixed together in the same conversation, so much so that it can be hard to tell what verb endings belong to which style. 
Endings that may be used in either style are:
*Question: -니?/-냐?/-느냐?
*Proposition: -자. (this is roughly equivalent to "let's" in English)
*Casual statement: -지. (this is roughly equivalent to "I suppose")
*Casual question: -지?. (this is roughly equivalent to "I wonder if" in English)
*Exclamation: -구나! -다!

=== Haera-che ===
<div style="margin-left: 2em; float: right;">
{| class="wikitable"
! Name || '''Haera-che'''<br/>([[wikt:해라체|해라체]])

! Formality || high

|}
</div>
'''Formally impolite'''<br>
This conversational style is generally called the "plain" style. In writing and quoting, the plain style is the equivalent of the third person. Any other written style would feel like a first person account (that is, anything else would seem to be told in the main character's own voice). It is used:
* To close friends or relatives of similar age, and by adults to children.
* In impersonal writing (books, newspapers, and magazines) and indirect quotations ("She said that...").
* In grammar books, to give examples.
* In some exclamations.

'''Casually impolite'''<br>
This conversational style is called the "intimate" in English. Like 해요체 (Haeyo-che), it is a [[defective verb|defective]] paradigm, meaning it lacks most of the expected conjugational forms. Basic conjugations for [[Declarative sentence|declarative]], [[interrogative]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]] are identical, depending on intonation and context or other additional suffixes. It is used 
* Between close friends and relatives.
* When talking to children.
