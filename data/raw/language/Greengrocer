A '''greengrocer''', also called a '''produce market''' or '''fruiterer''', is a [[retail]] trader in [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s; that is, in green  [[grocer]]ies.<ref name="IntrotoPoetry">{{cite book|last=Driscoll|first=Michael|author2=Meredith Hamiltion |author3=Marie Coons |title=A Child's Introduction to Poetry|publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers|location=151 West 19th Street New York, NY 10011|date=May 2003|pages=12|isbn=1-57912-282-5|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Childs-Introduction-to-Poetry/Michael-Driscoll/e/9781579122829}}</ref> Greengrocer is primarily a [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Australia|Australian]] term, and greengrocers' shops were once common in cities, towns and villages. They have been affected by the dominant rise of [[supermarkets]], but many can be found managing small shops or stores in towns and cities and in some villages. Greengrocers can also be found in street markets and malls, or managing produce departments at supermarkets. Such traders typically handle the entire business of buying, selling, and book-keeping themselves.

A [[syndicated television]] segment entitled "The Green Grocer" featured consumer advocate [[Joe Carcione]], advising viewers on how to best shop for fruits and vegetables.  This popular segment aired during the 1970s and 1980s in the United States and Canada.<ref name=obit>[http://articles.philly.com/1988-08-03/news/26257551_1_green-grocer-joe-carcione-wpvi Joe Carcione obituary] by Kitty Dumas, Philadelphia Inquirer, August 3, 1988.</ref>

== Greengrocers' apostrophe ==
Because of its misuse on greengrocers' signs, an apostrophe used incorrectly to form a [[English plural|plural]] — such as ''apple's'', ''orange's'' or ''banana's'' — is known as a [[Apostrophe#Superfluous_apostrophes_.28.22greengrocers.27_apostrophes.22.29|greengrocers' apostrophe]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Quinion|first=Michael|title=Possessive Apostrophes: The greengrocer's speciality|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/apostrophe.htm|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref>
