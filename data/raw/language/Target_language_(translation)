In [[translation]], the '''target language''', also called the '''receptor language'''<ref>Willis Barnstone, ''The Poetics of Translation'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993), p. 228.</ref>, is the language being translated to.  It is the antonym of [[Source language (translation)|source language]], which is the language being translated from.<ref>Basil Hatim and Jeremy Munday, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3gZc6rCduLYC&pg=PA171&dq=target+language+translation&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wlyiU8Mqh7TRBdHUgcgG&ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=target%20language%20translation&f=false Translation: An Advanced Resource Book], Introduction, pg. xx. [[Milton Park]]: [[Routledge]], 2004. {{ISBN|9780415283052}}</ref>

In most professional settings, the target language is also the translator's [[first language]].<ref>Carline FÃ©Railleur-Dumoulin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2BK1Uv0wgAC&pg=PA36&dq=target+language+translation&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wlyiU8Mqh7TRBdHUgcgG&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=target%20language%20translation&f=false A Career in Language Translation: Insightful Information to Guide You in Your Journey as a Professional Translator], pg. 1. [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]: [[AuthorHouse]], 2009. {{ISBN|9781467052047}}</ref> Translation for specialized or professional fields often requires a working knowledge as well of the pertinent terminologies in the target language. For example, translation of a legal text requires not only fluency in the target language but also familiarity with the terminology specific to the legal field in the target language.<ref>Gerard-Rene de Groot, "Translating legal information." Taken from [https://books.google.com/books?id=e1Fjal9DNpoC&pg=PA132&dq=target+language+translation&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2l-iU_y3MqSP0AWk0IDwAg&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=target%20language%20translation&f=false Translation in Law], vol. 5 of the Journal of Legal Hermeneutics, pg. 132. Ed. Giuseppe Zaccaria. [[Hamburg]]: LIT Verlag Munster, 2000. {{ISBN|9783825848620}}</ref>

While the form and style of the source language often cannot be reproduced in the target language, the meaning and content can. Linguist [[Roman Jakobson]] went so far as to assert that all cognitive experience can be classified and expressed in any living language.<ref>Basil Hatim and Jeremy Munday, ''Translation'', pg. 10.</ref>
