'''Sign languages''' (also known as '''signed languages''') are [[language]]s that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning. Language is expressed via the manual signstream in combination with [[Sign language#Non-manual elements|non-manual elements]]. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon.<ref name=":0" /> This means that sign languages are not universal and they are not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]],<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Sign Language?|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|accessdate=10 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213195125/https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|archivedate=13 February 2018|df=}}</ref> although there are also striking similarities among sign languages.

Linguists consider both spoken and signed communication to be types of [[natural language]], meaning that both emerged through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolved over time without meticulous planning. Sign language should not be confused with [[body language]], a type of [[non verbal communication|nonverbal communication]].

Wherever communities of [[deaf]] people exist, sign languages have developed as handy means of communication and they form the core of local [[deaf culture]]s. Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and [[Hearing loss|hard of hearing]], it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, those who have trouble with spoken language due to a disability or condition ([[augmentative and alternative communication]]), or those with deaf family members, such as [[Child of deaf adult|children of deaf adults]].

It is unclear how many sign languages currently exist worldwide. Each country generally has its own, native sign language, and some have more than one. The 2013 edition of ''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists 137 sign languages.<ref>{{citation

Linguists distinguish natural sign languages from other systems that are precursors to them or derived from them, such as invented manual codes for spoken languages, [[home sign]], "baby sign", and signs learned by non-human primates.

Groups of deaf people have used sign languages throughout history. One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', where [[Socrates]] says: "If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?"<ref name="bauman2008">{{cite book | first=Dirksen | last=Bauman |  year=2008 | title=Open your eyes: Deaf studies talking | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn=978-0-8166-4619-7}}</ref>

Until the 19th century, most of what is known about historical sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself. [[Pedro Ponce de León]] (1520–1584) is said to have developed the first manual alphabet.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nielsen |first1= K.E..|title=A Disability History of the United States |date=2012 |publisher= Beacon Press |isbn=9780807022047 }}</ref>

In 1620, [[Juan Pablo Bonet]] published {{lang|es|Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos}} (‘Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak’) in Madrid.<ref>Pablo Bonet, J. de (1620) ''Reduction de las letras y Arte para enseñar á ablar los Mudos''.

[[File:Jbulwer.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Chirogram from ''Chirologia'', 1644]]
In Britain, manual alphabets were also in use for a number of purposes, such as secret communication,<ref>Wilkins, John (1641). ''Mercury, the Swift and Silent Messenger''. The book is a work on cryptography, and fingerspelling was referred to as one method of "secret discoursing, by signes and gestures".  Wilkins gave an example of such a system: "Let the tops of the fingers signifie the five vowels; the middle parts, the first five consonants; the bottomes of them, the five next consonants; the spaces betwixt the fingers the foure next.  One finger laid on the side of the hand may signifie T.  Two fingers V the consonant; Three W.  The little finger crossed X.  The wrist Y.  The middle of the hand Z." (1641:116-117)</ref> public speaking, or communication by deaf people.<ref>John Bulwer's "Chirologia: or the natural language of the hand.", published in 1644, London, mentions that alphabets are in use by deaf people, although Bulwer presents a different system which is focused on public speaking.</ref> In 1648, [[John Bulwer]] described "Master Babington", a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual alphabet, "contryved on the joynts of his fingers", whose wife could converse with him easily, even in the dark through the use of [[tactile signing]].<ref>Bulwer, J. (1648) ''Philocopus, or the Deaf and Dumbe Mans Friend'', London: Humphrey and Moseley.</ref>

In 1680, [[George Dalgarno]] published ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor'',<ref>Dalgarno, George. ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor''. Oxford: Halton, 1680.</ref> in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an "arthrological" alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time;<ref>See Wilkins (1641) above. Wilkins was aware that the systems he describes are old, and refers to Bede's account of Roman and Greek finger alphabets.</ref> some have speculated that they can be traced to early [[Ogham]] manual alphabets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |title=Session 9 |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date=2000-11-07 |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602102335/http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |archivedate=2010-06-02 |df= }}</ref><ref>Montgomery, G. "The Ancient Origins of Sign Handshapes" ''Sign Language Studies'' '''2'''(3) (2002): 322-334.</ref>

The [[vowel]]s of this alphabet have survived in the contemporary alphabets used in [[British Sign Language]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]]. The earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern [[two-handed alphabet]] appeared in 1698 with ''Digiti Lingua'' (Latin for ''Language'' [or ''Tongue''] ''of the Finger''), a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak.<ref>Moser H.M., O'Neill J.J., Oyer H.J., Wolfe S.M., Abernathy E.A., and Schowe, B.M. "Historical Aspects of Manual Communication" ''Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders'' '''25''' (1960) 145-151.<br />
and Hay, A. and Lee, R. ''A Pictorial History of the evolution of the British Manual Alphabet'' (British Deaf History Society Publications: Middlesex, 2004)</ref>  He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence and secrecy, or purely for entertainment. Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted.

[[Charles de La Fin]] published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems.<ref>Charles de La Fin (1692). ''Sermo mirabilis, or, The silent language whereby one may learn ... how to impart his mind to his friend, in any language ... being a wonderful art kept secret for several ages in Padua, and now published only to the wise and prudent ...'' London, Printed for Tho. Salusbury... and sold by Randal Taylor... 1692. {{OCLC|27245872}}</ref> He described such codes for both English and Latin.

By 1720, the British manual alphabet had found more or less its present form.<ref>Daniel Defoe (1720). "The Life and Adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell"</ref> Descendants of this alphabet have been used by deaf communities (or at least in classrooms) in former British colonies India, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda and South Africa, as well as the republics and provinces of the former Yugoslavia, Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean, Indonesia, Norway, Germany and the United States.

Frenchman [[Abbé de l'Épée|Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] published his manual alphabet in the 18th century, which has survived basically unchanged in France and North America until the present time. In 1755, Abbé de l'Épée founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; [[Laurent Clerc]] was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc went to the United States with [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] to found the [[American School for the Deaf]] in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.<ref>Canlas (2006).</ref> Gallaudet's son, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College. Now called [[Gallaudet University]], it is still the only liberal arts university for deaf people in the world.

{{Anchor| not speech based}} Sign languages generally do not have any linguistic relation to the spoken languages of the lands in which they arise. The correlation between sign and spoken languages is complex and varies depending on the country more than the spoken language. For example, the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand all have English as their dominant language, but [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), used in the US and English-speaking Canada, is derived from [[French Sign Language]] whereas the other three countries sign dialects of [[BANZSL|British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bfi |title=Ethnologue report for language code: bfi |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009095734/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bfi |archivedate=2012-10-09 |df= }}</ref>  Similarly, the sign languages of Spain and Mexico are very different, despite Spanish being the national language in each country,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/2007/silesr2007-008.pdf |title=SIL Electronic Survey Reports: Spanish Sign Language survey |publisher=Sil.org |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020141343/http://www.sil.org/silesr/2007/silesr2007-008.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}</ref> and the sign language used in Bolivia is based on ASL rather than any sign language that is used in a Spanish-speaking country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/2009/silesr2009-002.pdf |title=SIL Electronic Survey Reports: Bolivia deaf community and sign language pre-survey report |publisher=Sil.org |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915024309/http://www.sil.org/silesr/2009/silesr2009-002.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}</ref>  Variations also arise within a 'national' sign language which don't necessarily correspond to dialect differences in the national spoken language; rather, they can usually be correlated to the geographic location of residential schools for the deaf.<ref>[[Lucas, Ceil]], Robert Bayley and [[Clayton Valli]]. 2001.

[[International Sign]], formerly known as Gestuno, is used mainly at international deaf events such as the [[Deaflympics]] and meetings of the [[World Federation of the Deaf]]. While recent studies claim that International Sign is a kind of a [[pidgin]], they conclude that it is more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like a full sign language.<ref>Cf.

== Linguistics ==
In linguistic terms, sign languages are as rich and complex as any spoken language, despite the common misconception that they are not "real languages". Professional [[linguistics|linguists]] have studied many sign languages and found that they exhibit the fundamental properties that exist in all languages.<ref>[[Edward Klima|Klima, Edward S.]]; & [[Ursula Bellugi|Bellugi, Ursula]]. (1979). ''The signs of language''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-80795-2}}.</ref><ref name=":0">Sandler, Wendy; & Lillo-Martin, Diane. (2006). Sign Language and Linguistic Universals. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>

Sign languages are not [[mime]]—in other words, signs are conventional, often arbitrary and do not necessarily have a visual relationship to their referent, much as most spoken language is not [[onomatopoeic]]. While [[iconicity]] is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones, the difference is not categorical.<ref>Johnston (1989).</ref> The visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning, present but suppressed in spoken languages, to be more fully expressed.<ref>Taub (2001).</ref> This does not mean that sign languages are a visual rendition of a spoken language. They have complex [[grammar]]s of their own and can be used to discuss any topic, from the simple and concrete to the lofty and abstract.

Sign languages, like spoken languages, organize elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful [[semantic]] units. (These were once called [[chereme]]s (from the Greek word for "hand") in the case of sign languages, by analogy to the [[phoneme]]s (from Greek for "voice") of spoken languages, but now also called phonemes, since the function is the same.) This is often called [[duality of patterning]]. As in spoken languages, these meaningless units are represented as (combinations of) features, although often also crude distinctions are made in terms of [[handshape]] (or ''handform''), [[Orientation (sign language)|orientation]], [[Location (sign language)|location]] (or ''place of articulation''), [[Movement (sign language)|movement]], and non-manual [[Expression (sign language)|expression]].<ref>Fabian Bross (2016). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317336147_Chereme_In_Hall_T_A_Pompino-Marschall_B_ed_Dictionaries_of_Linguistics_and_Communication_Science_Worterbucher_zur_Sprach-_und_Kommunikationswissenschaft_WSK_Volume_Phonetics_and_Phonology_Berlin_New_Y “Chereme”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317231914/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317336147_Chereme_In_Hall_T_A_Pompino-Marschall_B_ed_Dictionaries_of_Linguistics_and_Communication_Science_Worterbucher_zur_Sprach-_und_Kommunikationswissenschaft_WSK_Volume_Phonetics_and_Phonology_Berlin_New_Y |date=2018-03-17 }}. In: Hall, T. A. Pompino-Marschall, B. (ed.): Dictionaries of Linguistics and Communication Science. Volume: Phonetics and Phonology. Berlin, New York: Mouton de Gruyter.</ref> More generally, both sign and spoken languages share the [[Hockett's design features|characteristics]] that linguists have found in all natural human languages, such as transitoriness, [[semanticity]], [[arbitrariness]], [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]], and [[Traditional transmission|cultural transmission]].

Common linguistic features of many sign languages are the occurrence of [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], a high degree of [[inflection]] by means of changes of movement, and a [[Topic-comment language|topic-comment]] [[syntax]]. More than spoken languages, sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means, e.g. by the use of space, two manual articulators, and the signer's face and body.  Though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages, classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic, as these complex constructions "function as predicates that may express any or all of the following: motion, position, stative-descriptive, or handling information".<ref>Emmorey, K. (2002). Language, cognition and the brain: Insights from sign language research. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref> It needs to be noted that the term classifier is not used by everyone working on these constructions. Across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms.

Today, linguists study sign languages as true languages, part of the field of linguistics. However, the category "sign languages" was not added to the [[Linguistic Bibliography|''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'']] until the 1988 volume,<ref>p. 970-972. ''Linguistic Bibliography for the Year 1988''. Leiden, Netherlands:Brill.</ref> when it appeared with 39 entries.

=== Relationships with spoken languages ===
[[Image:Holečkova, nápis ve znakové řeči.jpg|thumb| Sign language relief sculpture on a stone wall: "Life is beautiful, be happy and love each other", by Czech sculptor [[Zuzana Čížková]] on Holečkova Street in [[Prague]]-[[Smíchov]], by a school for the deaf]]

Always there is a common misconception that sign languages are somehow dependent on spoken languages: that they are spoken language expressed in signs, or that they were invented by hearing people.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perlmutter|first=David M.|title=What is Sign Language?|url=http://www.linguisticsociety.org/files/Sign_Language.pdf|work=LSA|accessdate=4 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412004710/http://www.linguisticsociety.org/files/Sign_Language.pdf|archivedate=12 April 2014|df=}}</ref> Similarities in [[Sign language in the brain|language processing in the brain]] between signed and spoken languages further perpetuated this misconception. Hearing teachers in deaf schools, such as [[Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] or [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], are often incorrectly referred to as "inventors" of sign language.  Instead, sign languages, like all natural languages, are developed by the people who use them, in this case, deaf people, who may have little or no knowledge of any spoken language.

As a sign language develops, it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages, just as all languages borrow from other languages that they are in contact with. Sign languages vary in how and how much they borrow from spoken languages.  In many sign languages, a [[manual alphabet]] (fingerspelling) may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language, by spelling out the letters. This is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment, particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language. Fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs, such as initialized signs, in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning.

On the whole, though, sign languages are independent of spoken languages and follow their own paths of development. For example, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) are quite different and mutually unintelligible, even though the hearing people of the United Kingdom and the United States share the same spoken language. The grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages used in the same geographical area; in fact, in terms of syntax, ASL shares more with spoken [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] than it does with English.<ref>Nakamura (1995).</ref>

Similarly, countries which use a single spoken language throughout may have two or more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language. [[South Africa]], which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, is a good example of this. It has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.

=== Spatial grammar and simultaneity ===
[[File:Hello1.ogv|thumb|"Hello" in ASL (American sign language)]]
[[File:Hello2.ogv|thumb|Another variation of "hello" in ASL (American sign language)]]
Sign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium (sight), but may also exploit tactile features ([[Tactile signing|tactile sign languages]]). Spoken language is by and large linear; only one sound can be made or received at a time. Sign language, on the other hand, is visual and, hence, can use a simultaneous expression, although this is limited articulatorily and linguistically. Visual perception allows processing of simultaneous information.

One way in which many sign languages take advantage of the spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers. [[American Sign Language grammar#Numeral incorporation and classifiers|Classifiers]] allow a signer to spatially show a referent's type, size, shape, movement, or extent.

The large focus on the possibility of simultaneity in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though. The use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry<ref>Battison, Robbin (1978). ''Lexical Borrowing in American Sign Language.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstok Press.</ref> or signing with one articulator only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (internal structure of individual signs).

=== Non-manual elements ===
Sign languages convey much of their [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] through non-manual elements. Postures or movements of the body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information, including [[lexical item|lexical]] distinction, [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, [[adjective|adjectival]] or [[adverb]]ial content, and [[discourse]] functions.

At the lexical level, signs can be lexically specified for non-manual elements in addition to the manual articulation. For instance, facial expressions may accompany verbs of emotion, as in the sign for ''[https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/4/4922.mp4 angry]'' in [[Czech Sign Language]]. Non-manual elements may also be lexically contrastive. For example, in ASL (American Sign Language), facial components distinguish some signs from other signs. An example is the sign translated as ''not yet'', which requires that the tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side, in addition to the manual part of the sign. Without these features the sign would be interpreted as ''late''.<ref>Liddell, Scott K. (2003). ''Grammar, Gesture, and Meaning in American Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> [[Mouthing]]s, which are (parts of) spoken words accompanying lexical signs, can also be contrastive, as in the manually identical signs for ''doctor'' and ''battery'' in [[Dutch Sign Language|Sign Language of the Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=SignGram blueprint: A guide to sign language grammar writing |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |editor1=Josep Quer i Carbonell |editor2=Carlo Cecchetto |editor3=Rannveig Sverrisd Ãttir |year=2017 |isbn=9781501511806 |oclc=1012688117}}</ref>

While the content of a signed sentence is produced manually, many grammatical functions are produced non-manually (i.e., with the face and the torso).<ref>Fabian Bross & Daniel Hole: [https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ Scope-taking strategies in German Sign Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317232058/https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ |date=2018-03-17 }}. In: Glossa. A Journal of General Linguistics, 2(1): 76. 1-30</ref> Such functions include questions, negation, relative clauses and topicalization.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boudreault|first=Patrick|author2=Mayberry, Rachel I.|year=2006|title=Grammatical processing in American Sign Language: Age of first-language acquisition effects in relation to syntactic structure|journal=Language and Cognitive Processes|volume=21|issue=5|pages=608–635|doi=10.1080/01690960500139363}}</ref> ASL and BSL use similar non-manual marking for yes/no questions, for example. They are shown through raised eyebrows and a forward head tilt.<ref name="Baker&Cokely">Baker, Charlotte, and Dennis Cokely (1980). ''American Sign Language: A teacher's resource text on grammar and culture.'' Silver Spring, MD: T.J. Publishers.</ref><ref name="Sutton-Spence&Woll">Sutton-Spence, Rachel, and Bencie Woll (1998). ''The linguistics of British Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>

Some adjectival and adverbial information is conveyed through non-manual elements, but what these elements are varies from language to language. For instance, in ASL a slightly open mouth with the tongue relaxed and visible in the corner of the mouth means 'carelessly', but a similar non-manual in BSL means 'boring' or 'unpleasant'.<ref name=Sutton-Spence&Woll />

Discourse functions such as [[conversation analysis|turn taking]] are largely regulated through head movement and eye gaze. Since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer, a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by not looking at them, or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact.<ref>Baker, Charlotte (1977). Regulators and turn-taking in American Sign Language discourse, in Lynn Friedman, ''On the other hand: New perspectives on American Sign Language.'' New York: Academic Press</ref>

=== Iconicity ===
The first studies on [[iconicity]] in ASL were published in the late 1970s, and early 1980s.  Many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of the language.<ref>Frishberg (1975)</ref><ref>Klima & Bellugi (1979)</ref> Though they recognized that certain aspects of the language seemed iconic, they considered this to be merely extralinguistic, a property which did not influence the language. However, mimetic aspects of sign language (signs that imitate, mimic, or represent) are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages. For example, deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign, they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties.<ref>Klima, Edward; Bellugi, Ursula. "The Signs of Language." Sign Language Studies, vol. 1062, no. 1, 1989, pp. 11.</ref> Though it never disappears from a particular sign language, iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammaticized. As a form becomes more conventional, it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically to the rest of the sign language community.<ref>Brentari, Diane. "Introduction." Sign Languages, 2011, pp. 12.</ref> Frishberg (1975) wrote a very influential paper addressing the relationship between arbitrariness and iconicity in ASL. She concluded that though originally present in many signs, iconicity is degraded over time through the application of grammatical processes. In other words, over time, the natural processes of regularization in the language obscures any iconically motivated features of the sign.

Some researchers have suggested that the properties of ASL give it a clear advantage in terms of learning and memory.<ref>Brown 1980</ref> Psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] was one of the first to document this benefit. In his study, Brown found that when children were taught signs that had high levels of iconic mapping they were significantly more likely to recall the signs in a later memory task than when they were taught signs that had little or no iconic properties.

A central task for the pioneers of sign language linguistics was trying to prove that ASL was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or "English on the hands." One of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that 'real languages' must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning. Thus, if ASL consisted of signs that had iconic form-meaning relationship, it could not be considered a real language. As a result, iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages.

The [[cognitive linguistics]] perspective rejects a more traditional definition of iconicity as a relationship between linguistic form and a concrete, real-world referent. Rather it is a set of selected correspondences between the form and meaning of a sign.<ref name="Taub 2001">Taub (2001)</ref> In this view, iconicity is grounded in a language user's mental representation ("[[construal]]" in [[cognitive grammar]]). It is defined as a fully grammatical and central aspect of a sign language rather than a peripheral phenomenon.<ref>Wilcox (2004)</ref>

The cognitive linguistics perspective allows for some signs to be fully iconic or partially iconic given the number of correspondences between the possible parameters of form and meaning.<ref name="Wilcox 2000">Wilcox (2000)</ref> In this way, the [[Israeli Sign Language]] (ISL) sign for "ask" has parts of its form that are iconic ("movement away from the mouth" means "something coming from the mouth"), and parts that are arbitrary (the handshape, and the orientation).<ref name="Meir 2010">Meir (2010)</ref>

Many signs have [[metaphoric]] mappings as well as iconic or metonymic ones. For these signs there are three way correspondences between a form, a concrete source and an abstract target meaning. The ASL sign LEARN has this three way correspondence. The abstract target meaning is "learning". The concrete source is putting objects into the head from books. The form is a grasping hand moving from an open palm to the forehead. The iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source. The metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning. Because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as "double mapped".<ref name="Taub 2001"/><ref name="Wilcox 2000"/><ref name="Meir 2010"/>

Although sign languages have emerged naturally in deaf communities alongside or among spoken languages, they are unrelated to spoken languages and have different grammatical structures at their core.

Sign languages may be classified by how they arise.

In non-signing communities, [[home sign]] is not a full language, but closer to a [[pidgin]]. Home sign is amorphous and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family, where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign. Such systems are not generally passed on from one generation to the next. Where they are passed on, [[creole genesis|creolization]] would be expected to occur, resulting in a full language.  However, home sign may also be closer to full language in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language; examples include various [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] and gestural systems across West Africa, such as [[Mofu-Gudur Sign Language|Mofu-Gudur]] in Cameroon.

A [[village sign language]] is a local indigenous language that typically arises over several generations in a relatively insular community with a high incidence of deafness, and is used both by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community, who have deaf family and friends.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |chapter-format=

[[Deaf-community sign language]]s, on the other hand, arise where deaf people come together to form their own communities. These include school sign, such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as [[Bamako Sign Language]], which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, as in the case of ASL.

Both contrast with [[speech taboo|speech-taboo]] languages such as the various [[Aboriginal Australian sign languages]], which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf. It is doubtful whether most of these are languages in their own right, rather than manual codes of spoken languages, though a few such as [[Yolngu Sign Language]] are independent of any particular spoken language. Hearing people may also develop sign to communicate with speakers of other languages, as in [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]; this was a contact signing system or [[pidgin]] that was evidently not used by deaf people in the Plains nations, though it presumably influenced home sign.

[[Language contact]] and [[creole language|creolization]] is common in the development of sign languages, making clear family classifications difficult&nbsp;– it is often unclear whether lexical similarity is due to borrowing or a common parent language, or whether there was one or several parent languages, such as several village languages merging into a Deaf-community language. Contact occurs between sign languages, between sign and spoken languages ([[contact sign]], a kind of pidgin), and between sign languages and [[gesture|gestural systems]] used by the broader community. One author has speculated that [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], a village sign language of Ghana, may be related to the "gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa", in vocabulary and [[areal feature]]s including prosody and phonetics.<ref>Frishberg (1987). See also the classification of [[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann]] (1991) for the general issue of jargons as prototypes in sign language genesis.</ref>

[[File:Lao sign language 025.jpg|thumb|Young students learn some words of [[Lao sign language]] from Suliphone, a deaf artist. This was one of several activities at a school book party sponsored by Big Brother Mouse, a literacy project in [[Laos]] where Suliphone works.]]
* [[British Sign Language|BSL]], [[Auslan]] and [[NZSL]] are usually considered to be a language known as [[BANZSL]]. [[Maritime Sign Language]] and [[South African Sign Language]] are also related to BSL.<ref>See Gordon (2008), under nsr {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nsr |title=Maritime Sign Language |accessdate=2011-06-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014547/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nsr |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }} and sfs {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sfs |title=South African Sign Language |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921104537/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sfs |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}.</ref>
* [[Danish Sign Language]] and its descendants [[Norwegian Sign Language]] and [[Icelandic Sign Language]] are largely mutually intelligible with [[Swedish Sign Language]]. [[Finnish Sign Language]] and [[Portuguese Sign Language]] derive from Swedish SL, though with local admixture in the case of mutually unintelligible Finnish SL.{{clarify|date=September 2014}} Danish SL has French SL influence and Wittmann (1991) places them in that family, though he proposes that Swedish, Finnish, and Portuguese SL are instead related to [[British Sign Language]].
* [[Indian Sign Language]] ISL is similar to [[Pakistani Sign Language]]. (ISL fingerspelling uses both hands, similarly to British Sign Language.).
* [[Japanese Sign Language]], [[Taiwanese Sign Language]] and [[Korean Sign Language]] are thought to be members of a [[Japanese Sign Language family]].<ref>Fischer, Susan D. ''et al.'' (2010). "Variation in East Asian Sign Language Structures" in {{Google books|xI0uqGyrsN8C|''Sign Languages,'' p. 499.|page=499}}</ref>
* [[French Sign Language family]]. There are a number of sign languages that emerged from [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), or are the result of language contact between local community sign languages and LSF. These include: [[French Sign Language]], [[Italian Sign Language]], [[Quebec Sign Language]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Irish Sign Language]], [[Russian Sign Language]], [[Dutch Sign Language]] (NGT), [[Spanish Sign Language]], [[Mexican Sign Language]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS)]], [[Catalan Sign Language]], [[Ukrainian Sign Language]], [[Austrian Sign Language]] (along with its twin [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and its offspring [[Czech Sign Language]]) and others.
** A subset of this group includes languages that have been heavily influenced by American Sign Language (ASL), or are regional varieties of ASL. [[Bolivian Sign Language]] is sometimes considered a dialect of ASL. [[Thai Sign Language]] is a [[mixed language]] derived from ASL and the native sign languages of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and may be considered part of the ASL family. Others possibly influenced by ASL include [[Ugandan Sign Language]], [[Kenyan Sign Language]], [[Philippine Sign Language]] and [[Malaysian Sign Language]].
* [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) gave rise to [[Polish Sign Language]]; it also at least strongly influenced [[Israeli Sign Language]], though it is unclear whether the latter derives from DGS or from [[Austrian Sign Language]], which is in the French family.
* [[Lyons Sign Language]] may be the source of [[Flemish Sign Language]] (VGT) though this is unclear.
* According to an [http://www.sil.org/silesr/abstract.asp?ref=2005-026 SIL report], the sign languages of Russia, Moldova and Ukraine share a high degree of lexical similarity and may be dialects of one language, or distinct related languages. The same report suggested a "cluster" of sign languages centered around [[Czech Sign Language]], [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and [[Slovak Sign Language]]. This group may also include [[Romanian Sign Language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian Sign Language|Bulgarian]], and [[Polish Sign Language|Polish]] sign languages.
* Sign languages of [[Jordanian Sign Language|Jordan]], Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq (and possibly [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi Arabia]]) may be part of a [[sprachbund]], or may be one dialect of a larger [[Eastern Arabic Sign Language]].
* Known [[Language isolate#Sign language isolates|isolates]] include [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], [[Turkish Sign Language]], [[Kata Kolok]], [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and [[Providence Island Sign Language]].

The only comprehensive classification along these lines going beyond a simple listing of languages dates back to 1991.<ref>Henri Wittmann (1991). The classification is said to be typological satisfying Jakobson's condition of genetic interpretability.</ref> The classification is based on the 69 sign languages from the 1988 edition of [[Ethnologue]] that were known at the time of the 1989 conference on sign languages in Montreal and 11 more languages the author added after the conference.{{refn |Wittmann's classification went into Ethnologue's database where it is still cited.<ref>{{cite web |editor1=Simons, Gary F. |editor2=Charles D.

The 2013 version (17th edition) of [[Ethnologue]] is now up to 137 sign languages.}}

In his classification, the author distinguishes between primary and auxiliary sign languages<ref>Wittmann adds that this taxonomic criterion is not really applicable with any scientific rigor: Auxiliary sign languages, to the extent that they are full-fledged natural languages (and therefore included in his survey) at all, are mostly used by the deaf as well, and some primary sign languages (such as ASL and [[Adamorobe Sign Language]]) have acquired auxiliary usages.</ref> as well as between single languages and names that are thought to refer to more than one language.<ref>Wittmann includes in this class [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] (at least 14 different languages), [[Monastic sign language]], Thai Hill-Country sign languages (possibly including languages in Vietnam and Laos), and [[Sri Lankan sign languages]] (14 deaf schools with different sign languages).</ref> The prototype-A class of languages includes all those sign languages that seemingly cannot be derived from any other language.<ref name=pro-A>These are [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], [[Armenian Sign Language]], [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]], Hindu [[mudra]], the [[Monastic sign languages]], [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]], [[Plains Indian Sign Language]], [[Urubú-Kaapor Sign Language]], [[Chinese Sign Language]], [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] (Pakistani SL is said to be R, but Indian SL to be A, though they are the same language), [[Japanese Sign Language]], and maybe the various [[Thai Hill-Country sign languages]], [[French Sign Language]], [[Lyons Sign Language]], and [[Mayan sign languages|Nohya Maya Sign Language]]. Wittmann also includes, bizarrely, Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphs.</ref> Prototype-R languages are languages that are remotely modelled on a prototype-A language (in many cases thought to have been French Sign Language) by a process Kroeber (1940) called "[[stimulus diffusion]]".<ref name=pro-R>These are [[Providencia Island Sign Language|Providencia Island]], [[Kod Tangan Bahasa Malaysia]] (manually signed Malay), [[German Sign Language|German]], [[Ecuadorian Sign Language|Ecuadoran]], [[Salvadoran Sign Language|Salvadoran]], [[Gestuno]], [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language|Indo-Pakistani]] (Pakistani SL is said to be R, but Indian SL to be A, though they are the same language), [[Kenyan Sign Language|Kenyan]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian]], [[Spanish Sign Language|Spanish]], [[Nepali Sign Language|Nepali]] (with possible admixture), [[Penang Sign Language|Penang]], [[Rennellese Sign Language|Rennellese]], [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi]], the various [[Sri Lankan sign languages]], and perhaps BSL, [[Peruvian Sign Language|Peruvian]], [[Tijuana Sign Language|Tijuana]] (spurious), [[Venezuelan Sign Language|Venezuelan]], and [[Nicaraguan Sign Language|Nicaraguan]] sign languages.</ref> The families of [[BANZSL|BSL]], [[German Sign Language|DGS]], [[Japanese Sign Language|JSL]], [[French Sign Language|LSF]] (and possibly [[Lyons Sign Language|LSG]]) were the products of [[creolization]] and [[relexification]] of prototype languages.<ref>Wittmann's references on the subject, besides his own work on [[creolization]] and [[relexification]] in spoken languages, include papers such as Fischer (1974, 1978), Deuchar (1987) and Judy Kegl's pre-1991 work on creolization in sign languages.</ref> Creolization is seen as enriching overt morphology in sign languages, as compared to reducing overt morphology in spoken languages.<ref>Wittmann's explanation for this is that models of acquisition and transmission for sign languages are not based on any typical parent-child relation model of direct transmission which is inducive to variation and change to a greater extent. He notes that sign creoles are much more common than vocal creoles and that we can't know on how many successive creolizations prototype-A sign languages are based prior to their historicity.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}</ref>

=== Typology ===
{{See also|Linguistic typology}}

Linguistic typology (going back to [[Edward Sapir]]) is based on word structure and distinguishes [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] classes such as [[Agglutination|agglutinating]]/concatenating, [[Inflexion|inflectional]], polysynthetic, incorporating, and isolating ones.

Sign languages vary in word-order typology. For example, [[Austrian Sign Language]], [[Japanese Sign Language]] and [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] are [[Subject-object-verb]] while [[ASL]] is [[Subject-verb-object]]. Influence from the surrounding spoken languages is not improbable.

Sign languages tend to be incorporating classifier languages, where a classifier handshape representing the object is incorporated into those transitive verbs which allow such modification. For a similar group of intransitive verbs (especially motion verbs), it is the subject which is incorporated. Only in a very few sign languages (for instance [[Japanese Sign Language]]) are agents ever incorporated. in this way, since subjects of intransitives are treated similarly to objects of transitives, incorporation in sign languages can be said to follow an ergative pattern.

Brentari<ref name="Brentari1998">Brentari, Diane (1998): A prosodic model of sign language phonology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349</ref><ref>Brentari, Diane (2002): Modality differences in sign language phonology and morphophonemics. In: Richard P. Meier, Kearsy Cormier, and David Quinto-Pozos (eds.), 35–36; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349</ref> classifies sign languages as a whole group determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, one sign) can express several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine the direction of the verb's movement (inflection).

Another aspect of typology that has been studied in sign languages is their systems for [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]].<ref>Ulrike Zeshan, Cesar Ernesto Escobedo Delgado, Hasan Dikyuva, Sibaji Panda, and Connie de Vos. 2013. Cardinal numerals in rural sign languages: Approaching cross-modal typology. Linguistic Typology 17: 357–396.</ref> Typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages.

=== Acquisition ===
{{See also|Language acquisition}}

Children who are exposed to a sign language from birth will acquire it, just as hearing children acquire their native spoken language.<ref>{{cite book|last=Emmorey|first=Karen|title=Language, Cognition, and the Brain|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ}}</ref>

The Critical Period hypothesis suggests that language, spoken or signed, is more easily acquired as a child at a young age versus an adult because of the plasticity of the child's brain. In a study done at the University of McGill, they found that American Sign Language users who acquired the language natively (from birth) performed better when asked to copy videos of ASL sentences than ASL users who acquired the language later in life. They also found that there are differences in the grammatical morphology of ASL sentences between the two groups, all suggesting that there is a very important critical period in learning signed languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition and The Deaf Child's Language Comprehension: A Psycholinguistic Approach|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel|date=|website=ACFOS|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201072124/http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|archivedate=2017-12-01|df=}}</ref>

The acquisition of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When a word that always has a particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects are attached to the word but don’t have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Advances in the Sign Language Development of Deaf Children|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cary, NC|isbn=978-0-19-803996-9|pages=262–290|author=Reilly, Judy|editor1=Brenda Schick |editor2=Marc Marschack |editor3=Patricia Elizabeth Spencer |chapter=How Faces Come to Serve Grammar: The Development of Nonmanual Morphology in American Sign Language}}</ref>

=== Written forms ===
{{anchor|Notation}}<!-- [[Sign language notation]] redirects here -->
Sign languages do not have a traditional or formal written form. Many deaf people do not see a need to write their own language.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hopkins | first1 = Jason | year = 2008 | title = Choosing how to write sign language: a sociolinguistic perspective | url = | journal = [[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]] | volume = 192 | issue = 192| pages = 75–90 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.2008.036}}</ref>

Several ways to represent sign languages in written form have been developed.

* [[Stokoe notation]], devised by Dr. [[William Stokoe]] for his 1965 ''Dictionary of American Sign Language'',<ref name="StokoeWilliam">Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg. 1965. ''A dictionary of American sign language on linguistic principles''. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press</ref> is an abstract [[phonemic]] notation system. Designed specifically for representing the use of the hands, it has no way of expressing facial expression or other non-manual features of sign languages. However, his was designed for research, particularly in a dictionary, not for general use.
* The [[Hamburg Notation System]] (HamNoSys), developed in the early 1990s, is a detailed phonetic system, not designed for any one sign language, and intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than as a practical script.
* [[David J. Peterson]] has attempted to create a phonetic transcription system for signing that is [[ASCII]]-friendly known as the [http://dedalvs.free.fr/slipa.html Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet (SLIPA)].
* [[SignWriting]], developed by Valerie Sutton in 1974, is a system for representing sign languages phonetically (including [[mouthing]], facial expression and dynamics of movement). The script is sometimes used for detailed research, language documentation, as well as publishing texts and works in sign languages.
* [[si5s]] is another orthography which is largely phonemic. However, a few signs are [[logogram|logographs]] and/or [[ideograph]]s due to regional variation in sign languages.
* [[ASL-phabet]] is a system designed primarily for education of deaf children by Dr. [[Samuel James Supalla|Sam Supalla]] which uses a minimalist collection of symbols in the order of Handshape-Location-Movement. Many signs can be written the same way ([[homograph]]).

So far, there is no consensus regarding the written form of sign language.  Except for SignWriting, none are widely used. Maria Galea writes that SignWriting "is becoming widespread, uncontainable and untraceable. In the same way that works written in and about a well developed writing system such as the Latin script, the time has arrived where SW is so widespread, that it is impossible in the same way to list all works that have been produced using this writing system and that have been written about this writing system."<ref name="GaleaLinguistic">{{cite book

=== Sign perception ===
For a native signer, [[American Sign Language|sign]] [[Categorical perception|perception]] influences how the mind makes sense of their visual language experience. For example, a handshape may vary based on the other signs made before or after it, but these variations are arranged in perceptual categories during its development.  The mind detects handshape contrasts but groups similar handshapes together in one category.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Jill P.

When Deaf people constitute a relatively small proportion of the general population, Deaf communities often develop that are distinct from the surrounding hearing community.<ref name="WollLadd2003">{{citation

These Deaf communities are very widespread in the world, associated especially with sign languages used in urban areas and throughout a nation, and the cultures they have developed are very rich.

One example of sign language variation in the Deaf community is [[Black ASL]]. This sign language was developed in the Black Deaf community as a variant during the American era of segregation and racism, where young Black Deaf students were forced to attend separate schools than their white Deaf peers.<ref>McCaskill, C. (2011). The hidden treasure of Black ASL: its history and structure. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet University Press.</ref>

=== Use of sign languages in hearing communities ===
On occasion, where the prevalence of deaf people is high enough, a deaf sign language has been taken up by an entire local community, forming what is sometimes called a "village sign language"<ref name="ZeshanDeVos2012">{{cite book

* [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], [[Ghana]] 
* [[Mayan Sign Language#Yucatec Mayan Sign Language|Yucatec Maya Sign Language]], [[Mexico]] 
In such communities deaf people are generally well integrated in the general community and not socially disadvantaged, 
so much so that it is difficult to speak of a separate "Deaf" community.<ref name="WollLadd2003" />

Many [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] arose in a context of extensive speech taboos, such as during mourning and initiation rites. They are or were especially highly developed among the [[Warlpiri Sign Language|Warlpiri]], [[Warumungu people|Warumungu]], [[Dieri]], [[Kaytetye people|Kaytetye]], [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]], and [[Warlmanpa language|Warlmanpa]], and are based on their respective spoken languages.

A [[pidgin]]{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=What is the evidence that it was a pidgin?}} sign language arose among tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in the [[Great Plains]] region of [[North America]] (see [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]). It was used by hearing people to communicate among tribes with different spoken [[language]]s, as well as by deaf people. There are especially users today among the [[Crow tribe|Crow]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]. Unlike Australian Aboriginal sign languages, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages.
In the 1500s, a Spanish expeditionary, [[Cabeza de Vaca]], observed natives in the western part of modern-day [[Florida]] using sign language,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and in the mid-16th century [[Francisco de Coronado|Coronado]] mentioned that communication with the [[Tonkawa]] using signs was possible without a translator.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Whether or not these gesture systems reached the stage at which they could properly be called languages is still up for debate. There are estimates indicating that as many as 2% of Native Americans are seriously or completely deaf, a rate more than twice the national average.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Signs may also be used by hearing people for [[manual communication]] in secret situations, such as hunting, in noisy environments, underwater, through windows or at a distance.

=== Legal recognition ===
{{Main|Legal recognition of sign languages}}
Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. Sarah Batterbury has argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C. E. Batterbury. 2012. ''Language Policy'' 11:253–272.</ref>

=== Telecommunications ===
[[File:Deaf or HoH person at his workplace using a Video Relay Service to communicate with a hearing person via a Video Interpreter and sign language SVCC 2007 Brigitte SLI + Mark.jpg|thumb|right|A deaf person using a remote VRS interpreter to communicate with a hearing person]]

One of the first demonstrations of the ability for [[telecommunication]]s to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]'s [[videophone]] (trademarked as the "Picturephone") was introduced to the public at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]&nbsp;– two deaf users were able to freely communicate with each other between the fair and another city.<ref name="BellLabs">Bell Laboratories RECORD (1969) [http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf A collection of several articles on the AT&T Picturephone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623215926/http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf |date=2012-06-23 }} (then about to be released) Bell Laboratories, Pg.134–153 & 160–187, Volume 47, No. 5, May/June 1969;</ref> However, video communication did not become widely available until sufficient bandwidth for the high volume of video data became available in the early 2000s.

The Internet now allows deaf people to talk via a [[video link]], either with a special-purpose [[videophone]] designed for use with sign language or with "off-the-shelf" [[videotelephony|video services]] designed for use with broadband and an ordinary computer [[webcam]].  The [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|special videophones]] that are designed for sign language communication may provide better quality than 'off-the-shelf' services and may use data compression methods specifically designed to maximize the intelligibility of sign languages. Some advanced equipment enables a person to remotely control the other person's video camera, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera better to understand the signing.

=== Interpretation ===
{{Main|Language interpretation#Sign language}}
[[File:2017 Woodstock 022 Język migowy.jpg|thumb|A [[Polish Sign Language]] interpreter at the [[Przystanek Woodstock]] in 2017]]
In order to facilitate communication between deaf and hearing people, sign language interpreters are often used.  Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[syntax]], different from any spoken language.

The interpretation flow is normally between a sign language and a spoken language that are customarily used in the same country, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and spoken French in France, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish in Spain, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and spoken English in the U.K., and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and spoken English in the US and most of anglophone Canada (since BSL and ASL are distinct sign languages both used in English-speaking countries), etc. Sign language interpreters who can translate between signed and spoken languages that are not normally paired (such as between LSE and English), are also available, albeit less frequently.

With recent developments in [[artificial intelligence]] in [[computer science]], some recent deep learning based [[machine translation of sign languages|machine translation algorithms]] have been developed which automatically translate short videos containing sign language sentences (often simple sentence consists of only one clause) directly to written language.<ref>{{cite conference |last=Huang |first=Jie |last2=Zhou |first2=Wengang |last3=Zhang |first3=Qilin |last4=Li |first4=Houqiang |last5=Li |first5=Weiping |title=Video-based Sign Language Recognition without Temporal Segmentation |conference=32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18), Feb. 2-7, 2018, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA |date=2018-01-30 |url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329054531/https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-29 |df= |arxiv=1801.10111 }}</ref>

=== Remote interpreting ===

[[File:Video interpreter.svg|thumb|upright|left|Video interpreter sign used at VRS/VRI service locations]]
{{Main|Video remote interpreting|Video relay service}}

Interpreters may be physically present with both parties to the conversation but, since the technological advancements in the early 2000s, provision of interpreters in remote locations has become available.  In [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI), the two clients (a sign language user and a hearing person who wish to communicate with each other) are in one location, and the interpreter is in another. The interpreter communicates with the sign language user via a video telecommunications link, and with the hearing person by an audio link. VRI can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available.

However, VRI cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With [[video relay service]] (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients to talk to each other on the phone through the interpreter.

=== Interpretation on television ===
[[File:Red de museos para la atencion a personas con discapacidad.webm|thumb|Video about access to cultural institutions in Mexico, with Mexican sign language interpretation and captions in Spanish]]

Sign language is sometimes provided for [[television program]]mes. The signer usually appears in the bottom corner of the screen, with the programme being [[broadcasting|broadcast]] full size or slightly shrunk away from that corner. Typically for [[press conference]]s such as those given by the [[Mayor of New York City]], the signer appears to stage left or right of the public official to allow both the speaker and signer to be in frame at the same time.

[[Paddy Ladd]] initiated deaf programming on [[United Kingdom|British]] television in the 1980s and is credited with getting sign language on television and enabling deaf children to be educated in sign.<ref>{{cite news | first=Raekha | last=Prasad | title=Sound and Fury | date=2003-03-19 | publisher= | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | work=Guardian Unlimited | pages= | accessdate=2008-01-30 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910210203/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | archivedate=2014-09-10 | df= }}</ref>

In traditional analogue broadcasting, many programmes are repeated, often in the early hours of the morning, with the signer present rather than have them appear at the main broadcast time.<ref name="RNID">{{cite web |url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television/ |title=Sign Language on Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |publisher=RNID |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003132/http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}</ref>  This is due to the distraction they cause to those not wishing to see the signer.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} On the BBC, many programmes that broadcast late at night or early in the morning are signed. Some emerging [[television]] technologies allow the viewer to turn the signer on and off in a similar manner to [[subtitles]] and [[closed captioning]].<ref name="RNID"/>

Legal requirements covering sign language on television vary from country to country. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Broadcasting Act 1996]] addressed the requirements for blind and deaf viewers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/sign_language_dtt/introduction.asp.html |title=ITC Guidelines on Standards for Sign Language on Digital Terrestrial Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423180334/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/sign_language_dtt/introduction.asp.html |archivedate=2007-04-23 |df= }}</ref> but has since been replaced by the [[Communications Act 2003]].

=== Language endangerment ===
As with any spoken language, sign languages are also vulnerable to becoming [[Endangered languages|endangered]]. For example, a sign language used by a small community may be endangered and even abandoned as users [[Language shift|shift]] to a sign language used by a larger community, as has happened with [[Hawai'i Sign Language]], which is almost extinct except for a few elderly signers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/hps|title=Did you know Hawai'i Sign Language is critically endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|access-date=2016-02-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307065744/http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/hps|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sl_dDVctycgC|title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195139778|language=en|quote=The language is considered to be endangered. 9,600 deaf people in Hawaii now use American Sign Language with a few local signs for place-names and cultural items.}}</ref> Even national sign languages can be endangered; for example, New Zealand Sign Language is losing users.<ref>{{cite

== Communication systems similar to sign language ==
There are a number of communication systems that are similar in some respects to sign languages, while not having all the characteristics of a full sign language, particularly its grammatical structure. Many of these are either precursors to natural sign languages or are derived from them.

=== Manual codes for spoken languages ===
{{Main|Manually coded language}}

When Deaf and Hearing people interact, signing systems may be developed that use signs drawn from a natural sign language but used according to the grammar of the spoken language. In particular, when people devise one-for-one sign-for-word correspondences between spoken words (or even [[morphemes]]) and signs that represent them, the system that results is a manual code for a spoken language, rather than a natural sign language. Such systems may be invented in an attempt to help teach Deaf children the spoken language, and generally are not used outside an educational context.

=== "Baby sign language" with hearing children ===
{{Main|Baby sign language}}

It has become popular for hearing parents to teach signs (from ASL or some other sign language) to young hearing children.  Since the muscles in babies' hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths, signs can be a beneficial option for better communication.<ref>Taylor-DiLeva, Kim. Once Upon A Sign : Using American Sign Language To Engage, Entertain, And Teach All Children, p. 15. Libraries Unlimited, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 29 Feb. 2012.</ref>  Babies can usually produce signs before they can speak.  This reduces the confusion between parents when trying to figure out what their child wants.  When the child begins to speak, signing is usually abandoned, so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language.

This is in contrast to hearing children who grow up with Deaf parents, who generally acquire the full sign language natively, the same as Deaf children of Deaf parents.

=== Home sign ===
{{Main|Home sign}}

Informal, rudimentary sign systems are sometimes developed within a single family. For instance, when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child, the child may develop a system of signs naturally, unless repressed by the parents. The term for these mini-languages is [[home sign]] (sometimes "home sign" or "kitchen sign").<ref>Susan Goldin-Meadow (Goldin-Meadow 2003, Van Deusen, Goldin-Meadow & Miller 2001) has done extensive work on home sign systems. [[Adam Kendon]] (1988) published a seminal study of the homesign system of a deaf [[Enga Province|Enga]] woman from the [[Papua New Guinea]] highlands, with special emphasis on [[iconicity]].</ref>

Home sign arises due to the absence of any other way to communicate. Within the span of a single lifetime and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.<ref>The one possible exception to this is Rennellese Sign Language, which has the [[ISO 639-3]] code [rsi]. It only ever had one deaf user, and thus appears to have been a home sign system that was mistakenly-accepted into the ISO 639-3 standard. It has been proposed for deletion from the standard. ({{cite web|title=Change Request Number: 2016-002|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2016-002.pdf|website=ISO 639-3|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2016-07-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128214659/http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2016-002.pdf|archivedate=2016-01-28|df=}})</ref>

=== Gestural theory of human language origins ===
{{Main|Origin of language#Gestural theory|l1=Origin of language § Gestural theory}}

One theory of the evolution of human language states that it developed first as a gestural system, which later shifted to speech.<ref>Hewes (1973), Premack & Premack (1983), Kimura (1993), Newman (2002), Wittmann (1980, 1991)</ref> An important question for this gestural theory is what caused the shift to vocalization.<ref>Kolb & Whishaw (2003)</ref>
