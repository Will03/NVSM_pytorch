'''Stratificational linguistics''' is a view of linguistics advocated by [[Sydney Lamb]]. His theories advocate that language usage and production is stratificational in nature.

Specifically, that there are separate 'strata' or levels in the brain used for language. Each level provides actualization or 'realization' for the next higher level, and the elements on its level are similar to each other. Several strata are involved in the production of a sound from an initial idea.

Some strata include:

*[[Phoneme]] as the unit on the [[phonemic]] stratum.
*[[Lexeme]] as a unit on the [[Lexicon|lexical]] stratum.
*[[Morpheme]] as the unit on the [[morphemic]] stratum.
*[[Sememe]] as the unit on the [[semantic]] stratum.
