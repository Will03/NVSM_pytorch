'''Patois''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|t|w|ɑː}}<small>, pl. same or</small> {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|t|w|ɑː|z}})<ref name="oed">{{OED|patois}}</ref> is speech or language that is considered [[nonstandard dialect|nonstandard]], although the term is not formally defined in [[linguistics]]. As such, ''patois'' can refer to [[pidgin]]s, [[creole language|creoles]], [[dialect]]s, or [[vernacular]]s, but not commonly to [[jargon]] or [[slang]], which are vocabulary-based forms of [[Cant (language)|cant]].

In colloquial usage of the term, especially in [[France]], class distinctions are implied by the very meaning of the term, since in French, ''patois''  refers to any [[sociolect]] associated with uneducated rural classes, in contrast with the [[dominant language|dominant]] [[prestige language]] ([[Standard French]]) spoken by the middle and high classes of cities, or as used in literature and formal settings (the '[[acrolect]]').

==Etymology==
The term ''patois'' comes from {{Lang-fro|patois}}, "local or regional dialect"<ref name="oed"/> (earlier "rough, clumsy, or uncultivated speech"), possibly from the verb ''{{Lang-fro|patoier|label=none}}'', "to treat roughly", from ''{{Lang-fro|pate|label=none}}'' "paw",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/patois|title=patois|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref> from [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]] {{Lang-odt|*patta|label=none}} paw, "sole of the foot" + ''[[wikt:-ois|-ois]]'', a [[pejorative suffix]]. The language sense may have arisen from the notion of a clumsy or rough manner of speaking.

==Examples==
In [[France]] and other [[Francophone]] countries, ''patois'' has been used to describe non-standard [[French language|French]] and [[regional language|regional]] languages such as [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], since 1643, and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] after 1700, when the king [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] banned its use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/francophonie/Decret-interdiction-catalan1700.htm|title=Interdiction de la langue catalane, Louis XIV|last=|first=|date=|website=www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca|language=fr-CA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref>  The word assumes the view of such languages being backward, countrified, and unlettered, thus is considered by speakers of those languages as offensive when used by outsiders. [[Jean Jaurès]] said "one names ''patois'' the language of a defeated nation".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rleb07.free.fr/opinions/vecteur.html|title=Do you speak french?

Many of the [[vernacular]] forms of [[English language|English]] spoken in the [[Caribbean]] are also referred to as ''patois''. It is noted especially in reference to Jamaican Patois from 1934. [[Jamaican Patois]] language comprises words of the native languages of the many ethnic and cultural groups within the Caribbean including Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Amerindian, and English along with several African languages. Some islands have creole dialects influenced by their linguistic diversity; French, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, German, Dutch, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese, and others. Patois are also spoken in [[Costa Rica]] and Caribbean islands such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Barbados]] and [[Guyana]] in South America.

Often these patois are popularly considered '[[broken English]]', or slang, but cases such as Jamaican Patois are classified with more correctness as a [[creole language]]; in fact, in the [[French West Indies|Francophone Caribbean]] the analogous term for local basilectal languages is ''créole'' (see also [[Jamaican English]] and [[Jamaican Creole]]). [[Antillean creole]], spoken on several present or formerly French islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]], includes vocabulary and grammar of African and [[Carib language|Carib]] origin, in addition to French. It dialects often contain folk-etymological derivatives of French words, for example ''{{Lang-fr|lavier|label=none}}'' ("river, stream") which is a syncopated variant of the standard French phrase {{Lang-fr|la rivière|label=none}} ("the river") but has been identified by [[folk etymology]] with {{Lang-fr|laver|label=none}}, "to wash"; therefore ''{{Lang-fr|lavier|label=none}}'' is interpreted to mean "a place to wash" (since such streams are often used for washing laundry).

Other examples of patois include [[Trasianka]], [[Sheng language|Sheng]], and [[Tsotsitaal]]. Patois has also been spoken for some [[Uruguay]] citizens, generally immigrants located in the south of Uruguay, mainly arriving from Italy and France, coming from [[Piedmont]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dedicaciontotal.udelar.edu.uy/adjuntos/produccion/742_academicas__academicaarchivo.pdf|title=Etnicidad y Lenguaje: La aculturación sociolingüística de los inmigrantes italianos en Motevideo|last=Barrios|first=Graciela|date=2008|website=Portal de la Universidad de la República - UCUR|publisher=Universidad de la República (Uruguay)|language=es-UY|trans-title=Ethnicity and Language [variety]: The sociolinguistic acculturation of Italian immigrants in Montevideo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>

Dominican, Grenadian, St. Lucian, Trinidadian and Venezuelan speakers of [[Antillean Creole]] call the language ''patois''.  It is also named {{Lang-es|Patuá|label=none}} in the [[Paria Peninsula]] of [[Venezuela]], and spoken since the eighteenth century by self-colonization of French people (from [[Corsica]]) and Caribbean people (from [[Martinique]], Saint Thomas, [[Trinidad]], [[Guadeloupe]], Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) who moved for [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]] production.

[[Macanese Patois]] is also known as ''Patuá'', and was originally spoken by the [[Macanese people|Macanese community]] of the former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony of [[Colony of Macau|Macau]].
