{{refimprove|date=April 2013}}[[File:Bedouin man with Fez.jpg|thumb| The Middle East contains a multitude of societies with different traditions regarding etiquette. [[Bedouin]]s like this young man wearing a [[Fez (clothing)|fez]] are traditionally renowned for their [[hospitality]].]]

Many matters of '''etiquette in the Middle East''' are connected to [[Islam]] as it is written in the [[Qur'an]] and how it has been traditionally understood and practiced throughout the centuries. Prescribed Islamic [[etiquette]] is referred to as [[Adab (behavior)|Adab]], and described as "refinement, good manners, morals, ethics, decorum, decency, humaneness and righteousness".<ref>Firmage, Edwin Brown and Weiss, Bernard G. and Welch, John W. ''Religion and Law''. 1990, page 202-3</ref>

As such, many points discussed in this article are applicable in other regions of the [[Islamic world]]. This holds especially true in [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim majority]] countries outside Middle East.

The Middle East is home to many people who follow faiths besides Islam. Most notable among them are the churches of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]], [[Copt]]s and other adherents of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], [[Maronites]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkites]]  other Catholics of the Eastern Rites as well as the Roman Rite, [[Zoroastrians]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], and various [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish denominations]].

In many cases, however, Muslims and non-Muslims in the Middle East will share characteristics, whether it is the prohibition against [[pork]] ordained by both [[Halal|Islamic]] and [[Kashrut|Jewish]] dietary restrictions, a preference for the beverage widely known elsewhere as "[[Turkish coffee]]", or knowledge of how to conduct business in a crowded [[souk]] without being cheated. It is a place where people with different beliefs often share the same traditions.

==Points of etiquette==
Although the Middle East is a large expanse of geography with a variety of customs, noting the following points of etiquette can be useful when dealing with people around the world who have been raised according to the traditions of the Middle East or, in some cases, Muslim societies elsewhere.
* Regarding head attire specifically, the etiquette at many Muslim holy sites requires that a [[headscarf]] -although it is not necessary and many if not most (men) do not wear it- or some other modest head covering be worn. For women, this might be a [[hijab]] and, for men, it might be a [[taqiyah (cap)]], [[turban]], or [[keffiyeh]]. A [[kippah]] or other head covering is expected for men in [[synagogue]]s and other places where Jews pray. Orthodox Christian sites might require the removal of hats by men but will expect women to cover their hair with a [[kerchief]] or [[veil]].
* Public displays of affection between people of the opposite sex, including between married people, are frowned upon everywhere more conservative values hold sway. Public displays of affection include activities as minor as hand-holding.<ref>{{Citation

* In many cases, people of the same sex holding hands while walking is considered an ordinary display of friendship without romantic connotations.<ref name="1,2122,,00">[http://www.dhl-usa.com/usgov/isr/culture/1,2122,,00.html Cultural Tips Per Audia AZ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527233457/http://www.dhl-usa.com/usgov/isr/culture/1,2122,,00.html |date=May 27, 2007 }}</ref>
* In a related point, many people in the Middle East claim a more modest amount of [[personal space]] than that which is usual elsewhere. Accordingly, it can seem rude for an individual to step away when another individual is stepping closer.<ref name="AR2006090701067">[http://www.budgettravel.com/bt-dyn/content/article/2006/09/07/AR2006090701067.html "Are You the Ugly American?"], Budget Travel</ref>
* Special respect is paid to older people in many circumstances. This can include standing when older people enter a room, always greeting older people before others present (even if they are better known to you), standing when speaking to one’s elders, kissing the head of an elderly relative, and serving older people first at a meal table.<ref name="airman/0406">{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/airman/0406/top10.shtml |title=Airman's Quarterly Spring 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2006 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502153202/http://www.af.mil/news/airman/0406/top10.shtml |archivedate=May 2, 2006 }}</ref>
[[File:Turkishcoffee.jpg|thumb|Hospitality is held in high regard throughout the Middle East. Some hosts take pride in the laborious preparation of what is known in [[Europe]] as “[[Turkish coffee]]”, grinding fresh-roasted [[coffee bean]]s to a fine powder, dissolving [[sugar]], and carefully regulating the heat to produce a result that meets exacting standards.]]
* In Iran, the "[[thumbs signal|thumbs up]]" gesture is considered an offensive insult.<ref name="airman/0406"/>
* Displaying the sole of one's foot or touching somebody with one's shoe is often considered rude. This includes sitting with one's feet or foot elevated. In some circumstances, shoes should be removed before entering a living room.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/crs/training_video/3to5_lan/transcript.html ''The First Three to Five Seconds: Understanding Arab and Muslim Americans''] Part II, USDOJ</ref>
* Many in the Middle East do not separate professional and personal life. Doing business revolves much more around personal relationships, family ties, trust, and honor. There is a tendency to prioritize personal matters above all else. It is therefore crucial that business relationships are built on mutual friendship and trust.<ref>[https://www.commisceo-global.com/blog/the-importance-of-business-relationships-in-the-middle-east The Importance of Business Relationships in the Middle East] </ref> According to the manners instructor [[Tami Lancut Leibovitz]] it might be common for an Israeli to ask others some personal questions about money or children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5122512|title=Can Israelis Learn to Have Better Manners?|last=|first=|date=|website=Haarertz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>
