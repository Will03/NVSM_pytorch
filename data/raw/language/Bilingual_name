A '''bilingual name''' is a [[personal name|name of a person]] that is spelled, if not pronounced, exactly the same in two languages. The speakers of a certain language usually have names that do not exist in another language. Even when the name has a common root or refers to the same historic or religious figure, different languages will spell and pronounce the name in a unique way. Thus a name with identical spelling in two languages may be of interest to parents of [[Third Culture Kids]], or [[Immigration|immigrants]].

==Examples==

===Differentiated spelling===

Children named after Alexander the Great, Saint Alexander, or any other Alexander are known as:
*Alexander in [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]].
*Alexandre in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].
*Alejandro in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], although commonly nicknamed ''Alex'', just like the female name Alejandra. Sandro/a is a common variation.
*Alexandre in [[French language|French]].
*Alexandre in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], commonly nicknamed ''Àlex''.
*Alessandro in [[Italian language|Italian]]. Female: Alessandra.
*Alexandru in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], shortened to Alex or Sandu.
*Alexand'r ([[Russian Cyrillic alphabet|Russian Cyrillic]]: Александр) in [[Russian language|Russian]], with Александра as a female name.
*Aleksandar ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: Александар) in [[Serbian language|Serbian]], often shortened to Aleksa (Алекса).
*İskender in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].
*Eskandar or Sekandar in [[Persian language|Persian]].
*([[definite article|al-]])Iskandar in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].
*Sándor in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].
*Santeri in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which is shortened from Aleksanteri.

Or variations thereof.

Some languages don't have this or other names. This is the case with many Chinese names that are not translatable into English.

Today, personal names are seen as untranslatable, but this has not always been the case.  [[George Walker Bush]] is referred to as George Walker Bush except in places where that name is impossible to render in the local alphabet.  For example, in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] the name is rendered [[:az:Corc Uolker Buş|Corc Uolker Buş]] because the [[Azerbaijani alphabet]] lacks the letters  [[J]] and [[W]], but has a letter [[ş]] which corresponds to the English "sh" sounds.

Historically, learned Europeans were often identified with [[Medieval Latin|Latinized]] versions of their names.  [[Christopher Columbus]] was published as Christophorus Columbus.  In Modern Italian, the same name is Cristoforo Colombo, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as Cristóvão Colombo (formerly Christovam Colom), and in Spanish as Cristóbal Colón.  Christophorus is the Latin version of the [[Greek language|Greek]] Χριστόφορος (Khristóphoros).

===Exotic naming===

Along with the comparatively slow changes in child-naming customs, many parents throughout the world give their child a name that does not have a common translation in their own language like [[Adabel Guerrero|Adabel Anahí]], sometimes as an aspirational gesture.
