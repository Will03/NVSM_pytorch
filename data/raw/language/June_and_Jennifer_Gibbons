'''June Gibbons''' (born 11 April 1963)<ref name="Morgan" /> and '''Jennifer Gibbons''' (11 April 1963 – 9 March 1993) were [[identical twin]]s who grew up in [[Wales]]. They became known as '''"The Silent Twins"''' since they only communicated with each other. They began writing works of fiction but later turned to crime. Both women were admitted to [[Broadmoor Hospital]] where they were held for 11 years.

== Childhood ==
June and Jennifer were the daughters of Caribbean immigrants Gloria and Aubrey Gibbons. Gloria was a housewife and Aubrey worked as a technician for the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=c5hNDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA65|title=Performance and Participation: Practices, Audiences, Politics|first1=Anna|last1=Harpin|first2=Helen|last2=Nicholson|date=7 October 2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=30 January 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Shortly after their birth in [[Yemen]], their family moved to [[Haverfordwest]], Wales. The twin sisters were inseparable and their particular high-speed [[Bajan Creole]] (pronounced Bay-Jan) made it difficult for people to understand them.

As the only [[black British|black]] children in the community, they were ostracized at school.<ref name="Morgan" /> This proved to be traumatic for the twins, eventually causing their school administrators to dismiss them early each day so that they might avoid bullying. Their language became even more [[idiosyncratic]] at this time. Soon it was unintelligible to others. Their language, or [[idioglossia]], qualified as an example of [[cryptophasia]], exemplified by the twins'  simultaneous actions, which often mirrored each other. Eventually the twins spoke to no one except each other and their younger sister Rose.<ref name="wallace">Marjorie Wallace ''The Silent Twins'', Prentice-Hall, October 1986. {{ISBN|5-551-73250-9}}</ref>

When the twins turned 14, a succession of therapists tried unsuccessfully to get them to communicate with others. They were sent to separate [[boarding school]]s in an attempt to break their isolation, but the pair became [[Catatonia|catatonic]] and entirely withdrawn when parted.<ref name="wallace"/>

==Creative expression==
When they were reunited, the two spent several years isolating themselves in their bedroom, engaged in elaborate plays with dolls. They created many plays and stories in a sort of soap opera style, reading some of them aloud on tape as gifts for their sister, Rose. Inspired by a pair of gift diaries on Christmas 1979, they began their writing careers. They sent away for a [[mail order]] course in creative writing, and each wrote several novels. Set primarily in the United States and particularly in [[Malibu, California]], the stories involve young men and women who exhibit strange and often criminal behaviour.<ref name="wallace"/>

In June's ''Pepsi-Cola Addict'', the high-school hero is seduced by a teacher, then sent away to a [[reformatory]] where a homosexual guard makes a play for him. In Jennifer's ''The Pugilist'', a physician is so eager to save his child's life that he kills the family dog to obtain its heart for a transplant. The dog's spirit lives on in the child and ultimately has its revenge against the father. Jennifer also wrote ''Discomania'', the story of a young woman who discovers that the atmosphere of a local disco incites patrons to insane violence. She followed up with ''The Taxi-Driver's Son'', a radio play called ''Postman and Postwoman'', and several short stories.

==Hospitalization==
Their novels were published by a [[self-publishing press]] called New Horizons, and they made many attempts to sell short stories to magazines, but were unsuccessful. A brief fling with some American boys, the sons of a [[US Navy]] serviceman, led nowhere. The girls committed a number of crimes including [[arson]], which led to their being admitted to [[Broadmoor Hospital]], a high-security mental health hospital. They remained there for 14 years. June later blamed this lengthy sentence on their selective muteness: "'Juvenile delinquents get two years in prison... We got 12 years of hell because we didn't speak... We lost hope, really. I wrote a letter to [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]], asking her to get us out. But we were trapped."<ref name="dailymail2016">Claudia Joseph, "[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3526486/Sister-Silent-Twins-close-one-DIE-live.html EXCLUSIVE – The 'Silent Twins' who were so close one of them had to DIE so the other could survive: Sister of girls held in Broadmoor for eleven years reveals lifelong heartache caused by their sinister bond]". ''Daily Mail'', 13 April 2016, page found 11 February 2017.</ref> Placed on high doses of [[antipsychotic]] medications, they found themselves unable to concentrate; Jennifer apparently developed [[tardive dyskinesia]] (a neurological disorder resulting in involuntary, repetitive movements). Their medications were apparently adjusted sufficiently to allow them to continue the copious diaries they had begun in 1980, and they were able to join the hospital choir, but they lost most of their interest in creative writing.<ref name="wallace"/>

The case achieved some notice due to newspaper coverage by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' journalist [[Marjorie Wallace (SANE)|Marjorie Wallace]].<ref>{{Citation | title =The Silent Twins | journal = NPR | date = 8 May 2015 | url = https://www.npr.org/2015/05/08/405191622/the-silent-twins }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = We Two Made One | journal = [[The New Yorker]]  | date = 4 December 2000 | url = https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/12/04/we-two-made-one }}</ref> The British tabloid ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' gave a brief account of their story, headlined "Genius Twins Won't Speak" (an apparent reference to their having tested above average intelligence when being considered for Broadmoor Hospital).

The pair were also the subject of the 1986 television drama ''[[The Silent Twins (film)|The Silent Twins]]'', broadcast on BBC Two as part of its ''[[Screen Two]]'' series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/cdb0079565784ec8a6430e8a9a2936fc|title=Screen Two: The Silent Twins|date=19 January 1986|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 September 2017|work=BBC Genome}}</ref> and an ''Inside Story'' documentary ''Silent Twin – Without My Shadow'', which aired on BBC One in September 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/eda57dfce87846fca3eb3ee195fea354|title=Inside Story Silent Twin – Without My Shadow|date=22 September 1994|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 September 2017|work=BBC Genome}}</ref>

==Jennifer's death==
According to Wallace, the girls had a longstanding agreement that if one died, the other must begin to speak and live a normal life. During their stay in the hospital, they began to believe that it was ''necessary'' for one of them to die, and after much discussion, Jennifer agreed to make the sacrifice of her life.<ref name="wallace2003">Marjorie Wallace, [https://www.theguardian.com/iran/story/0,12858,997276,00.html The tragedy of a double life], London: ''[[The Observer]]'', 13 July 2003</ref> In March 1993, the twins were transferred from Broadmoor to the more open Caswell Clinic in [[Bridgend]], Wales. On arrival Jennifer could not be roused.<ref name="Morgan" /> She was taken to the hospital where she died soon after of acute [[myocarditis]], a sudden [[inflammation]] of the heart.<ref name="Morgan">{{Cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/stage-visual-arts/tragic-tale-of-twins-and-their-secret-world-1.1045865 |title=Tragic tale of twins and their secret world |last=Morgan |first=Kathleen |date=2 August 2010 |work=Herald Scotland |access-date=19 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517024140/http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/stage-visual-arts/tragic-tale-of-twins-and-their-secret-world-1.1045865 |archive-date=17 May 2015 |dead-url=yes}}</ref> There was no evidence of drugs or poison in her system, and her death remains a mystery.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/inquiry-into-death-of-silent-twin-1497079.html Inquiry into death of silent twin].

On the trip to Caswell, she had slept in June's lap with her eyes open.<ref name="dailymail2016"/><ref name="Wallace293"/> On a visit a few days later, Wallace recounted that June "was in a strange mood". She said, "I'm free at last, liberated, and at last Jennifer has given up her life for me".<ref name="Morgan" />

After Jennifer's death, June gave interviews with ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>Hilton Als (2000) "We Two Made One", ''[[The New Yorker]]''</ref> By 2008 she was living quietly and independently, near her parents in West Wales.<ref name="Wallace293">{{cite book|author=Marjorie Wallace|title=The Silent Twins|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780099586418|year=2008|page=293}}</ref> She was no longer monitored by psychiatric services, has been accepted by her community, and sought to put the past behind her.<ref name="Morgan" /> A 2016 interview with her sister Greta revealed that the family had been deeply troubled by the girls' incarceration. She blamed Broadmoor for ruining their lives and for neglecting Jennifer's health. She had wanted to file a lawsuit against Broadmoor, but Aubrey and Gloria refused, saying it would not bring Jennifer back.<ref name="dailymail2016"/>
