{{distinguish|text=the sociolinguistic term [[sprechbund]]}}
A '''sprachbund''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃpʁaːxbʊnt|lang}}, "federation of languages") – also known as a '''linguistic area''', '''area of linguistic convergence''', '''diffusion area''' or '''language crossroads''' – is a group of [[language]]s that have common features resulting from geographical proximity and [[language contact]]. They may be [[genetic relatedness of languages|genetically unrelated]], or only distantly related. Where genetic affiliations are unclear, the sprachbund characteristics might give a false appearance of relatedness. [[Areal feature]]s are common features of a group of languages in a sprachbund.

==History==
In a 1904 paper, [[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay]] emphasised the need to distinguish between language similarities arising from a genetic relationship (''rodstvo'') and those arising from [[language convergence|convergence]] due to language contact (''srodstvo'').<ref>{{citation

In a paper presented to the first [[International Congress of Linguists]] in 1928, he used a German [[calque]]  of this term, ''Sprachbund'', defining it as a group of languages with similarities in [[syntax]], morphological structure, cultural vocabulary and sound systems, but without systematic sound correspondences, shared basic morphology or shared basic vocabulary.<ref>{{citation

In contrast, a [[sprachraum]] (from German, "language area"), also known as a [[dialect continuum]], describes a group of genetically related [[dialect]]s spoken across a geographical area, differing in their genetic relationship only slightly between areas that are geographically close, and gradually decreasing in [[mutual intelligibility]] as distances increase.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Examples==
===The Balkans===
{{Main|Balkan sprachbund}}
The idea of areal convergence is commonly attributed to [[Jernej Kopitar]]'s description in 1830 of [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as giving the impression of "''nur eine Sprachform ... mit dreierlei Sprachmaterie''",<ref>Jernej K. Kopitar, “Albanische, walachische und bulgarische Sprache”, ''Wiener Jahrbücher der Literatur'' 46 (1830): 59–106.</ref> which has been rendered by [[Victor Friedman]] as "one grammar with the three lexicons".<ref>{{citation

The [[Balkan sprachbund]] comprises Albanian, Romanian, the [[South Slavic languages]] of the southern Balkans (Bulgarian, [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and to a lesser degree [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]), [[Greek language|Greek]], Balkan [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Romani language|Romani]]. All but one of these are [[Indo-European languages]] but from very divergent branches, and Turkish is a [[Turkic language]]. Yet they have exhibited several signs of grammatical convergence, such as avoidance of the [[infinitive]], [[future tense]] formation, and others. The same features are not found in other languages that are otherwise closely related, such as the other Romance languages in relation to Romanian, and the other Slavic languages such as Polish in relation to Bulgaro-Macedonian.<ref name="Thomason (2000)"/><ref name="Friedman (2000)"/>

===Indian subcontinent===
In a classic 1956 paper titled "India as a Linguistic Area", [[Murray Emeneau]] laid the groundwork for the general acceptance of the concept of a sprachbund. In the paper, Emeneau observed that the subcontinent's [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages]] shared a number of features that were not inherited from a common source, but were [[areal features]], the result of diffusion during sustained contact.<ref>{{citation

Emeneau specified the tools to establish that language and culture had fused for centuries on the Indian soil to produce an integrated mosaic of structural convergence of four distinct language families: [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Tibeto-Burman]]. This concept provided scholarly substance for explaining the underlying Indian-ness of apparently divergent cultural and linguistic patterns. With his further contributions, this area has now become a major field of research in language contact and convergence.<ref name="Thomason (2000)"/><ref>{{citation | last1=Emeneau | first1=Murray | last2=Dil | first2=Anwar | title=Language and Linguistic Area: Essays by Murray B.

===Mainland Southeast Asia===
The [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] is one of the most dramatic of linguistic areas in terms of the surface similarity of the languages involved, to the extent that early linguists tended to group them all into a single family, although the modern consensus places them into numerous unrelated families.  The area stretches from Thailand to China and is home to speakers of languages of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Hmong–Mien]] (or Miao–Yao), [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]], [[Austronesian]] (represented by [[Chamic]]) and [[Mon–Khmer]] families.<ref name="Enfield">{{citation
| title = Areal Linguistics and Mainland Southeast Asia | first = N.J. | last = Enfield | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | year = 2005
| pages = 181–206 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120406 | url = http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:57458:2/component/escidoc:57459/Enfield_2005_areal.pdf | postscript = . }}</ref>

Neighbouring languages across these families, though presumed unrelated, often have similar features, which are believed to have spread by diffusion.
A well-known example is the similar [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] systems in [[Sinitic languages]] (Sino-Tibetan), Hmong–Mien, [[Tai languages]] (Kadai) and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (Mon–Khmer).  Most of these languages passed through an earlier stage with three tones on most syllables (but no tonal distinctions on [[checked syllable]]s ending in a [[stop consonant]]), which was followed by a [[tone split]] where the distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants disappeared but in compensation the number of tones doubled. These parallels led to confusion over the classification of these languages, until [[André-Georges Haudricourt]] showed in 1954 that tone was not an invariant feature, by demonstrating that Vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other languages of the Mon–Khmer family, and proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin.<ref name="Enfield"/>

Similarly, the unrelated [[Khmer language|Khmer]] (Mon–Khmer), [[Cham language|Cham]] (Austronesian) and [[Lao language|Lao]] (Kadai) languages have almost identical vowel systems.
Many languages in the region are of the [[isolating languages|isolating]] (or analytic) type, with mostly monosyllabic morphemes and little use of [[inflection]] or [[affix]]es, though a number of Mon–Khmer languages have [[derivational morphology]].
Shared syntactic features include [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]s, [[OV language|object–verb order]] and [[topic–comment]] structure, though in each case there are exceptions in branches of one or more families.<ref name="Enfield"/>

===Northeast Asia===
Some linguists, such as [[Matthias Castrén]], [[Gustaf John Ramstedt|G. J. Ramstedt]], [[Nicholas Poppe]] and [[Pentti Aalto]] supported the idea that the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] families of Asia (and some small parts of Europe) are genetically related, in a controversial group they call [[Altaic languages|Altaic]]. [[Koreanic language|Koreanic]] and [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] languages, which are also hypothetically related according to some scholars like [[William George Aston]], Shōsaburō Kanazawa, [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel Martin]] and [[Sergei Starostin]], are sometimes included as part of the purported Altaic family. This latter hypothesis was supported by people including [[Roy Andrew Miller]], John C. Street and [[Karl Heinrich Menges]].
[[Gerard Clauson]], [[Gerhard Doerfer]], [[Juha Janhunen]], [[Stefan Georg]] and others dispute or reject this. A common alternative explanation for similarities between said-Altaic languages such as [[vowel harmony]] and [[agglutinative languages|agglutination]] is that they are due to areal diffusion.<ref>{{citation
