In [[etymology]], '''back-formation''' is the process of creating a new [[lexeme]] by removing actual or supposed [[affix]]es.<ref name="Crystal (2008)">Crystal, David. ''A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics, Sixth Edition'', Blackwell Publishers, 2008.</ref> The resulting [[neologism]] is called a ''back-formation'', a term coined by [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gLuThUMAc4IC|title=Funny Side of English|first=O. A.|last=Booty|date=24 August 2002|publisher=Pustak Mahal|accessdate=8 April 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> in 1889. ([[OED]] online preserves their first use of 'back formation' from 1889 in the definition of ''to burgle''.)<ref>{{cite web |url= https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/burgle |title=Oxford Dictionaries Definition of burgle in English |work=Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=20 April 2017}}</ref>

For example, the noun ''resurrection'' was borrowed from Latin, and the verb ''resurrect'' was then backformed hundreds of years later from it by removing the ''ion'' suffix. This segmentation of ''resurrection'' into ''resurrect'' + ''ion'' was possible because English had examples of Latinate words in the form of verb and verb+''-ion'' pairs, such as ''opine/opinion''. These became the pattern for many more such pairs, where a verb derived from a Latin supine stem and a noun ending in ''ion'' entered the language together, such as ''insert/insertion'', ''project/projection'', etc.

== Similar phenomena ==
Back-formation may be similar to the reanalyses or [[folk etymology|folk etymologies]] when it rests on an erroneous understanding of the morphology of the longer word. For example, the singular noun ''asset'' is a back-formation from the plural ''assets''. However, ''assets'' is originally not a plural; it is a [[loanword]] from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''asetz'' (modern French ''assez''). The ''-s'' was reanalyzed as a plural suffix.

Back-formation is different from [[Clipping (morphology)|clipping]]&nbsp;– back-formation may change the word's [[part of speech|class]] or meaning, whereas clipping creates shortened words from longer words, but does ''not'' change class or meaning of the word.

Words can sometimes acquire new lexical categories without any [[morphological derivation|derivational]] change in form (for example, ''[[ship]]'' was first a noun and later was used as a verb). That process is called [[Conversion (word formation)|conversion]] (or zero-derivation). Like back-formation, it can produce a new noun or a new verb, but it involves no back-forming.

== In English ==
Back-formation may be particularly common in English since many English words are borrowed from Latin, French and Greek, giving English a large range of common affixes. Many words with affixes have entered English, such as ''dismantle'' and ''dishevelled'', so it may be easy to believe that these are formed from roots such as ''mantle'' (meaning to put something together) and ''shevelled'' (meaning well-dressed) although these words have no history of existing in English.

Many words came into English by this route: ''Pease'' was once a [[mass noun]] but was reinterpreted as a [[English plural|plural]], leading to the back-formation ''pea''. The noun ''statistic'' was likewise a back-formation from the field of study ''[[statistics]]''.  In Britain, the verb ''burgle'' came into use in the nineteenth century as a back-formation from ''burglar'' (which can be compared to the [[North America]]n verb ''burglarize'' formed by suffixation).

Other examples are
* Noun "taxon", a unit of classification in [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], derived from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ''taxis'' (arrangement)+''nomia'' "distribution"
* Singular "[[sastruga]]", plural "sastrugi" (from Russian): new Latin-type singular "sastrugus" has been used sometimes
* Singular "[[syringe]]", from plural "syringes"; the original Greek singular is ''[[syrinx]]''
* Singular ''[[tamale]]'', from the plural ''tamales''; the original Spanish singular is ''tamal''.
* Verb "edit" from "editor"
* Verbs "euthanase" or "euthanize" from the noun "euthanasia".

The verb ''translate'' is a back formation from ''translation'', which is from Latin ''trans - lat'' + ''-io[n]''. ''Lat-'' is from the very irregular ([[suppletive]]) verb ''ferre'' 'to carry.' ''Translat-'' in Latin was merely a semi-adjectival form of ''transferre'' meaning '[something] having been carried across [into a new language]' (cf. ''transfer''). The result of the action ''transferre textum'' 'to translate a text' was a ''textus translatus'' 'a text that has been translated.' Thus the verb in English is really from a (semi-)adjectival form in Latin.

Even though many English words are formed this way, new coinages may sound strange, and are often used for humorous effect. For example, ''gruntled'' (from ''disgruntled'') is used only in humorous contexts, as when [[P. G. Wodehouse]] wrote, "I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled", or the character Turk in the American sitcom ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' told another character, "I don't disdain you! It's quite the opposite&nbsp;– I dain you."<ref>http://scrubs.mopnt.com/scripts/310.php</ref> As it happens, ''gruntle'' and ''dain'' are both attested much earlier, but not as antonyms of the longer forms.<ref name= "isbn0-19-861271-0">{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford|year=1993|isbn=0-19-861271-0}}</ref>

Back-formations frequently begin in colloquial use and only gradually become accepted. For example, ''enthuse'' (from ''enthusiasm'') is gaining popularity, though it is still generally considered nonstandard today.<ref>See "Discussion of enthuse," https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enthuse</ref>

The immense celebrations in Britain at the news of the relief of the [[Siege of Mafeking]] briefly created the verb ''to maffick'', meaning to celebrate both extravagantly and publicly. "Maffick" is a back-formation from ''Mafeking'', a place-name that was treated humorously as a [[gerund]] or [[participle]]. There are many other [[List of English back-formations|examples of back-formations in the English language]].

===Place names===
As English place names are often British, and hence the study of Celtic scholars, back-formations have occurred in many ways over the centuries due to English-speaking interpretations.  For example, the [[River Chelmer]] in Essex is named after the town of Chelmsford (''Chelmeresford'') which is derived from the Saxon personal name ''Cēolmǣr''.<ref name="Ekwall">{{Cite book|title=English River Names|author=Eilert Ekwall|date=1928|publisher=OUP|page=xli}}</ref>
