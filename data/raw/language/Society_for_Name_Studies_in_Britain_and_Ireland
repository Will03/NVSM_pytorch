The '''Society for Name Studies in Britain and Ireland''' (SNSBI) is a [[learned society]] for members with interests in [[proper name]]s, including [[Toponymy|place-names]], [[personal name]]s, and [[surname]]s relating to the [[British Isles]]. The Society's president is Carole Hough.

The SNSBI is the successor to the Council for Name Studies in [[British people|Great Britain]] and [[Irish people|Ireland]], which was set up in the 1960s to bring together [[scholar]]s who were working in the field of [[onomastics]] in the British Isles. Membership of the council was originally by invitation, but in the late 1980s it was felt an open society would be more appropriate. As a result, the SNSBI was formally inaugurated in November 1991.

The SNSBI took over the publication of the Council's [[Academic journal|journal]] ''Nomina''. It holds a day conference each autumn, as well as an annual weekend conference in spring. It has a [[website]] which provides details of future events and of the articles in past issues of ''Nomina''.
