{{about|the linguistic term||Bongo Bongo Land}}
'''Bongo-Bongo''' in [[linguistics]] is used as a name for an [[imaginary language]]. It is most commonly invoked in [[Etymology|etymological studies]] to conceptualize random similarities between unrelated languages.<ref name=Trask>[[Larry Trask|Trask, R.L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}</ref> It has also been used as a name for a [[constructed language]] invented by [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] as a teaching tool in linguistics.<ref name=NM>Murray, N. ''Writing Essays in English Language and Linguistics: Principles, Tips and Strategies for Undergraduates'' [[Cambridge University Press]] (2012) {{ISBN|978-0521128469}}</ref>

==Etymological studies==
Random similarities occur between related and unrelated languages and these are commonly disregarded in the academic study of etymology. The widespread habit of unscientific researches to look for such coincidental similarities and proclaim them as proof of genetic relationship has given rise to the term ''Bongo-Bongo approach'' or ''Bongo-Bongo effect''.<ref name=Trask/> For example, when comparing random [[Underlying representation|surface forms]] in [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (which are known to be unrelated languages), "pairings" such as ''hegi'' (Basque for "ridge") and ''hegy'' (Hungarian for "hill") are easily found but ultimately meaningless in terms of etymology without additional historical linguistic research and data.<ref name=Trask/>

==Anthropology==
The concept can also be found occasionally in [[anthropology]] where the ''Bongo-Bongo'' are sarcastically used as an imaginary tribe or ethnicity (or by extension, [[Bongo Bongo Land]]).<ref>Kippenberg, HG (ed) ''Concepts of Person in Religion and Thought (Religion and Reason, No 37)'' [[Walter de Gruyter|de Gruyter]] (1990) {{ISBN|978-3110121599}}</ref>
