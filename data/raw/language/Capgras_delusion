'''Capgras delusion''' is a [[psychiatric disorder]] in which a person holds a [[delusion]] that a friend, spouse, parent, or other close family member (or pet) has been replaced by an identical [[impostor]]. The Capgras delusion is classified as a [[delusional misidentification syndrome]], a class of delusional beliefs that involves the misidentification of people, places, or objects.<ref name="Ellis 149–156">{{Cite journal|title = Capgras delusion: a window on face recognition|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136466130001620X|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date = 2001-04-01|pages = 149–156|volume = 5|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01620-X|pmid = 11287268|first = Hadyn D.|last = Ellis|first2 = Michael B.|last2 = Lewis}}</ref> It can occur in [[acute (medical)|acute]], transient, or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] forms.

==Signs and symptoms==
The following two case reports are examples of the Capgras delusion in a psychiatric setting:

{{quote|Mrs. D, a 74-year-old married housewife, recently discharged from a local hospital after her first psychiatric admission, presented to our facility for a [[second opinion (medicine)|second opinion]]. At the time of her admission earlier in the year, she had received the diagnosis of atypical psychosis because of her belief that her husband had been replaced by another unrelated man. She refused to sleep with the impostor, locked her bedroom and door at night, asked her son for a gun, and finally fought with the police when attempts were made to hospitalise her. At times she believed her husband was her long deceased father. She easily recognised other family members and would misidentify her husband only.

{{quote|Diane was a 28-year-old single woman who was seen for an evaluation at a [[day hospital]] program in preparation for discharge from a psychiatric hospital. This was her third psychiatric admission in the past five years. Always shy and reclusive, Diane first became psychotic at age 23. Following an examination by her physician, she began to worry that the doctor had damaged her internally and that she might never be able to become pregnant. The patient's condition improved with neuroleptic treatment but deteriorated after discharge because she refused medication. When she was admitted eight months later, she presented with delusions that a man was making exact copies of people—"screens"— and that there were two screens of her, one evil and one good. The diagnosis was schizophrenia with Capgras delusion. She was disheveled and had a bald spot on her scalp from self-mutilation.

The following case is an instance of the Capgras delusion resulting from a [[neurodegenerative disease]]:

{{quote|Fred, a 59-year-old man with a high school qualification, was referred for neurological and neuropsychological evaluation because of cognitive and behavioural disturbances. He had worked as the head of a small unit devoted to energy research until a few months before. His past medical and psychiatric history was uneventful. [...] Fred's wife reported that about 15 months from onset he began to see her as a "double" (her words). The first episode occurred one day when, after coming home, Fred asked her where Wilma was. On her surprised answer that she was right there, he firmly denied that she was his wife Wilma, whom he "knew very well as his sons' mother", and went on plainly commenting that Wilma had probably gone out and would come back later. [...] Fred presented progressive cognitive deterioration characterised both by severity and fast decline. Apart from [Capgras disorder], his neuropsychological presentation was hallmarked by language disturbances suggestive of frontal-executive dysfunction. His cognitive impairment ended up in a severe, all-encompassing frontal syndrome.

==Causes==
It is generally agreed {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} that the Capgras delusion has a complex and organic basis {{Definition needed|I am unclear on the word organic in this context.  Please provide reference to similar resources or examples.|date=January 2017}}, and can be better understood by examining neuroanatomical damage associated with the syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Young A.

J. | year = 1993 | title = Face-processing impairments and the Capgras delusion | url = | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 162 | issue = 5| pages = 695–698 | doi=10.1192/bjp.162.5.695}}</ref>

The first clues to the possible causes of the Capgras delusion were suggested by the study of brain-injured patients who had developed [[prosopagnosia]]. In this condition, patients are unable to [[face perception|recognize faces consciously]], despite being able to recognize other types of visual objects. However, a 1984 study by Bauer showed that even though conscious face recognition was impaired, patients with the condition showed [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] arousal (measured by a [[galvanic skin response]] measure) to familiar faces,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(84)90040-X |last1=Bauer |first1=R.M. |title=Autonomic recognition of names and faces in prosopagnosia: a neuropsychological application of the Guilty Knowledge Test |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=457–69 |year=1984 |pmid=6483172}}</ref> suggesting that there are two pathways to face recognition—one conscious and one unconscious.

In a 1990 paper published in the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'', psychologists [[Hadyn Ellis]] and Andy Young hypothesized that patients with Capgras delusion may have a "mirror image" or [[Dissociation (neuropsychology)|double dissociation]] of [[prosopagnosia]], in that their conscious ability to recognize faces was intact, but they might have damage to the system that produces the automatic emotional arousal to familiar faces.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.157.2.239 |last1=Ellis |first1=H.D. |last2=Young |first2=A.W. |title=Accounting for delusional misidentifications |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=157 |pages=239–48 |date=August 1990 |pmid=2224375 |issue=2}}</ref> This might lead to the experience of recognizing someone while feeling something was not "quite right" about them.
In 1997, [[Hadyn Ellis]] and his colleagues published a study of five patients with Capgras delusion (all diagnosed with schizophrenia) and confirmed that although they could consciously recognize the faces, they did not show the normal automatic emotional arousal response.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0150  |last1=Ellis |first1=H.D. |last2=Young |first2=A.W. |last3=Quayle |first3=A.H. |last4=De Pauw |first4=K.W. |title=Reduced autonomic responses to faces in Capgras delusion |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences  |volume=264 |pages=1085–92 |year=1997 |issue=1384 |pmid=9263474 |pmc=1688551}}</ref> The same low level of autonomic response was shown in the presence of strangers. Young (2008) has theorized that this means that patients with the disease experience a "loss" of familiarity, not a "lack" of it.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2008.01.006 |pmid=18314350 |last=Young |first=G. |title=Capgras delusion: An interactionist model |journal=Consciousness and Cognition |volume=17 |pages=863–76 |date=September 2008 |issue=3}}</ref> Further evidence for this explanation comes from other studies measuring [[Galvanic Skin Response|galvanic skin responses]] (GSR) to faces. A patient with Capgras delusion showed reduced GSRs to faces in spite of normal face recognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Automatic without autonomic responses to familiar faces: Differential components of covert face recognition in a case of Capgras delusion|journal = Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date = 2000-11-01|issn = 1354-6805|pages = 255–269|volume = 5|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/13546800050199711|first = Hadyn D.|last = Ellis|first2 = Michael B.|last2 = Lewis|first3 = Hamdy F.|last3 = Moselhy|first4 = Andrew W.|last4 = Young}}</ref> This theory for the causes of Capgras delusion was summarised in ''[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]]''.<ref name="Ellis 149–156"/>

[[William Hirstein]] and [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] reported similar findings in a paper published on a single case of a patient with Capgras delusion after brain injury.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0062 |last1=Hirstein |first1=W. |last2=Ramachandran |first2=V.S. |title=Capgras syndrome: a novel probe for understanding the neural representation of the identity and familiarity of persons |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=264 |pages=437–444 |year=1997 |pmid=9107057 |pmc=1688258 |issue=1380}}</ref> Ramachandran portrayed this case in his book ''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramachandran |first=V.S. |authorlink= Vilayanur S.

More specifically, he emphasizes the disconnection between the [[amygdala]] and the [[inferotemporal cortex]].<ref name=vs />

In 2010, William Hirstein revised this theory to explain why a person with Capgras syndrome would have the particular reaction of not recognizing a familiar person.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The misidentification syndromes as mindreading disorders | journal = Cognitive Neuropsychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 233–60 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20017039 | doi = 10.1080/13546800903414891 | author1 = Hirstein | first1 = W | url = https://philpapers.org/rec/HIRTMS }}</ref> Hirstein explained the theory as follows:<ref>[http://sciencedevil.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/we-all-have-capgras-delusions-they-prevent-divorce Science Satire Serpent web site]</ref>

{{quote|my current hypothesis on Capgras, which is a more specific version of the earlier position I took in the 1997 article with V. S. Ramachandran. According to my current approach, we represent the people we know well with hybrid representations containing two parts. One part represents them externally: how they look, sound, etc. The other part represents them internally: their personalities, beliefs, characteristic emotions, preferences, etc. Capgras syndrome occurs when the internal portion of the representation is damaged or inaccessible. This produces the impression of someone who looks right on the outside, but seems different on the inside, i.e., an impostor. This gives a much more specific explanation that fits well with what the patients actually say. It corrects a problem with the earlier hypothesis in that there are many possible responses to the lack of an emotion upon seeing someone.}}

Furthermore, Ramachandran suggests a relationship between the Capgras syndrome and a more general difficulty in linking successive [[episodic memories]] because of the crucial role emotion plays in creating memories. Since the patient could not put together memories and feelings, he believed objects in a photograph were new on every viewing, even though they normally should have evoked feelings (e.g., a person close to him, a familiar object, or even himself).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Hirstein William |author2=Ramachandran V.S. | year = 1997 | title = Capgras syndrome: a novel probe for understanding the neural representation of the identity and familiarity of persons | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 264 | issue = 1380| page = }}</ref> Others like Merrin and Silberfarb (1976) <ref name=merrin /> have also proposed links between the Capgras syndrome and deficits in aspects of memory. They suggest that an important and familiar person (the usual subject of the delusion) has many layers of visual, auditory, tactile, and experiential memories associated with them, so the Capgras delusion can be understood as a failure of object constancy at a high perceptual level.

Most likely, more than an impairment of the automatic emotional arousal response is necessary to form Capgras delusion, as the same pattern has been reported in patients showing no signs of delusions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.1995.7.4.425 |pmid=23961902 |last1=Tranel |first1=D. |last2=Damasio |first2=H. |last3=Damasio |first3=A. |title=Double dissociation between overt and covert face recognition |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=7 |pages=425–432 |year=1995 |issue=4}}</ref> Ellis suggested that a second factor explains why this unusual experience is transformed into a delusional belief; this second factor is thought to be an impairment in reasoning, although no definitive impairment has been found to explain all cases.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/ppp.2001.0007 |last1=Davies |first1=M. |last2=Coltheart |first2=M. |last3=Langdon |first3=R. |last4=Breen |first4=N. |title=Monothematic delusions: Towards a two-factor account |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, and Psychology |volume=8 |pages=133–158 |year=2001 |issue=2}}</ref> Many have argued for the inclusion of the role of patient phenomenology in explanatory models of the Capgras syndrome in order to better understand the mechanisms that enable the creation and maintenance of delusional beliefs.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Young G | year = 2008 | title = Restating the role of phenomenal experience in the formation and maintenance of the capgras delusion | url = | journal = Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 177–189 | doi=10.1007/s11097-007-9048-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Ratcliffe M | year = 2008 | title = The phenomenological role of affect in the Capgras delusion | url = | journal = Continental Philosophy Review | volume = 41 | issue = 2| pages = 195–216 | doi=10.1007/s11007-008-9078-5}}</ref>

Capgras syndrome has also been linked to [[reduplicative paramnesia]], another delusional misidentification syndrome.  Since these two syndromes are highly associated, it has been proposed that they affect similar areas of the brain and therefore have similar neurological implications.  Reduplicative paramnesia is understood to affect the frontal lobe and thus it is believed that Capgras syndrome is also associated with the frontal lobe.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Alexander M. P. |author2=Stuss D. T. |author3=Benson D. F. | year = 1979 | title = Capgras syndrome A reduplicative phenomenon | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 334 | doi=10.1212/wnl.29.3.334}}</ref> Even if the damage is not directly to the frontal lobe, an interruption of signals between other lobes and the frontal lobe could result in Capgras syndrome.<ref name=Josephs/>

==Diagnosis==
Because it is a rare and poorly understood condition, there is no definitive way to diagnose the Capgras delusion. Diagnosis is primarily made on psychological evaluation of the patient, who is most likely brought to a psychologist's attention by a family member or friend believed to be an imposter by the person under the delusion.

==Treatment==
Treatment has not been well studied and so there is no evidence-based approach.<ref name=Barrelle2018/>  Treatment is generally therapy, often with support of [[antipsychotic]] medication.<ref name=Barrelle2018>{{cite book |last1=Barrelle |first1=A |last2=Luauté |first2=JP |title=Capgras Syndrome and Other Delusional Misidentification Syndromes. |journal=Frontiers of Neurology and Neuroscience |date=2018 |volume=42 |pages=35–43 |doi=10.1159/000475680 |pmid=29151089|isbn=978-3-318-06088-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bourget |first1=D |title=Forensic considerations of substance-induced psychosis. |journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |date=2013 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=168–73 |pmid=23771929}} {{open access}}</ref>

==History==
Capgras syndrome is named after [[Joseph Capgras]] (1873–1950), a [[France|French]] [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] who first described the disorder in 1923 in his paper co-authored by Jean Reboul-Lachaux,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Capgras |first1=J. |last2=Reboul-Lachaux |first2=J. |title=Illusion des " sosies " dans un délire systématisé chronique |journal=Bulletin de la Société Clinique de Médicine Mentale |volume=2 |pages=6–16 |year=1923 |url=http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/histmed/medica/cote?epo1250}}</ref> on the case of a French woman, "Madame Macabre," who complained that corresponding "doubles" had taken the places of her husband and other people she knew.<ref name=vs /> Capgras and Reboul-Lachaux first called the syndrome "l'illusion des sosies", which can be translated literally as "the illusion of look-alikes."<ref>[http://psychologie-m-fouchey.psyblogs.net/public/neuropsychoMarlene/l%C3%A9sions%20droites/syndrome_capgras.pdf "Approche clinique du syndrome de Capgras ou « illusion des sosies » illustrée par un cas"], Gaël Le Vacon, 2006; rough translation: "Clinical approach to Capgras syndrome or 'illusion of doubles' illustrated by a case"</ref>

The Capgras syndrome was initially considered a purely psychiatric disorder, the delusion of a double seen as symptomatic of schizophrenia, and purely a female disorder (though this is now known not to be the case<ref name=merrin>{{cite journal |author1=Merrin E. L. |author2=Silberfarb P. M. | year = 1976 | title = The Capgras phenomenon | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = 8| page = 965 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1976.01770080083008}}</ref>) often noted as a symptom of hysteria. Most of the proposed explanations initially following that of Capgras and Reboul-Lachaux were psychoanalytical in nature. It was not until the 1980s that attention was turned to the usually co-existing organic brain lesions originally thought to be essentially unrelated or accidental. Today, the Capgras syndrome is understood as a neurological disorder, in which the delusion primarily results from organic brain lesions or degeneration.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Draaisma|first=Douwe|date=September 2009|title=Echos, Doubles, and Delusions: Capgras Syndrome in Science and Literature|journal=Draaisma, Douwe|volume=43|issue=3|page=429|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/45583333/echos-doubles-delusions-capgras-syndrome-science-literature|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}</ref>
