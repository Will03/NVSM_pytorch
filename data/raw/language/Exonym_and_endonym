An '''exonym''' or '''xenonym''' is an external name for a [[geographical place]], a group of people, an individual person, or a language or [[dialect]]. It is a common name used only outside the place, group, or [[linguistic community]] in question. An '''endonym''' or '''autonym''' is an internal name for a [[geographical place]], a group of people, or a language or [[dialect]]. It is a common name used only inside the place, group, or [[linguistic community]] in question; it is their name for themselves, their homeland, or their language.

For instance, ''Germany'' is the English language exonym, {{wikt-lang|fr|Allemagne}} is the French language exonym, and {{wikt-lang|de|Deutschland}} is the endonym for the same country in Europe.

[[Marcel Aurousseau]], an Australian [[geography|geographer]], first used the term exonym in his work ''The Rendering of Geographical Names'' (1957).<ref>Marcel Aurousseau, 1957, ''The Rendering of Geographical Names'', London, Hutchinson, pp. 2–3, and; Kelsey B. Harder, 1996, "The term", in: Ernst Eichler & Walter de Gruyter (eds), ''Namenforschung/Name Studies/Les noms propres. 2. Halbband+Registerband'', Berlin, Walter de Gruyter, p. 1012.</ref> The term ''endonym'' was devised subsequently as an [[antonym]] for the term ''exonym''.

==Etymology==
All four of the terms (exonym, endonym, autonym and xenonym) are from the [[List of Greek and Latin roots in English|Greek root word]] {{transl|grc|ónoma}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ὄνομα}}), 'name'. The prefixes are from the Greek {{transl|grc|éndon}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ἔνδον}}), 'within'; {{transl|grc|autós}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|αὐτός}}), 'self'; {{transl|grc|éxō}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ἔξω}}), 'out'; and {{transl|grc|xénos}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ξένος}}), 'foreign'.

==Definitions==
[[wikt:exonym|Exonyms]] and [[wikt:endonym|endonyms]] can be names of places ([[wikt:toponym|toponym]]), ethnic groups ([[ethnonym]]), languages ([[wikt:glossonym|glossonym]]), or individuals ([[personal name]]).<ref>
"The names of monarchs, popes, and non-contemporary authors as well as place-names are commonly translated. Foreign names for geographic proper names are called exonyms. Fourment-Berni Canani (1994) discusses the (im)possibility of translating proper names. He gives the examples of the place-names Venice and London. The Italian city Venezia has been renamed Venice in English and Venise in French. A city in the American state California is also called Venice, but this name is not changed into Venezia in Italian and Venise in French. Similarly, the English city London has been renamed Londres in French and Londra in Italian. However, the Canadian city called London is not translated into French and Italian in this way. Thus, as Fourment-Berni Canani concludes, a place-name can be translated if the place, as a unique referent, has already been renamed in the target language."

As pertains to geographical features, the [[United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names]] defines:
* '''Endonym''': Name of a geographical feature in an official or well-established language occurring in that area where the feature is located.
* '''Exonym''': Name used in a specific language for a geographical feature situated outside the area where that language is spoken, and differing in its form from the name used in an official or well-established language of that area where the geographical feature is located.<ref>[http://ungegn.zrc-sazu.si/ Working Group on Exonyms], United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN).</ref>

For example, ''[[India]]'', ''[[China]]'', ''[[Egypt]]'', and ''[[Germany]]'' are the [[English language|English]]-language exonyms corresponding to the endonyms ''[[Names for India|Bharat]]'', ''[[Names of China|中国]]'' (''Zhōngguó''), ''[[Names of Egypt|مَصر]]'' (''Masr''), and ''[[Names of Germany|Deutschland]]'', respectively. [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[German language|German]] are exonyms in English for the languages that are endonymously known as "中文" ("Zhōngwén"), "فارسی" ("Fārsi"), "Türkçe", "العَرَبِيَّة" ("al-Arabiyah"), and "Deutsch", respectively.

Exonyms may derive from different roots, as in the case of Germany for ''Deutschland'', or they may be [[cognate]] words which have diverged in [[pronunciation]] or [[orthography]], or they may be fully or partially translated (a [[calque]]) from the native language. For example, [[London]] (originally [[Latin Language|Latin]] ''Londinium'') is known by the cognate exonyms ''Londres'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[French language|French]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; ''Londino'' (Λονδίνο) in [[Greek Language|Greek]]; ''Londen'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; ''Londra'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]; ''Londër'' in Albanian; ''Londýn'' in [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]; ''Londyn'' in [[Polish language|Polish]]; ''Lundúnir'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]; ''Lontoo'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. An example of a translated exonym is the French name ''Pays-Bas'' for the [[Netherlands]], ''Nederland'' in Dutch, all of which mean "[[Terminology of the Low Countries|Low Countries]]".

Exonyms can also be divided into native and borrowed, i.e. from a third language. For example, Slovene uses the native exonyms ''Dunaj'' ([[Vienna]]) and ''Benetke'' ([[Venice]]), and the borrowed exonyms ''Kijev'' ([[Kiev]]) and ''Vilna'' ([[Vilnius]]), from Russian. A substantial proportion of English exonyms for places in continental Europe are borrowed (or adapted) from French; for example: [[Navarre]] ({{Lang-es|Navarra}}''/Nafarroa''), [[Belgrade]] (''{{lang-sr|Beograd}}''), [[Cologne]] ({{Lang-de|Köln}}), [[Munich]] ({{Lang-de|München}}), [[Prague]] ({{Lang-cz|Praha}}), [[Rome]] ({{Lang-it|Roma}}), [[Naples]] ({{Lang-it|Napoli}}), and [[Florence]] ({{Lang-it|Firenze}}).

== Tendencies in the development of exonyms ==
According to [[James A. Matisoff]], who introduced the term "autonym" into linguistics, "Human nature being what it is, exonyms are liable to be pejorative rather than complimentary, especially where there is a real or fancied difference in cultural level between [[ingroups and outgroups|the ingroup and the outgroup]]." For example, Matisoff notes ''Khang'' "an opprobrious term indicating mixed race or parentage" is the [[Palaung language|Palaung]] name for [[Jingpo people]] and the [[Jingpo language|Jingpo]] name for [[Chin peoples|Chin people]]; both the Jingpo and Burmese use the Chinese word ''yeren'' 野人 (literally "wild men") "savage; rustic people" as the name for [[Lisu people]].<ref>Matisoff, James A. (1986). "The languages and dialects of Tibeto-Burman: an alphabetic/genetic listing, with some prefatory remarks on ethnonymic and glossonymic complications." In John McCoy and Timothy Light, eds., [https://books.google.com/books?id=jdYUAAAAIAAJ Contributions to Sino-Tibetan Studies, presented to Nicholas C. Bodman], p 6. E.J. Brill.</ref>

Exonyms develop for places of significance for speakers of the language of the exonym. Consequently, many European capitals have English exonyms, e.g. [[Athens]] (Αθήνα/Athína), [[Belgrade]] (Београд/Beograd), [[Bucharest]] ({{Lang-ro|București}}), [[Brussels]] (Bruxelles, Brussel), [[Copenhagen]] ({{Lang-da|København}}), [[Lisbon]] ({{Lang-pt|Lisboa}}), [[Moscow]] ({{Lang-ru|Москва}}/Moskva), [[Prague]] (Praha), [[Rome]] (Roma), [[Vienna]] ({{Lang-de-AT|Wien}}), and [[Warsaw]] ({{Lang-pl|Warszawa}}), while for instance historically less prominent capitals [[Ljubljana]] and [[Zagreb]] do not (but do have exonyms in languages spoken nearby e.g. [[German language|German]]: Laibach and Agram, though "Agram" is old fashioned and not used any more). [[Madrid]], [[Berlin]], [[Oslo]], and [[Amsterdam]], with identical names in most major European languages, are exceptions.  Some European capitals might be considered partial exceptions in that whilst the spelling is the same across languages, the pronunciation can differ; thus [[Paris]] in English sees the 's' vocalised, whilst in Swedish [[Stockholm]] is pronounced with a more emphasised glottal stop which is missing in English.  For places considered to be of lesser significance, attempts to reproduce local names have been made in English since the time of the [[Crusades]]. [[Livorno]], to take an instance, was ''Leghorn'' because it was an Italian port essential to English merchants and, by the 18th century, to the British Navy; not far away, [[Rapallo]], a minor port on the same sea, never received an exonym.

In earlier times, the name of the first tribe or village encountered became the exonym for the whole people beyond. Thus the Romans used the tribal names ''Graecus'' (Greek) and ''Germanus'', the Russians used the village name of ''[[Chechen people|Chechen]]'', medieval Europeans took the tribal name ''[[Tatar]]'' as emblematic for the whole [[Mongol]]ic confederation (and then confused it with ''Tartarus'', a word for Hell, to produce ''[[Tatars|Tartar]]''), and the [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invaders were equated with the 500-years-earlier [[Hun]]nish invaders in the same territory, and were called ''Hungarians''.

The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invaders of the [[Roman Empire]] applied the word "[[Walha]]" to foreigners they encountered and this evolved in West Germanic languages as a generic name for all non-Germanic speakers; thence, the names [[Wallachia]], [[Vlachs]], [[Wallonia]], [[Walloons]], [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]], [[Wallasey]], [[Welche]] in Alsace-Lorraine, and even the Polish name for Italy, ''[[Italy|Włochy]]''.

==Usage==
During the late 20th century the use of exonyms often became controversial. Groups often prefer that outsiders avoid exonyms where they have come to be used in a [[pejorative]] way: for example, [[Romani people]] often prefer that term to exonyms such as ''Gypsy'' (from [[Egypt]]), and the French term ''bohémien, bohème'' (from [[Bohemia]]). People may also avoid exonyms for reasons of historical sensitivity, as in the case of German names for Polish and Czech places that at one time had been ethnically or politically German (e.g. [[Danzig/Gdańsk]] and Karlsbad/Karlovy Vary), and Russian names for locations once under Russian control (e.g. Kiev/Kyiv).

In recent years, [[Geography|geographers]] have sought to reduce the use of exonyms to avoid this kind of problem. For example, it is now common for Spanish speakers to refer to the [[Turkey|Turkish]] capital as [[Ankara]] rather than use the Spanish exonym ''Angora''. According to the [[United Nations]] Statistics Division, "Time has, however, shown that initial ambitious attempts to rapidly decrease the number of exonyms were over-optimistic and not possible to realise in the intended way. The reason would appear to be that many exonyms have become common words in a language and can be seen as part of the language’s cultural heritage."

In some situations the use of exonyms can be preferred. For instance, for multilingual cities such as [[Brussels]], which is known for its linguistic tensions between Dutch- and French-speakers, a neutral name may be preferred so as to not offend anyone. Thus an exonym such as Brussels in English could be used instead of favoring either one of the local names (Brussel in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]/[[Flemish]] and Bruxelles in [[French language|French]]).

Other difficulties with endonyms have to do with pronunciation, spelling and word category. The endonym may include sounds and spellings that are highly unfamiliar to speakers of other languages, making appropriate usage difficult if not impossible for an outsider. Over the years, the endonym may have undergone phonetic changes, either in the original language or the borrowing language, thus changing an endonym into an exonym, as in the case of ''Paris'', where the ''s'' was formerly pronounced in French. Another example is the endonym for the German city of [[Cologne]], where the [[Latin]] original of Colonia has evolved into ''Köln'' in German, while the Italian and Spanish exonym ''Colonia'' closely reflects the Latin original. In some cases no standardized spelling is available either because the language itself is unwritten (even unanalyzed) or because there are competing non-standard spellings. Use of a misspelled endonym is perhaps more problematic than the respectful use of an existing exonym. Finally, an endonym may be a plural noun and may not naturally extend itself to adjectival usage in another language, like English, which has a propensity to use the adjectives for describing culture and language. The attempt to use the endonym thus has a bizarre-sounding result.

The names for a country and a people are often different terms, which is a complication for an outsider, with a noticeable example being people from the Netherlands being called the Dutch by native English speakers.

As modern technology removes many of the barriers between peoples, it is increasingly becoming the case that younger people may be more familiar with an endonym than with its official exonym. For example, many Italian cities are now more famous for their football teams and [[Torino]] and [[Napoli]] are becoming more common than [[Turin]] and [[Naples]].

Sometimes the government of a country tries to endorse the use of an endonym instead of traditional exonyms outside the country:
* In 1782 [[Rama I|King Yotfa Chulalok]] of [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] moved the government seat from [[Bangkok Yai District|Thonburi Province]] to [[Phra Nakhon District|Phra Nakhon Province]]. In 1972 the Thai government merged Thonburi and Phra Nakhon, forming the new capital, Krungthep Mahanakhon. However, outside of Thailand, the capital retained the old name and is still called [[Bangkok]].
* In 1935 [[Reza Shah]] requested that foreign nations use the name [[Iran]] rather than Persia in official correspondence. The name of the country had internally been [[Name of Iran|Iran]] since the time of the [[Sassanid Empire]] (224–651), whereas the name Persia is descended from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Persis'' (Περσίς), referring to a single province which is officially known as [[Fars Province]].
* In 1949 the government of [[Siam]] changed the name to [[Thailand]], although the former name's adjective in English (''Siamese'') was retained as the name for the [[Siamese fighting fish|fish]], [[Siamese (cat)|cat]] and [[conjoined twins]].
* In 1972 the government of [[Ceylon]] (the word is the anglicized form of Portuguese ''Ceilão'') changed the name to [[Sri Lanka]], although the name Ceylon was retained as the name for [[Ceylon tea|that type of tea]].
* In 1985 the government of [[Côte d'Ivoire]] requested that the country's French name be used in all languages instead of exonyms such as ''Ivory Coast'', so that Côte d'Ivoire is now the official English name of that country in the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Olympic Committee]] (see [[Côte d'Ivoire#Names|Name of Côte d'Ivoire]]). In most non-Francophone countries, however, the French version has not entered common parlance.
* In 1989 the government of Burma requested that the English name of the country be [[Myanmar]], with ''Myanma'' as the adjective of the country and ''Bamar'' as the name of the inhabitants (see [[Names of Burma]]).
* The Government of India officially changed the English name of Bombay to [[Mumbai]] in November 1995.
* The [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] government maintains that the capital of Ukraine should be spelled ''Kyiv'' in English because the traditional English exonym [[Kiev]] was derived from the Russian name ''Kiyev'' (Киев) (see [[Kiev#Name|Name of "Kiev"]]).
* The [[Belarus]]ian government argues that the endonym ''Belarus'' should be used in all languages. The result has been rather successful in English, where the former exonym ''Byelorussia''/''Belorussia'', still used with reference to the [[Byelorussian SSR|Soviet Republic]], has virtually died out; in other languages exonyms like Danish [[:da:Hviderusland|Hviderusland]], Dutch [[:nl:Wit-Rusland|Wit-Rusland]], Estonian [[:et:Valgevene|Valgevene]], Faroese [[:fo:Hvítarussland|Hvítarussland]], Finnish [[:fi:Valko-Venäjä|Valko-Venäjä]], German [[:de:Weißrussland|Weißrussland]], Greek Lefkorosía ([[:el:Λευκορωσία|Λευκορωσία]]), Hungarian [[:hu:Fehéroroszorság|Fehéroroszország]], Icelandic [[:is:Hvíta-Rússland|Hvíta-Rússland]], Swedish [[:sv:Vitryssland|Vitryssland]], Turkish [[:tr:Beyaz Rusya|Beyaz Rusya]], Chinese [[:zh:白俄罗斯|白俄罗斯]] (all literally 'White Russia'), or French [[:fr:Biélorussie|Biélorussie]], Italian [[:it:Bielorussia|Bielorussia]], Portuguese [[:pt:Bielorrússia|Bielorrússia]], and Spanish [[:es:Bielorrusia|Bielorrusia]] are still much more common than ''Belarus''.
* In 2006 the South Korean national government officially changed the Chinese name of its capital, [[Seoul]], from the exonym ''Hancheng'' (漢城/汉城) to ''Shou'er'' (首爾/首尔). This use has now been made official within the [[People's Republic of China]].

Following the declaration in 1979 of [[Hanyu Pinyin]] spelling as the standard romanisation of Chinese, many Chinese endonyms have successfully replaced English exonyms, {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} especially city and most province names in mainland China, e.g. [[Beijing]] (北京 ''Běijīng''), [[Guangdong]] (广东 ''Guǎngdōng'') (province), [[Qingdao]] (青岛 ''Qīngdǎo''), although older English exonyms are sometimes used in certain contexts – e.g. Peking ([[Peking duck|duck]], [[Peking opera|opera]], etc.), Canton, etc. (In some cases the traditional English exonym is based on a local Chinese dialect instead of Mandarin, in the case of [[Xiamen]], where the name Amoy is closer to the [[Hokkien]] pronunciation.)  In the case of ''Beijing'', the adoption of the exonym by media outlets quickly gave rise to a [[hyperforeignism|hyperforeignized]] pronunciation, with the result that many English speakers actualize the ''j'' in ''Beijing'' as [ʒ].<ref>The Reality of Linguistic Rules, eds. Susan D. Lima, Roberta Corrigan, Gregory K. Iverson, 1994, p. 80</ref>

==Exonyms as pejoratives==
Matisoff wrote, "A group's autonym is often egocentric, equating the name of the people with 'mankind in general,' or the name of the language with 'human speech'."<ref>Matisoff (1986), p. 5.</ref> For example, various Native American autonyms are sometimes explained to English readers as having literal translations of "original people" or "normal people", with implicit contrast to other first nations as not original or not normal. Exonyms often describe others as "foreign-speaking", "non-speaking" or "nonsense-speaking". The classic example is the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] term for the Germans, ''Nemtsi'', possibly deriving from a plural of ''nemy'' ("mute"): standard etymology has it that the [[Slav]]ic peoples referred to their Germanic neighbors as "mutes" because their language was unintelligible. The term survives to this day in the [[Russian language|Russian]] ''nemtsy'' (''немцы''), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''nemtsi'' (''немци''), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ''nimtsi'' (''німці''), [[Polish language|Polish]] ''Niemcy'', [[Czech language|Czech]] ''Němci'', [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''Nijemci/Nemci'' (''Нијемци/Немци''), [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] ''Njemci'' (''Њемци''), as well as in the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''Német'' and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''Nemţi'' (both adopted from the Slavic), and even in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Nemçe'' and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-Nimsa'' (النمسا). The Turkish was adapted from the Slavic, and the Arabic from the Turkish, the words in both cases referring specifically to [[Austria]].

One of the more prominent theories regarding the origin of the term "[[Slav]]" suggests that it comes from the Slavic root ''slovo'' (hence "[[Slovenia]]," "[[Slovakia]]"), meaning "word" or "speech". In this context, the [[Slavs]] are describing Germanic people as "mutes"&mdash;in contrast to themselves, "the speaking ones".

Another example of such development is the exonym "[[Sioux]]", an abbreviated form of ''Nadouessioux'', derived most likely from a Proto-Algonquian term, *-a·towe·, "foreign-speaking".

Two millennia earlier, the Greeks thought that all non-Greeks were uncultured and so called them "[[barbarian]]s," which eventually [[Berber (name)|gave rise]] to the exonym "[[Berber people|Berber]]".

While the [[Irish language|Irish]] words for [[England]] and its people are ''Sasana'' and ''Sasanach'' ("Saxons"), the word for the [[English language]] is ''Béarla'', which derives ultimately from a word meaning "lips". In [[Old Irish]], this word was applied to any foreign language, but by the medieval period it had come to be used exclusively for the English language.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

== Confusion with renaming ==
Exonyms and endonyms must not be confused with the results of [[geographical renaming]] as in the case of [[Saint Petersburg]], which became Petrograd (Петроград) in 1914, Leningrad (Ленинград) in 1924, and Saint Petersburg (Санкт-Петербург ''Sankt-Peterbúrg'') again in 1991. In this case, although ''St Petersburg'' has a German etymology, it was never a German exonym for the city between 1914 and 1991, just as [[New Amsterdam|Nieuw Amsterdam]], the Dutch name of [[New York City]] until 1664, is not its Dutch exonym.

Old place names that have become outdated after renaming may afterwards still be used as [[historicisms]]. For example, even today one would talk about the [[Siege of Leningrad]], not the Siege of St. Petersburg, because at that time (1941–1944) the city was called Leningrad. Likewise, one would say that [[Immanuel Kant]] was born in Königsberg in 1724, not in [[Kaliningrad]] (Калининград), as it has been called since 1946.

Although the pronunciation for several names of Chinese cities such as [[Beijing]] and [[Nanjing]] has not changed for quite some while in [[Mandarin Chinese]], they were called [[Peking]] and [[Nanjing|Nanking]] in English due to the confusion brought about by the older [[Chinese postal romanization]] convention, which was used for transcribing Chinese place names before [[Pinyin]] became the official [[romanization]] method for [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] in the 1970s. Nonetheless, many older English speakers still refer to the cities by their older English names and even today they are often used in naming things associated with the cities like [[Peking opera]], [[Peking duck]], and [[Peking University]] to give them a more antiquated or more elegant feel. Like for Saint Petersburg, the historical event called the [[Nanking Massacre]] (1937) uses the city's older name because that was the name of the city at the time of occurrence. Likewise, many Korean cities like [[Busan]] and [[Incheon]] (formerly [[Pusan]] and [[Incheon|Inchǒn]] respectively) also underwent changes in spelling due to changes in romanization, even though the Korean pronunciations have largely stayed the same.

Sometimes, however, historical names are deliberately not used because of nationalist tendencies to linguistically lay claim to a city's past. As a case in point, the [[:sk:Bratislavský mier (1805)|Slovak Wikipedia article]] on the 1805 [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] does not use any of the city's names then in use (the Hungarian ''[[Pozsony]]'', the Slovak ''Prešporok'' or the German ''Pressburg''), but today's name ''Bratislava'', which became the city's name in 1919.

The name [[Madras]], now [[Chennai]], may be [[Chennai#Etymology|a special case]]. When the city was first settled by Englishmen, in the early 17th century, both names were in use. Possibly they referred to different villages which were fused into the new settlement. In any case, Madras became the exonym, while more recently, Chennai became the endonym.

Likewise, [[Istanbul]] (İstanbul in Turkish) is still called Constantinople (Κωνσταντινούπολη) in Greek, although the name was changed in Turkish to disassociate the city from its Greek past between 1923 and 1930 (the name Istanbul itself [[Names of Istanbul#İstanbul|derives from a Medieval Greek phrase]]<ref>"The Names of Istanbul". Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi. 5. Ciltli. 1994.</ref>). Prior to Constantinople, the city was known in Greek as [[Byzantium|Byzantion]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Βυζάντιον, [[Latin]]: {{lang|la|Byzantium}}), named after its mythical founder, [[Byzas]].
