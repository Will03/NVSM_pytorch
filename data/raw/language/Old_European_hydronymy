==Geography==
Krahe writes in A1, chapter III, "Introducing preface" Number 2<ref name=Krahe/>{{rp|32}} that the old European hydronomy extended from Scandinavia to South Italy, from Western Europe including the British Isles to the Baltic countries. Of the three Mediterranean peninsulas, Italy was most completely included, whilst the Balkan Peninsula was only scarcely covered. He writes that what he presents for hydronomy also applies to mountains and ranges of mountains, and continues with "Karpaten" and "Karawanken", certainly within the Slavic settlement area, omitting the Bavarian/Austrian "Karwendel" though.<ref name=Krahe/>{{rp|12}} This area is associated with the spread of the later "Western" Indo-European dialects, the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], and [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] branches.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Notably exempt is [[Greece]].

Krahe located the geographical nucleus of this area as stretching from the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] across [[Western Poland]] and [[Germany]] to the [[Swiss plateau]] and the upper [[Danube]] north of the [[Alps]], while he considered the Old European river names of southern France, Italy and Spain to be later imports, replacing "[[Aegean languages|Aegean]]-[[Pelasgian]]" and [[Iberian language|Iberian]] substrates,<ref name=Krahe />{{rp|81}} corresponding to [[Italic peoples|Italic]], [[Celtiberians|Celtic]] and [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] "invasions" from about 1300 BC.

==Origins of names==
Krahe continues in III A 5, "Geographic Area and age of the paleoeuropean hydronomy" that the overwhelming majority of river and stream names originate from words which in the historical single languages cannot be found or cannot be found any more.<ref name=Krahe />{{rp|77}} He uses mainly Indo-European roots to allow the river names in question to speak (rule 1) of which more than 10,000 are listed.

In III A 2, "Etymology and Semasiology of the paleoeuropean river names" Krahe states that the oldest strata are composed by prerequisites of nature and that the river names especially refer to the water itself (rule 2),<ref name=Krahe />{{rp|60}} and that words referring to humans and culture are newer. Both rules are important arguments for considering the old European hydronomy of southern France and the north of the Iberian Peninsula as a result of secondary implementation (A.1. number 3) due to a postulated immigration around 1300 BC.

In "Morphology of Paleoeuropean river names" III A1 number 3, Krahe concentrates on suffixes (simples and multiples) and distinguishes eleven different ones in a table.<ref name=Krahe />{{rp|62–63}} He attributes geographical (Central European vs. South European or Eastern), functional (for example affluent) or temporal (before or after a change of consonants or vowels) functions to the suffixes of the river names (Rule 3). For the temporal function he claims the existence of a system of phonetic changes (''Lautverschiebung''), however he does not include prefixes in his considerations.

Krahe's concentration on Indo-European roots and the omission of prefixes had serious negative consequences, because ever later focus was placed on those more than 10,000 roots, perhaps on [[old Irish]], but scarcely on [[Gaulish]] and actual Celtic languages or [[Baltic languages]] and completely leaving out [[Basque language|Basque]]. Delamarre later included for example under Gaulish ''dubron'' only rivers with "B" (or similar) leaving out other names, which Krahe would have called ''Schwundstufe'' = loss of a letter or with inversion of letters or both.

Krahe ignored the impact of Moorish occupation in Spain, which led to frequent combinations of Arab "prefixes" (always at the beginning) on Celtic "suffixes" as seen in [[Guadiana]] (Guadi = river and Anas = bayous, muddy, as it appears in [[Ptolemy]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Ptolemaios Handbuch der Geographie|editors= Alfred Stückelberg und Gerd Grasshoff|publisher= Schwabe|location= Basel| ISBN=978-3-7965-2148-5 |page=169}}</ref> The tables <comparison old European hydronyms> show that, in contradiction to Krahe's opinion, hydronyms (and toponyms) can in some cases very well be explained even by modern Irish, Welsh, or French and certainly by Gaulish.

==Krahe's influence on other scientists==
Krahe has influenced archaeologists, linguists and particularly experts in Celtic languages:

[[Marija Gimbutas]] (Lithuanian: Marija Gimbutiene) studied in [[Tübingen]], and received her doctorate of archeology in 1946 in the same department where Krahe lectured. Gimbutas developed the [[Kurgan]] theory.

[[Jürgen Untermann]], a disciple of Krahe with dissertation 1954 in Tübingen was professor for [[Comparative Linguistics]] at the [[University of Cologne]]. He was an [[epigraphy|epigraphist]] and Indoeuropeanist.

[[Antonio Tovar]], with preliminary studies in Berlin, later professor of the University of Salamanca, was professor for Comparative Linguistics in Tübingen from 1967 to 1979. Together with Manuel Agud and [[Koldo Mitxelena]] he prepared an unedited etymological dictionary of the [[Basque language]]. Mitxelena (in English editions he appears as Luis Michelena) was only the creator of the modern Basque language.

==Other authors==
Other authors with a focus on or touching on the topic old European hydronomy are:

Xavier Delamarre is a French linguist whose standard work is ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (2nd revised and augmented edition Paris, 2003), with the subtitle "Une approche linguistique du vieux-celtique continental". This is in fact the most comprehensive publication on [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] words. Slightly more than 800 terms appear in alphabetical order derived from Gaulish-Greek, Gaulish-Etruscan and Gaulish-Latin or solely Gaulish inscriptions, printed classical languages, coins and some terms of Celtic substrate in [[Occitan]]. He presents all cases of appearance of toponyms and hydronyms in question, cites authors and roots, showing alternatives, and classifies, if necessary, as uncertain or questionable. He shows all river name examples with prefixes. For example, see "comparison of old hydronyms" adding "water", "clear", "hard stone", etc.

The German linguist [[Theo Vennemann]] suggested in 2003 that the language of the old European hydronyms was [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] and [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]].<ref>Theo Vennemann, Patrizia Noel Aziz Hanna, ''Europa Vasconica, Europa Semitica'', published by Walter de Gruyter, 2003, {{ISBN|3-11-017054-X}}, 9783110170542.</ref> This theory has been criticised as being seriously flawed, and the more generally accepted view is that hydronyms are of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kitson|first=P.R.|title=British and European River Names|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|date=November 1996|volume=94|issue=2|pages=73–118|doi=10.1111/j.1467-968X.1996.tb01178.x}}</ref>

The Spanish philologist Francisco Villar Liébana argued in 1990 for the Old European preserved in river names and confined to the hydronymic substratum in the Iberian Peninsula as yet another Indo-European layer with no immediate relationship to the [[Lusitanian language]].<ref name=wodtkovillar>{{cite book|last=Wodtko|first=Dagmar S|title=Celtic from the West Chapter 11: The Problem of Lusitanian|year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books, Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-410-4|pages=338}}</ref> However, the idea of "Old European" was criticized by Untermann in 1999 and De Hoz in 2001.<ref name=wodtkovillar/> 
Villar Liébana is a supporter of Gimbutas against the theories of [[Colin Renfrew]]. In his work, ''Indoeuropeos y No Indoeuropeos en la Hispania Prerromana'' (''"Indo-Europeans and Non-Indo-Europeans in Pre-Roman Hispania"'') he presents a nine root "series" and a few more collective "series", mainly of toponyms (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) but also including hydronyms.<ref name=lieb>{{cite book|author=Francisco Villar Liébana|title=Indoeuropeos y No Indoeuropeos en la Hispania Perromana|year =2000|ISBN= 84-7800-968-X}}</ref>
 
For example, in chapter IV B VII<ref name=lieb/>{{rp|120}} Liebana discusses hydronyms of the series "uba" starting <ref name=lieb/>{{rp|149}} with Maenuba (Pliny 3.8) = modern [[Veléz]] and with the same name affluent of the [[Baetis]] (Pliny 3.11) = [[Guadiamar]], [[Salduba]] (close to [[Málaga]]). He compares modern rivers like Ubia, Ove, Fonte dos Ovos  with, amongst others, the [[Danube]],<ref name=lieb/>{{rp|149}} and with historical Corduba (actual [[Córdoba, Andalusia]]).<ref name=lieb/>{{rp|153}} Wherever "uba" appears, like in the rivers Saruba = actual [[Saar (river)]], an affluent of [[Moselle (river)|Mosel]], Spanish fuente Sarobals (Huesca), Sarrubian (Huesca), he acknowledges only "uba" and not the root "Dan" in Danubius (corresponding to [[Dnieper]] and [[Dniester]]) or the root "Sar" in others, which all are Indo-European roots.
