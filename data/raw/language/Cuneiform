From p. 526:  "{{lang|la|Istiusmodi enim ductuli pyramidales seu Cuneiformes non veniunt in Gavrorum literis, nec in Telesmaticis, nec in Hieroglyphicis Ægypti; sed tales ductus (tam inter seinvicem juxta positi quam per seinvicem transmissi) sunt peculiares Persepoli ...}}" (Because such thin pyramidal or wedge forms do not occur in the letters of the Gavres [variously spelled Gabres, Guebers, Ghebers, or Chebers, was an old English name for [[Zoroastranism|Zoroastrians]], an ancient cult of fire worshippers; the word Gavres was derived from the Persian word [[Giaour|''gaur'']] for "infidel"], nor in talismans, nor in Egyptian hieroglyphs; but such drawings (so closely placed among each other as [intended to] be conveyed by means of each other) are peculiar to Persepolis, ... )

According to (Meade, 1974), p. 5, the German naturalist, physician, and explorer [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] (1651–1716) is often credited with having coined the word "cuneiform"; see:
*  Kaempfer, Engelbert, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31378008345145;view=1up;seq=11 ''Amoenitatum Exoticarum'' … ] [Of Foreign Charms … ] (Lippe (Lemgoviae), (Germany): Heinrich Wilhelm Meyer, 1712), [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31378008345145;view=1up;seq=413 p. 331.] On p. 331 Kaempfer describes cuneiform as:  ''" … formam habentibus cuneolorum; … "'' ( … having the form of wedges; … ).  [Note:  A sample of the cuneiform from Persepolis appears on [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31378008345145;view=1up;seq=415 the plate following p. 332.] ]
However, on pp. 317–318, Kaempfer states that he had read Thomas Hyde's book ''Historia Religionis Veterum Persarum'':
*  [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31378008345145;view=1up;seq=397 From pp. 317–318:]  ''"Cl. ''Thomas Hyde'', Anglus, Vir in linguis & rebus exoticis præclare doctus, in ''Hist.

Emerging in [[Sumer]] in the late fourth millennium BC (the [[Uruk period|Uruk IV period]]) to convey the [[Sumerian language]], which was a [[language isolate]], cuneiform writing began as a system of [[pictogram]]s, stemming from an earlier system of shaped tokens used for accounting. In the third millennium, the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use grew smaller ([[Hittite cuneiform]]). The system consists of a combination of [[logophonetic]], consonantal alphabetic and syllabic signs.

The original [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] script was adapted for the writing of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ([[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian]]/[[Babylonia]]n), [[Eblaite language|Eblaite]] and [[Amorite language|Amorite]] languages, the [[language isolate]]s [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hattic language|Hattic]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Urartian language|Urartian]], as well as [[Indo-European languages]] [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]]; it inspired the later Semitic [[Ugaritic alphabet]] as well as [[Old Persian cuneiform]]. Cuneiform writing was gradually replaced by the [[Phoenician alphabet]] during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–612 BC). By the second century AD, the script had become extinct, its last traces being found in [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]], and all knowledge of how to read it was lost until it began to be deciphered in the 19th century.

Between half a million<ref name=BAR/> and two million cuneiform tablets are estimated to have been excavated in modern times, of which only approximately 30,000<ref name=DigHamm/>–100,000 have been read or published. The [[British Museum]] holds the largest collection ({{circa}} 130,000), followed by the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin]], the [[Louvre]], the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]], the [[National Museum of Iraq]], the [[Yale Babylonian Collection]] ({{circa}} 40,000) and [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|Penn Museum]].

These texts include genres as variegated as mythology and mathematics, law codes and beer recipes. In most cases these documents are the earliest exemplars of their genres, and cuneiformists have made unique and valuable contributions to the study of such moderns disciplines as history, law, religion, linguistics, mathematics, and science. In spite of continued great interest in mankind's earliest documents it has been estimated that only about 1/10 of the extant cuneiform texts have been read even once in modern times. There are various reasons for this: the complex Sumero/Akkadian script system is inherently difficult to learn; there is, as yet, no standard computer encoding for cuneiform; there are only a few hundred qualified cuneiformists in the world; the pedagogical tools are, in many cases, non-optimal; and access to the widely distributed tablets is expensive, time-consuming, and, due to the vagaries of politics, becoming increasingly difficult.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714163229/http://pages.jh.edu/~dighamm/version2/research/2003_03_Museums%20and%20the%20Web%20Conference%202003.pdf|archivedate=July 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Early writing tablet recording the allocation of beer.jpg|thumb|Early writing tablet recording the allocation of beer in southern [[Iraq]], 3100–3000 BC]]

The cuneiform writing system was in use for more than three millennia, through several stages of development, from the 31st century BC down to the second century AD.<ref>Adkins 2003, p. 47.</ref> Ultimately, it was completely replaced by [[alphabetic writing]] (in the general sense) in the course of the [[Roman era]], and there are no cuneiform systems in current use. It had to be deciphered as a completely unknown writing system in 19th-century [[Assyriology]]. Successful completion of its deciphering is dated to 1857.

===Proto-literate period===
{{see also|Kish tablet}}
[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sumerian inscription in monumental archaic style, c. 26th century BC]]
The cuneiform script was developed from pictographic [[proto-writing]] in the late 4th millennium BC, stemming from the near eastern token system used for accounting. These tokens were in use from the 9th millennium BC and remained in occasional use even late in the 2nd millennium BC.<ref>Denise Schmandt-Besserat, "An Archaic Recording System and the Origin of Writing." Syro Mesopotamian Studies, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 1–32, 1977</ref> It has been suggested that the token shapes were the original basis for some of the Sumerian pictographs.<ref>Denise Schmandt-Besserat, An Archaic Recording System in the Uruk-Jemdet Nasr Period,  American Journal of Archaeology, vol. 83, no. 1, pp. 19–48, (Jan., 1979)</ref>

Mesopotamia's "proto-literate" period spans roughly the 35th to 32nd centuries. The first documents unequivocally written in Sumerian date to the 31st century BC at [[Jemdet Nasr]].

Originally, pictographs were either drawn on [[clay]] tablets in vertical columns with a sharpened [[Phragmites|reed]] [[stylus]] or incised in stone. This early style lacked the characteristic wedge shape of the strokes.

Certain signs to indicate names of gods, countries, cities, vessels, birds, trees, etc., are known as [[determinative]]s and were the Sumerian signs of the terms in question, added as a guide for the reader. Proper names continued to be usually written in purely "logographic" fashion.

The earliest known Sumerian king whose name appears on contemporary cuneiform tablets is [[Enmebaragesi]] of Kish. Surviving records only very gradually become less fragmentary and more complete for the following reigns, but by the end of the pre-Sargonic period, it had become standard practice for each major city-state to date documents by year-names commemorating the exploits of its ''lugal'' (king).

From about 2900 BC, many pictographs began to lose their original function, and a given sign could have various meanings depending on context. The sign inventory was reduced from some 1,500 signs to some 600 signs, and writing became increasingly [[phonological]]. Determinative signs were re-introduced to avoid ambiguity. Cuneiform [[writing]] proper thus arises from the more primitive system of pictographs at about that time ([[Early Bronze Age II]]).

===Archaic cuneiform===
{{Further|Liste der archaischen Keilschriftzeichen|Early Dynastic Cuneiform}}
[[File:Letter Luenna Louvre AO4238.jpg|thumb|Letter sent by the high-priest Luenna to the king of [[Lagash]] (maybe [[Urukagina]]), informing him of his son's death in combat, [[Girsu]] c. 2400 BC]]

In the mid-3rd millennium BC, the direction of writing was changed to left-to-right in horizontal rows (rotating all of the pictographs 90° counter-clockwise in the process) and a new wedge-tipped stylus was introduced which was pushed into the clay, producing wedge-shaped ("cuneiform") signs; these two developments made writing quicker and easier. By adjusting the relative position of the tablet to the stylus, the writer could use a single tool to make a variety of impressions.

[[File:Cuneiform inscriptions, Stela of Iddi-Sin, king of Simurrum..JPG|thumb|Cuneiform inscriptions, Stela of Iddi-Sin, king of Simurrum]]

Cuneiform tablets could be fired in [[kiln]]s to bake them hard, and so provide a permanent record, or they could be left moist and recycled, if permanence was not needed. Many of the clay tablets found by archaeologists have been preserved by chance, baked when attacking armies burned the buildings in which they were kept.

[[File:An Inscribed stand's head, early dynastic period..JPG|thumb|An inscribed stand's head, early dynastic period]]

The script was also widely used on commemorative [[stele|stelae]] and carved reliefs to record the achievements of the ruler in whose honour the monument had been erected.

The spoken language included many [[homophone]]s and near-homophones, and in the beginning similar-sounding words such as "life" [til] and "arrow" [ti] were written with the same symbol. After the Semites conquered Southern Mesopotamia, some signs gradually changed from being pictograms to syllabograms, most likely to make things clearer in writing. In that way the sign for the word "arrow" would become the sign for the sound "ti".
Words that sounded alike would have different signs; for instance the syllable "gu" had fourteen different symbols.
When the words had similar meaning but very different sounds they were written with the same symbol. For instance "tooth" [zu], "mouth" [ka] and "voice" [gu] were all written with the symbol for "voice". To be more accurate, scribes started adding to signs or combining two signs to define the meaning. They used either geometrical patterns or another cuneiform sign. 
As time went by, the cuneiform got very complex and the distinction between a pictogram and syllabogram became vague. Several symbols had too many meanings to permit clarity. Therefore, symbols were put together to indicate both the sound and the meaning of a compound. The word "Raven" [UGA] had the same logogram as the word "soap" [NAGA], name of a city [EREŠ] and the patron goddess of Eresh [NISABA]. Two phonetic complements were used to define the word [u] in front of the symbol and [gu] behind. Finally the symbol for "bird" [MUŠEN] was added to ensure proper interpretation.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}

Written Sumerian was used as a scribal language until the first century AD. The spoken language died out around the 18th century BC.

===Akkadian cuneiform===

The archaic cuneiform script was adopted by the [[Akkadian Empire]] from the 23rd century BC ([[short chronology]]), and by the beginning of the [[Short chronology timeline#Middle Bronze Age|Middle Bronze Age]] (20th century BC), it had evolved into [[Old Assyrian Empire|Old Assyrian]] cuneiform, with many modifications to Sumerian orthography. The [[Semitic languages]] employed equivalents for many signs that were distorted or abbreviated to represent new values because the syllabic nature of the script as refined by the Sumerians was not intuitive to Semitic speakers. At this stage, the former pictograms were reduced to a high level of abstraction, and were composed of only five basic wedge shapes: horizontal, vertical, two diagonals and the ''Winkelhaken'' impressed vertically by the tip of the stylus. The signs exemplary of these basic wedges are
* AŠ (B001, U+12038) <span lang="akk">{{Cuneiform|[[:wikt:𒀸|𒀸]]}}</span>: horizontal;
* DIŠ (B748, U+12079) <span lang="akk">{{Cuneiform|[[:wikt:𒁹|𒁹]]}}</span>: vertical;
* GE<sub>23</sub>, DIŠ ''tenû'' (B575, U+12039) <span lang="akk">{{Cuneiform|[[:wikt:𒀹|𒀹]]}}</span>: downward diagonal;
* GE<sub>22</sub> (B647, U+1203A) <span lang="akk">{{Cuneiform|[[:wikt:𒀺|𒀺]]}}</span>: upward diagonal;
* U (B661, U+1230B) <span lang="akk">{{Cuneiform|[[:wikt:𒌋|𒌋]]}}</span>: the ''[[Winkelhaken]]''.
Except for the ''Winkelhaken'' which has no tail, the length of the wedges' tails could vary as required for sign composition.

Signs tilted by about 45 degrees are called ''tenû'' in Akkadian, thus DIŠ is a vertical wedge and DIŠ ''tenû'' a diagonal one. If a sign is modified with additional wedges, this is called ''gunû'' or "gunification"; if signs are crosshatched with additional ''Winkelhaken'', they are called ''šešig''; if signs are modified by the removal of a wedge or wedges, they are called ''nutillu''.

"Typical" signs have about five to ten wedges, while complex [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]] can consist of twenty or more (although it is not always clear if a ligature should be considered a single sign or two collated, but distinct signs); the ligature KAxGUR<sub>7</sub> consists of 31 strokes.

Most later adaptations of Sumerian cuneiform preserved at least some aspects of the Sumerian script. Written [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] included phonetic symbols from the Sumerian [[syllabary]], together with [[logogram]]s that were read as whole words. Many signs in the script were polyvalent, having both a syllabic and logographic meaning. The complexity of the system bears a resemblance to [[Old Japanese]], written in a Chinese-derived script, where some of these Sinograms were used as logograms and others as phonetic characters.

===Assyrian cuneiform===
This "mixed" method of writing continued through the end of the [[Babylonia]]n and [[Assyria]]n empires, although there were periods when "purism" was in fashion and there was a more marked tendency to spell out the words laboriously, in preference to using signs with a phonetic complement. Yet even in those days, the Babylonian syllabary remained a mixture of logographic and phonemic writing.

[[Hittite cuneiform]] is an adaptation of the Old Assyrian cuneiform of c. 1800 BC to the [[Hittite language]]. When the cuneiform script was adapted to writing Hittite, a layer of Akkadian logographic spellings was added to the script, thus the pronunciations of many Hittite words which were conventionally written by logograms are now unknown.

In the Iron Age (c. 10th to 6th centuries BC), Assyrian cuneiform was further simplified. From the 6th century, the [[Akkadian language]] was marginalized by [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], written in the [[Aramaean alphabet]], but Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use in literary tradition well into times of [[Parthian Empire]] (250 BC – AD 226). The last known cuneiform inscription, an astronomical text, was written in 75 AD.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Marckham |last=Geller |title=The Last Wedge |journal=Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und vorderasiatische Archäologie |volume=87 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=43–95 |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/zava.1997.87.issue-1/zava.1997.87.1.43/zava.1997.87.1.43.xml |doi=10.1515/zava.1997.87.1.43 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721045552/http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/zava.1997.87.issue-1/zava.1997.87.1.43/zava.1997.87.1.43.xml |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Derived scripts===
The complexity of the system prompted the development of a number of simplified versions of the script. [[Old Persian]] was written in a subset of simplified cuneiform characters known today as [[Old Persian cuneiform]]. It formed a semi-alphabetic syllabary, using far fewer wedge strokes than Assyrian used, together with a handful of logograms for frequently occurring words like "god" and "king". [[Ugaritic]] was written using the [[Ugaritic alphabet]], a standard Semitic style [[alphabet]] (an ''[[abjad]]'') written using the cuneiform method.

==Decipherment==
For centuries, travellers to [[Persepolis]], in modern-day [[Iran]], had noticed carved cuneiform inscriptions and were intrigued.<ref name="Sayce">Sayce 1908.</ref> Attempts at deciphering these [[Old Persian cuneiform|Old Persian writings]] date back to [[Sociology in medieval Islam#Archeology|Arabo-Persian historians]] of the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], though these early attempts at [[decipherment]] were largely unsuccessful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Egyptology: The Missing Millennium : Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings|first=Okasha|last=El Daly|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=1-84472-063-2|pages=39–40 & 65|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

In the 15th century, the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Giosafat Barbaro]] explored ancient ruins in the Middle East and came back with news of a very odd writing he had found carved on the stones in the temples of [[Shiraz]] and on many clay tablets.

In 1836, the eminent French scholar [[Eugène Burnouf]] discovered that the first of the inscriptions published by Niebuhr contained a list of the [[Satrap#Medo-Persian satraps|satrapies]] of Darius. With this clue in his hand, he identified and published an alphabet of thirty letters, most of which he had correctly deciphered.<ref name="Sayce"/>{{rp|14}}<ref>Burnouf 1836</ref><ref name="Prichard">Prichard 1844, pp.&nbsp;30–31</ref>

Meanwhile, in 1835 [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]], a British East India Company army officer, visited the [[Behistun Inscription]]s in [[Iran|Persia]]. Carved in the reign of [[Darius I of Persia|King Darius of Persia]] (522–486 BC), they consisted of identical texts in the three official languages of the empire: Old [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] and [[Elamite]]. The Behistun inscription was to the decipherment of cuneiform what the [[Rosetta Stone]] was to the decipherment of [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s.<ref>Adkins 2003.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>

Rawlinson correctly deduced that the Old Persian was a phonetic script and he successfully deciphered it. In 1837 he finished his copy of the Behistun inscription, and sent a translation of its opening paragraphs to the Royal Asiatic Society. Before his article could be published, however, the works of Lassen and Burnouf reached him, necessitating a revision of his article and the postponement of its publication. Then came other causes of delay. In 1847 the first part of the Rawlinson's Memoir was published; the second part did not appear until 1849.<ref>Rawlinson 1847.</ref>{{efn|It seems that various parts of Rawlisons' paper formed Vol X of this journal.

After translating the Persian, Rawlinson and, working independently of him, the Irish [[Assyriologist]] [[Edward Hincks]], began to [[decipher]] the others. (The actual techniques used to decipher the [[Akkadian language]] have never been fully published; Hincks described how he sought the proper names already legible in the deciphered Persian while Rawlinson never said anything at all, leading some to speculate that he was secretly copying Hincks.<ref>Daniels 1996.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlj/2011/cdlj2011_001.html |first=Kevin J. |last=Cathcart |title=The Earliest Contributions to the Decipherment of Sumerian and Akkadian |journal=Cuneiform Digital Library Journal |year=2011 |issue=1 |issn=1540-8779}}</ref>) They were greatly helped by the excavations of the French naturalist [[Paul Émile Botta]] and English traveler and diplomat [[Austen Henry Layard]] of the city of [[Nineveh]] from 1842. Among the treasures uncovered by Layard and his successor [[Hormuzd Rassam]] were, in 1849 and 1851, the remains of two libraries, now mixed up, usually called the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]], a royal archive containing tens of thousands of baked clay tablets covered with cuneiform inscriptions.

By 1851, Hincks and Rawlinson could read 200 Babylonian signs. They were soon joined by two other decipherers: young German-born scholar [[Julius Oppert]], and versatile British Orientalist [[William Henry Fox Talbot]]. In 1857 the four men met in London and took part in a famous experiment to test the accuracy of their decipherments. [[Edwin Norris]], the secretary of the [[Royal Asiatic Society]], gave each of them a copy of a recently discovered inscription from the reign of the Assyrian emperor [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. A jury of experts was empanelled to examine the resulting translations and assess their accuracy. In all essential points the translations produced by the four scholars were found to be in close agreement with one another. There were of course some slight discrepancies. The inexperienced Talbot had made a number of mistakes, and Oppert's translation contained a few doubtful passages which the jury politely ascribed to his unfamiliarity with the English language. But Hincks' and Rawlinson's versions corresponded remarkably closely in many respects. The jury declared itself satisfied, and the decipherment of Akkadian cuneiform was adjudged a ''fait accompli''.<ref>Rawlinson, Henry; Fox Talbot, William Henry; Hincks, Edward; and Oppert, Julius, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GGI-AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Inscription of Tiglath-Pileser I., King of Assyria, B.C. 1150,'' …] (London, England:  J. W. Parker and Son, 1857).  For a description of the "experiment" in the translation of cuneiform, see pp. 3–7.</ref>

===Proper names===
In the early days of cuneiform decipherment, the reading of proper names presented the greatest difficulties. However, there is now a better understanding of the principles behind the formation and the pronunciation of the thousands of names found in historical records, business documents, votive inscriptions, literary productions and legal documents. The primary challenge was posed by the characteristic use of old Sumerian non-phonetic logograms in other languages that had different pronunciations for the same symbols. Until the exact phonetic reading of many names was determined through parallel passages or explanatory lists, scholars remained in doubt, or had recourse to conjectural or provisional readings. However, in many cases, there are variant readings, the same name being written phonetically (in whole or in part) in one instance and logographically in another.

==Transliteration==
[[File:Cyrus cylinder extract.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Extract from the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] (lines 15–21), giving the genealogy of [[Cyrus the Great]] and an account of his capture of [[Babylon]] in 539 BC]]
Cuneiform has a specific format for [[transliteration]]. Because of the script's [[wikt:polyvalent|polyvalence]], transliteration requires certain choices of the transliterating scholar, who must decide in the case of each sign which of its several possible meanings is intended in the original document. For example, the sign [[dingir|DINGIR]] in a Hittite text may represent either the Hittite syllable ''an'' or may be part of an Akkadian phrase, representing the syllable ''[[ilah|il]]'', it may be a [[Sumerogram]], representing the original Sumerian meaning, 'god' or the [[determinative]] for a deity. In transliteration, a different rendition of the same glyph is chosen depending on its role in the present context.

Therefore, a text containing DINGIR and MU in succession could be construed to represent the words "ana", "ila", god + "a" (the [[accusative case]] ending), god + water, or a divine name "A" or Water. Someone transcribing the signs would make the decision how the signs should be read and assemble the signs as "ana", "ila", "Ila" ("god"+accusative case), etc. A transliteration of these signs, however, would separate the signs with dashes "il-a", "an-a", "DINGIR-a" or "<sup>D</sup>a". This is still easier to read than the original cuneiform, but now the reader is able to trace the sounds back to the original signs and determine if the correct decision was made on how to read them. A transliterated document thus presents the reading preferred by the transliterating scholar as well as an opportunity to reconstruct the original text.

There are differing conventions for transliterating Sumerian, Akkadian (Babylonian) and Hittite (and Luwian) cuneiform texts. One convention that sees wide use across the different fields is the use of acute and grave accents as an abbreviation for homophone disambiguation. Thus, ''u'' is equivalent to ''u<sub>1</sub>'', the first glyph expressing phonetic ''u''. An acute accent, ''ú'', is equivalent to the second, ''u<sub>2</sub>'', and a grave accent ''ù'' to the third, ''u<sub>3</sub>'' glyph in the series (while the sequence of numbering is conventional but essentially arbitrary and subject to the history of decipherment). In Sumerian transliteration, a multiplication sign 'x' is used to indicate [[typographic ligature]]s. As shown above, signs ''as such'' are represented in [[capital letter]]s, while the specific reading selected in the transliteration is represented in small letters. Thus, capital letters can be used to indicate a so-called Diri compound – a sign sequence that has, in combination, a reading different from the sum of the individual constituent signs (for example, the compound IGI.A – "water" + "eye" – has the reading ''imhur'', meaning "foam"). In a Diri compound, the individual signs are separated with dots in transliteration. Capital letters may also be used to indicate a Sumerogram (for example, KÙ.BABBAR – Sumerian for "silver" – being used with the intended [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] reading ''kaspum'', "silver"), an Akkadogram, or simply a sign sequence of whose reading the editor is uncertain. Naturally, the "real" reading, if it is clear, will be presented in small letters in the transliteration: IGI.A will be rendered as imhur<sub>4</sub>.

Since the Sumerian language has only been widely known and studied by scholars for approximately a century, changes in the accepted reading of Sumerian names have occurred from time to time. Thus the name of a king of [[Ur]], read ''Ur-Bau'' at one time, was later read as ''Ur-Engur'', and is now read as [[Ur-Nammu]] or Ur-Namma; for [[Lugal-zage-si]], a king of [[Uruk]], some scholars continued to read ''Ungal-zaggisi''; and so forth. Also, with some names of the older period, there was often uncertainty whether their bearers were Sumerians or Semites. If the former, then their names could be assumed to be read as Sumerian, while, if they were Semites, the signs for writing their names were probably to be read according to their Semitic equivalents, though occasionally Semites might be encountered bearing genuine Sumerian names. There was also doubt whether the signs composing a Semite's name represented a phonetic reading or a logographic compound. Thus, e.g. when inscriptions of a Semitic ruler of Kish, whose name was written ''Uru-mu-ush'', were first deciphered, that name was first taken to be logographic because ''uru mu-ush'' could be read as "he founded a city" in Sumerian, and scholars accordingly retranslated it back to the original Semitic as ''Alu-usharshid''. It was later recognized that the URU sign can also be read as ''rí'' and that the name is that of the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] king [[Rimush]].

==Syllabary==
The tables below show signs used for simple syllables of the form CV or VC. As used for the Sumerian language, the cuneiform script was in principle capable of distinguishing at least 16 consonants,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlp/cdlp0002_20160104.pdf |first=Daniel A. |last=Foxvog |title=Introduction to Sumerian grammar |pages=16–17, 20–21 |postscript=none |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103191548/http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlp/cdlp0002_20160104.pdf |archivedate=January 3, 2017 |df=mdy-all }} (about phonemes g̃ and ř and their representation using cuneiform signs).</ref><ref>{{cite thesis |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/16107/Binnenwerk-jagersma.pdf?sequence=2 |title=A descriptive grammar of Sumerian |pages=43–45, 50–51 |first=A.

as well as four vowel qualities, ''a, e, i, u''.
The Akkadian language had no use for ''g̃'' or ''ř'' but needed to distinguish its [[emphatic series]], ''q, ṣ, ṭ'', adopting various "superfluous" Sumerian signs for the purpose (e.g. ''qe''=KIN, ''qu''=KUM, ''qi''=KIN, ''ṣa''=ZA, ''ṣe''=ZÍ, ''ṭur''=DUR etc.{{Clarify|date=August 2009}})
Hittite, as it adopted the Akkadian cuneiform, further introduced signs such as ''wi<sub>5</sub>''=GEŠTIN.

[[File:Cuneiform writing Ur.jpg|thumb|right|Cuneiform writing in [[Ur]], southern Iraq]]

The Sumerian cuneiform script had on the order of 1,000 distinct signs (or about 1,500 if variants are included). This number was reduced to about 600 by the 24th century BC and the beginning of Akkadian records. Not all Sumerian signs are used in Akkadian texts, and not all Akkadian signs are used in Hittite.

Falkenstein (1936) lists 939 signs used in the earliest period ([[Uruk period|late Uruk]], 34th to 31st centuries).
With an emphasis on ''Sumerian'' forms, [[Anton Deimel|Deimel]] (1922) lists 870 signs used in the [[Fara period|Early Dynastic II]] period (28th century, "LAK") and for the Early Dynastic IIIa period (26th century, "ŠL").
Rosengarten (1967) lists 468 signs used in Sumerian (pre-[[Sargon of Akkad|Sargonian]]).
[[Lagash]] and Mittermayer ("aBZL", 2006) list 480 Sumerian forms, written in Isin-Larsa and Old Babylonian times. Regarding ''Akkadian'' forms, the standard handbook for many years was Borger ("ABZ", 1981) with 598 signs used in Assyrian/Babylonian writing, recently superseded by Borger ("MesZL", 2004) with an expansion to 907 signs, an extension of their Sumerian readings and a new numbering scheme.

Signs used in [[Hittite cuneiform]] are listed by Forrer (1922), Friedrich (1960) and the ''HZL'' (Rüster and Neu 1989). The HZL lists a total of 375 signs, many with variants (for example, 12 variants are given for number 123 ''EGIR'').

===Numerals===
{{Main|Babylonian numerals}}
The Sumerians used a numerical system based on 1, 10 and 60. The way of writing a number like 70 would be the sign for 60 and the sign for 10 right after. This way of counting is still used today for measuring time as 60 seconds per minute and 60 minutes per hour.

== Usage ==
Cuneiform script was used in many ways in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. It was used to record laws, like the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. It was also used for recording maps, compiling medical manuals, and documenting religious stories and beliefs, among other uses.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 2016|title=The World's Oldest Writing|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=2f0d7c0d-4a6b-4ce8-97dd-388db96deeeb%40sessionmgr105&vid=0&hid=118&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=114537239&db=a9h|journal=Archaeology|volume=69|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 18, 2016|via=Virtual Library of Virginia}}</ref> Studies by Assyriologists like Claus Wilcke<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wer las und schrieb in Babylonien und Assyrien|last=Wilcke|first=Claus|publisher=Verlag der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften|year=2000|isbn=978-3-7696-1612-5|location=München|pages=|via=}}</ref> and [[Dominique Charpin]]<ref>Charpin, Dominique. 2004. "Lire et écrire en Mésopotamie: une affaire dé spécialistes?" Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres: 481–501.</ref> suggest that cuneiform literacy was not reserved solely for the elite but was common for average citizens.

According to the Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Veldhuis|first=Niek|date=2011|title=Levels of Literacy|url=|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199557301.001.0001|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}</ref> cuneiform script was used at a variety of literacy levels:

Average citizens needed only a basic, functional knowledge of cuneiform script to write personal letters and business documents. More highly literate citizens put the script to more technical use, listing medicines and diagnoses and writing mathematical equations. Scholars held the highest literacy level of cuneiform and mostly focused on writing as a complex skill and an art form.

==Unicode==
{{Main|Cuneiform (Unicode block)|Cuneiform Numbers and Punctuation|l2=Cuneiform Numbers and Punctuation (Unicode block)|3=Early Dynastic Cuneiform|l3=Early Dynastic Cuneiform (Unicode block)}}

As of version 8.0, the following ranges are assigned to the Sumero-Akkadian Cuneiform script in the [[Unicode|Unicode Standard]]:
:U+12000–U+123FF (922 assigned characters) "[[Cuneiform (Unicode block)|Cuneiform]]"
:U+12400–U+1247F (116 assigned characters) "[[Cuneiform Numbers and Punctuation]]"
:U+12480–U+1254F (196 assigned characters) "[[Early Dynastic Cuneiform]]"

The final proposal for Unicode encoding of the script was submitted by two cuneiform scholars working with an experienced Unicode proposal writer in June 2004.<ref>Everson, Michael; Feuerherm, Karljürgen; Tinney, Steve (June 8, 2004). "[https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04189-n2786-cuneiform.pdf Final proposal to encode the Cuneiform script in the SMP of the UCS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017100311/http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04189-n2786-cuneiform.pdf |date=October 17, 2016 }}."</ref>
The base character inventory is derived from the list of [[Ur III]] signs compiled by the [[Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative]] of [[UCLA]] based on the inventories of Miguel Civil, Rykle Borger (2003) and Robert Englund. Rather than opting for a direct ordering by glyph shape and complexity, according to the numbering of an existing catalogue, the Unicode order of glyphs was based on the Latin alphabetic order of their "last" Sumerian transliteration as a practical approximation.
