{{Internet}}
'''Internet slang''' ('''Internet shorthand''', '''cyber-slang''', '''netspeak''', or '''chatspeak''') refers to various kinds of [[slang]] used by different people on the [[Internet]]. An example of Internet slang is "[[:wikt:LOL#English|LOL]]" meaning "laugh out loud". It is difficult to provide a standardized definition of Internet slang due to the constant changes made to its nature.<ref name=Yin>Yin Yan (2006) World Wide Web and the Formation of the Chinese and English "Internet Slang Union". Computer-Assisted Foreign Language Education. Vol. 1. {{ISSN|1001-5795}}</ref> However, it can be understood to be any type of [[slang]] that [[Internet]] users have popularized, and in many cases, have coined. Such terms often originate with the purpose of saving [[keystroke]]s or to compensate for small character limits. Many people use the same [[abbreviation]]s in [[text messaging|texting]] and [[instant messaging]], and [[social networking websites]]. [[Acronym]]s, [[Computer keyboard|keyboard symbols]] and [[abbreviation]]s are common types of Internet slang. New dialects of slang, such as [[leet]] or [[Lolcat|Lolspeak]], develop as [[ingroup]] [[internet meme]]s rather than time savers. Some people only use LOL for fun. Many people use this [[internet slang]] not only on the Internet but also face-to-face.

==Creation and evolution==

===Origins===
Internet slang originated in the early days of the Internet with some terms predating the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|last=Daw |first=David |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/248526/web_jargon_origins_revealed.html |title=Web Jargon Origins Revealed |publisher=Pcworld.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref> Internet slang is used in [[chat room]]s, [[social networking service]]s, [[online game]]s, [[video game]]s and in the [[online community]]. Since 1979, users of communications networks like [[Usenet]] created their own [[shorthand]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Meggyn |url=http://theunderenlightened.com/trolling-for-slang-the-origins-of-internet-werdz/ |title=Trolling For Slang: The Origins of Internet Werdz |publisher=Theunderenlightened.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref>

==In pop culture==
In Japanese, the term [[moe (slang)|moe]] has come into common use among slang users to mean something extremely cute and appealing.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Aside from the more frequent abbreviations, acronyms, and [[emoticon]]s, Internet slang also uses archaic words or the lesser-known meanings of mainstream terms.<ref name= Yin /> Regular words can also be altered into something with a similar pronunciation but altogether different meaning, or attributed new meanings altogether.<ref name= Yin /> Phonetic transcriptions of foreign words, such as the transformation of "impossible" into "impossibru" in Japanese and then [the [[transliteration]] of that] back to [the character set used for] English, also occur.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In places where [[logograph]]ic languages are used, such as China, a visual Internet slang exists, giving characters dual meanings, one direct and one implied.<ref name= Yin />

===Motivations===
The primary motivation for using a slang unique to the Internet is to ease [[communication]]. However, while Internet slang shortcuts save time for the writer, they take two times as long for the reader to understand, according to a study by the [[University of Tasmania]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Don't be 404, know the tech slang|date=December 10, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7775013.stm|work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> On the other hand, similar to the use of slang in traditional face-to-face speech or written language, slang on the Internet is often a way of indicating [[social group|group membership]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Crystal, David |date=1997|title= The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language|edition= Second |location=Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}</ref>

Internet slang provides a channel which facilitates and constrains our ability to communicate in ways that are fundamentally different from those found in other semiotic situations. Many of the expectations and practices which we associate with spoken and written language are no longer applicable. The Internet itself is ideal for new slang to emerge because of the richness of the medium and the availability of information.<ref name=bas /> Slang is also thus motivated for the "creation and sustenance of online communities".<ref name=bas /> These communities, in turn, play a role in solidarity or identification<ref name=Yin /><ref name= miao /> or an exclusive or common cause.<ref name=mud />

David Crystal distinguishes among five areas of the Internet where slang is used- [[World Wide Web|The Web itself]], [[email]], [[asynchronous communication|asynchronous chat]] (for example, [[mailing list]]s), [[synchronous communication|synchronous chat]] (for example, [[Internet Relay Chat]]), and [[virtual world]]s.<ref name=Davidcrystal>{{cite book|author=Crystal, David |date=2001|title= Language and the Internet|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-80212-1}}</ref> The [[computer|electronic]] character of the channel has a fundamental influence on the language of the medium. Options for communication are constrained by the nature of the hardware needed in order to gain Internet access. Thus, productive linguistic capacity (the type of information that can be sent) is determined by the preassigned characters on a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], and receptive linguistic capacity (the type of information that can be seen) is determined by the size and configuration of the screen. Additionally, both sender and receiver are constrained linguistically by the properties of the internet [[software]], [[computer hardware]], and [[networking hardware]] linking them. Electronic discourse refers to writing that is "very often reads as if it were being spoken – that is, as if the sender were writing talking".<ref>{{cite book|authors=Davis, B.H. & Brewer, J. P. |date=1997 |title=Electronic discourse: linguistic individuals in virtual space|location= Albany, NY|publisher= State University of New York Press}}</ref>

==Types of slang==

Internet slang does not constitute a homogeneous language variety. Rather, it differs according to the user and type of Internet situation.<ref name=hohenhaus>Hohenhaus, Peter (2005). Elements of traditional and "reverse" purism in relation to computer-mediated communication. In Langer, Nils and Winifred V. Davies (eds.), Linguistic Purism in the Germanic Languages. Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 203-220.</ref> However, within the language of Internet slang, there is still an element of [[linguistic prescriptivism|prescriptivism]], as seen in [[style guides]], for example ''Wired Style'',<ref name=hale>[Hale, C. and Scanlon, J (1999). Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age. New York: Broadway Books]</ref> which are specifically aimed at usage on the Internet. Even so, few users consciously heed these prescriptive recommendations on CMC, but rather adapt their styles based on what they encounter online.<ref>Baron, Naomi. (2000). ''Alphabet to Email.'' London: Routledge.</ref> Although it is difficult to produce a clear definition of Internet slang, the following types of slang may be observed. This list is not exhaustive.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class !! Description
|-
| Letter homophones || Included within this group are [[abbreviation]]s and [[acronym]]s. An abbreviation is a shortening of a word, for example "CU" or "CYA" for "see you (see ya)". An acronym, on the other hand, is a subset of abbreviations and are formed from the initial components of a word. Examples of common acronyms include "LOL" for "laugh out loud", "BTW" for "by the way" and "TFW" for "that feeling when". There are also combinations of both, like "CUL8R" for "see you later".
|-
| Punctuation, capitalizations, and other symbols || Such features are commonly used for emphasis. Periods or exclamation marks may be used repeatedly for emphasis, such as "........" or "!!!!!!!!!!". Question marks and exclamation marks are often used together in strings such as "?!?!?!?!" when one is angry while asking a question. Grammatical punctuation rules are also relaxed on the Internet. "E-mail" may simply be expressed as "email", and apostrophes can be dropped so that "John's book" becomes "johns book". Examples of capitalizations include "STOP IT", which can convey a stronger emotion of annoyance as opposed to "stop it". Bold, underline and italics are also used to indicate stress.
|-
| Onomatopoeic or stylized spellings || [[Onomatopoeia|Onomatopoeic]] spellings have also become popularized on the Internet. One well-known example is "hahaha" to indicate laughter. Onomatopoeic spellings are very language specific. For instance, in Spanish, laughter is spelled as "jajaja" instead because J is pronounced like H in Spanish. In Thai it's 55555 because 5 in Thai is said Ha. In Korean, it is "kekeke".
|-
| Keyboard-generated emoticons and smileys || [[Emoticon]]s are generally found in web forums, instant messengers, and online games. They are culture-specific and certain emoticons are only found in some languages but not in others. For example, the Japanese equivalent of emoticons, kaomoji (literally "face marks"), focus on the eyes instead of the mouth as in Western emoticons. They are also meant to be read right-side up, as in ^_^ as opposed to sideways, :3. More recently than face emoticons, other emoticon symbols such as <3 (which is a sideways heart) have emerged. Compared to emoticons used in Western cultures such as the [[United States]], kaomoji play a very distinct social role in online discourse.<ref>Katsuno, Hirofumi and Christine R. Yano (2002), ''[[Asian Studies Review]]'' 26(2): 205-231</ref>
|-
| Direct requests || These are found in chat engines such as [[Internet Relay Chat]] or online games, where personal identities may be concealed. As such, questions such as "A/S/L?" which stands for "age, sex, location?" are commonly posed.<ref name=Thurlow>Thurlow, C. (2001), Language and the Internet, In R, Mesthrie & R, Asher (Eds), The concise encyclopedia of sociolinguistics, London: Pergamon</ref>
|-
| Leet || [[Leet]]speak, or 1337,<ref>{{cite web|title=1337 - what is it and how to be 1337|url=http://www.1337.net/|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref> is an alternative alphabet for the English language which uses various combinations of ASCII characters to replace Latinate letters. For example, Wikipedia may be expressed as "\/\/1|<1p3[)14". It originated from computer hacking, but its use has been extended to online gaming as well. Leet is far less common now than in the first decades of the internet.
|-
| Novel [[syntax|syntactic]] features || Unusual syntactic structures such as "[[I Can Has Cheezburger?]]" and "You are doing me a frighten" have been encouraged and spread by highly successful memes. Pluralization of "the internets" is another example, which has become common since it was used by [[George W. Bush]] during a televised event.
|-
| [[Flaming (Internet)|Flaming]] || Flaming refers to the use of rude or profane language in interactions between Internet users.<ref>Baron, N.S. (2003). Language of the Internet. In A. Farghali (Ed.), The Stanford handbook for language engineers (pp. 59—127). Stanford, California: CSLI</ref> It can be caused by any subject of polarizing nature. For example, there is an ongoing debate among users of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[classic Mac OS]]/[[macOS]] as to which is "superior". Historically, the act of flaming has been described as an intrinsic quality of [[email]]s due to an absence of visual and auditory cues in [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC).<ref>Lea, Martin, Tim O'Shea, Pat Fung, and Russel Spears (1992), 'Flaming' in Computer-Mediated Communication. Contexts of Computer-Mediated Communication, ed. Martin Lea, 89-112. New York: Harvester Wheatsheaf.</ref>
|-
| [[Padonkaffsky jargon]] || Olbanian language is a [[Russian language|Russian]] [[Cant (language)|cant]] language developed by [[padonki]] of [[Runet]]. The language entered mainstream culture and it has been suggested that Olbanian should be taught in schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usrbc.org/resources/russiannews/event/1192 |title=Reuters |publisher=Usrbc.org |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref> Similar systems exist for other languages with non-Roman scripts such as Hebrew and Arabic.

==Views on Internet slang==

There have been ongoing debates about how the use of slang on the Internet influences language usage outside of technology. Even though the direct causal relationship between the Internet and language has yet to be proven by any scientific research,<ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/internets-effect-on-language-debated |title=Internet's Effect on Language Debated |publisher=Newjerseynewsroom.com |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422130830/http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/internets-effect-on-language-debated |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}</ref> Internet slang has invited split views on its influence on the standard of language use in non-computer-mediated communications.

[[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptivists]] tend to have the widespread belief that the Internet has a negative influence on the future of language, and that it would lead to a degradation of standard.<ref name=Davidcrystal /> Some would even attribute any decline of standard formal English to the increase in usage of electronic communication.<ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com  /> It has also been suggested that the linguistic differences between Standard English and CMC can have implications for literacy education.<ref>Hawisher, Gale E. and Cynthia L. Selfe (eds). (2002). Global Literacies and the World-Wide Web. London/New York: Routledge</ref> This is illustrated by the widely reported example of a school essay submitted by a Scottish teenager, which contained many abbreviations and acronyms likened to [[SMS language]]. There was great condemnation of this style by the mass media as well as educationists, who expressed that this showed diminishing literacy or linguistic abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2814235.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; UK &#124; Is txt mightier than the word? |publisher=Newsvote.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref>

On the other hand, [[Linguistic description|descriptivists]] have counter-argued that the Internet allows better expressions of a language.<ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com  /> Rather than established linguistic conventions, linguistic choices sometimes reflect personal taste.<ref name=baron>Baron, Naomi S. (2002). Who sets email style: Prescriptivism, coping strategies, and democratizing communication access. The Information Society 18, 403-413</ref> It has also been suggested that as opposed to intentionally flouting language conventions, Internet slang is a result of a lack of motivation to monitor speech online.<ref>Baron, Naomi (2003) "Why Email Looks Like Speech: Proofreading Pedagogy and Public Face." In New Media Language, ed. Jean Aitchison and Diana M. Lewis, 85–94. London: Routledge.</ref> Hale and Scanlon describe language in Emails as being derived from "writing the way people talk", and that there is no need to insist on 'Standard' English.<ref name=hale /> English users, in particular, have an extensive tradition of etiquette guides, instead of traditional prescriptive treatises, that offer pointers on linguistic appropriateness.<ref name=baron /> Using and spreading Internet slang also adds onto the cultural currency of a language.<ref name=Garcia /> It is important to the speakers of the language due to the foundation it provides for identifying within a group, and also for defining a person's individual linguistic and communicative competence.<ref name=Garcia /> The result is a specialized subculture based on its use of slang.<ref name="annemarie">Simon-Vandenbergen, Anne Marie (2008) Deciphering L33t5p34k: Internet Slang on Message Boards. Thesis paper. Ghent University Faculty of Arts and Philosophy</ref>

In scholarly research, attention has, for example, been drawn to the effect of the use of Internet slang in [[ethnography]], and more importantly to how conversational relationships online change structurally because slang is used.<ref name=Garcia>Garcia, Angela Cora, Standlee, Alecea I., Beckhoff, Jennifer and Yan Cui. Ethnographic Approaches to the Internet and Computer-Mediated Communication. Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. Vol. 38 No. 1 pp 52–84</ref>

In German, there is already considerable controversy regarding the use of [[anglicisms]] outside of CMC.<ref>Hohenhaus, Peter. (2002). Standardization, language change, resistance and the question of linguistic threat: 18th-century English and present-day German. In: Linn, Andrew R. and Nicola McLelland (eds.). Standardization - Studies from the Germanic languages. Amsterdam: Benjamins (= Current Issues in Linguistic Theory volume 235), 153-178</ref> This situation is even more problematic within CMC, since the [[jargon]] of the medium is dominated by English terms.<ref name=hohenhaus /> An extreme example of an anti-anglicisms perspective can be observed from the chatroom rules of a Christian site,<ref>[https://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/cilt/main] {{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> which bans all anglicisms ("{{lang|de|Das Verwenden von Anglizismen ist strengstens untersagt!}}" [Using anglicisms is strictly prohibited!]), and also translates even fundamental terms into German equivalents.<ref name=hohenhaus />

==Use beyond computer-mediated communication==
Internet [[slang]] has crossed from being mediated by the computer into other non-physical domains.<ref name=autogenerated1>Crystal, David (September 20, 2001). Language and the Internet. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-80212-1}}.</ref> Here, these domains are taken to refer to any domain of interaction where interlocutors need not be geographically proximate to one another, and where the Internet is not primarily used. Internet slang is now prevalent in telephony, mainly through short messages ([[SMS]]) communication. [[Abbreviation]]s and [[interjection]]s, especially, have been popularized in this medium, perhaps due to the limited character space for writing messages on mobile phones. Another possible reason for this spread is the convenience of transferring the existing mappings between expression and meaning into a similar space of interaction.<ref name=new.bbc.co.uk>"Don't be 404, know the tech slang". BBC. December 10, 2008.</ref>

At the same time, Internet slang has also taken a place as part of everyday [[offline]] language, among those with digital access.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The nature and content of [[online]] conversation is brought forward to direct [[offline]] [[communication]] through the [[telephone]] and direct talking, as well as through [[Orthography|written language]], such as in writing notes or letters. In the case of interjections, such as numerically based and abbreviated Internet slang, are not pronounced as they are written physically or replaced by any actual action. Rather, they become [[Lexicalisation|lexicalized]] and spoken like non-slang words in a "stage direction" like fashion, where the actual action is not carried out but substituted with a verbal signal. The notions of flaming and [[troll (Internet)|trolling]] have also extended outside the computer, and are used in the same circumstances of deliberate or unintentional implicatures.<ref name=bas />

The expansion of Internet slang has been furthered through codification and the promotion of digital literacy. The subsequently existing and growing popularity of such references among those online as well as offline has thus advanced Internet slang [[Digital literacy|literacy]] and globalized it.<ref>Wellman, Barry (2004) The glocal village: Internet and community. Arts and Science Review. University of Toronto. Issue 1, Series 1.</ref> Awareness and proficiency in manipulating Internet slang in both online and offline communication indicates digital literacy and teaching materials have even been developed to further this knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |last=Singhal |first= M. |title=The Internet and foreign language education: Benefits and challenges |publisher=The Internet TESL Journal |year=1997 |url=http://iteslj.org/}}</ref> A South Korean publisher, for example, has published a textbook that details the meaning and context of use for common Internet slang instances and is targeted at young children who will soon be using the Internet.<ref>Ashcroft, Brian (2010) Hey Korean Kids, Let's Learn Leetspeak And Internet Slang. Published February 11th, 2010. Retrieved from [http://kotaku.com/5469239/hey-korean-kids-lets-learn-leetspeak-and-internet-slang]</ref> Similarly, Internet slang has been recommended as language teaching material in second language classrooms in order to raise communicative competence by imparting some of the cultural value attached to a language that is available only in slang.<ref>Quintana, M. (2004) Integration of Effective Internet Resources for Future Teachers of Bilingual Ed. National Association of African American Studies, 2004</ref>

Meanwhile, well-known dictionaries such as the [[Oxford Dictionary of English|OED]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/category/word-trends-and-new-words/ |title=Oxford Dictionary official blog |publisher=Blog.oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref> and [[Merriam-Webster]] have been updated with a significant and growing body of slang jargon. Besides common examples, lesser known slang and slang with a non-English etymology have also found a place in standardized linguistic references. Along with these instances, literature in user-contributed dictionaries such as [[Urban Dictionary]] has also been added to. Codification seems to be qualified through frequency of use, and novel creations are often not accepted by other users of slang.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Brian |url=http://www.noslang.com/rejects/ |title=Rejects |publisher=Noslang.com |accessdate= 28 November 2017}}</ref>

===Internet slang today===
Although Internet slang began as a means of "opposition" to mainstream language, its popularity with today's globalized digitally literate population has shifted it into a part of everyday language, where it also leaves a profound impact.<ref>{{Unbulleted list | {{cite web |last= Eller |first= Lara L. |year= 2005 |work= Thesis |title= Instant Message Communication and its Impact upon Written Language |publisher= [[West Virginia University]] |url=  http://www.wvu.edu/ }}
{{cite web |title= Alternate source  |website= WVU Scholar |url= http://wvuscholar.wvu.edu/ |subscription= yes }}

Frequently used slang also have become conventionalised into memetic "unit[s] of cultural information".<ref name=bas>{{cite web |last=Flamand |first=E |year=2008 |title=The impossible task of dialog analysis in chatboxes |url=http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:D28k7Tswv5wJ:scholar.google.com/+internet+slang+meme&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5}}</ref> These memes in turn are further spread through their use on the Internet, prominently through websites. The Internet as an "information superhighway" is also catalysed through slang.<ref name="annemarie"/> The evolution of slang has also created a 'slang union'<ref name=Yin /> as part of a unique, specialised subculture.<ref name=annemarie /> Such impacts are, however, limited and requires further discussion especially from the non-English world. This is because Internet slang is prevalent in languages more actively used on the [[Internet]], like [[English language|English]], which is the [[Internet]]'s [[lingua franca]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20332763|title=Learn English online: How the internet is changing language}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/lingua-franca.html|title=English - the universal language on the Internet?|quote=English essentially is the universal language of the Internet}}</ref>

==Around the world==
[[File:Grass Mud Horse Seal.svg|thumb|Chinese seal carving work. The character is a combination of three characters, which is done by Chinese [[netizen]]. This is a satire of [[Chinese Internet censorship]]. See [[Grass Mud Horse]].]]

The Internet has helped people from all over the world to become connected to one another, enabling "global" relationships to be formed.<ref>Barry Wellman (2004). "The Glocal Village: Internet and Community." ''Ideas&s'' Vol 1:1</ref> As such, it is important for the various types of slang used online to be recognizable for everyone. It is also important to do so because of how other languages are quickly catching up with English on the Internet, following the increase in Internet usage in predominantly non-English speaking countries. In fact, as of May 31, 2011, only approximately 27% of the online population is made up of English speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm |title=Internet World Stats |publisher=Internet World Stats |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref>

Different cultures tend to have different motivations behind their choice of slang, on top of the difference in language used. For example, in [[Chinese Internet Slang|China]], because of the tough Internet regulations imposed, users tend to use certain slang to talk about issues deemed as sensitive to the government. These include using symbols to separate the characters of a word to avoid detection from manual or automated text pattern scanning and consequential [[censorship]].<ref>Zhou Shuguang (2008). "Notes On The Net." ''Index on Censorship'' Vol 37:2</ref> An outstanding example is the use of the term [[river crab (Internet slang)|river crab]] to denote censorship. River crab (hexie) is pronounced the same as "harmony"—the official term used to justify political discipline and censorship. As such Chinese netizens reappropriate the official terms in a sarcastic way.<ref>Nordin, Astrid and Richaud, Lisa (2014), "Subverting official language and discourse in China? Type river rrab for harmony," ''China Information'' 28, 1 (March): 47–67.</ref>

[[Abbreviations]] are popular across different cultures, including countries like [[Japan]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], etc., and are used according to the particular language the Internet users speak. Significantly, this same style of slang creation is also found in non-alphabetical languages<ref name=Yin /> as, for example, a form of "e gao" or alternative political discourse.<ref name=mud>Meng Bingchun (2011) "From Steamed Bun to Grass Mud Horse: E Gao as alternative political discourse on the Chinese Internet." ''Global Media and Communication'' April 2011 vol. 7 no. 1 33–51</ref>

The difference in language often results in miscommunication, as seen in an [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] example, "555", which sounds like "crying" in Chinese, and "laughing" in Thai.<ref name=lovelovechina.com>{{cite web |author=Crystal Tao |date=6 May 2010 |url=http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ |title=Why Thai Laugh When Chinese Cry? |publisher=Lovelovechina.com |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420091421/http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df= }}</ref> A similar example is between the English "haha" and the Spanish "jaja", where both are onomatopoeic expressions of laughter, but the difference in language also meant a different consonant for the same sound to be produced.

In terms of culture, in Chinese, the numerically based onomatopoeia "770880" ({{Zh|c = |s = 亲亲你抱抱你|t = 親親你抱抱你|p = qīn qīn nǐ bào bào nǐ}}), which means to 'kiss and hug you', is used.<ref name=lovelovechina.com /> This is comparable to "XOXO", which many Internet users use. In French, "pkoi" is used in the place of pourquoi, which means 'why'. This is an example of a combination of onomatopoeia and shortening of the original word for convenience when writing online.

In conclusion, every different country has their own language background and cultural differences and hence, they tend to have their own rules and motivations for their own Internet slang. However, at present, there is still a lack of studies done by researchers on some differences between the countries.

On the whole, the popular use of Internet slang has resulted in a unique online and offline community as well as a couple sub-categories of "special internet slang which is different from other slang spread on the whole internet... similar to jargon... usually decided by the sharing community".<ref name=miao>Wei Miao Miao (2010) "Internet slang used by online Japanese anime fans." ''3PM Journal of Digital Researching and Publishing''. Session 2 2010 pp 91–98</ref> It has also led to virtual communities marked by the specific slang they use<ref name=miao /> and led to a more homogenized yet diverse online culture.<ref name=Yin /><ref name=miao />
