'''Erotomania''' is listed in the [[DSM-5]] as a subtype of a delusional disorder.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Oliveira |first1=C. |last2=Alves |first2=S. |last3=Ferreira |first3=C. |last4=Agostinho |first4=C. |last5=Avelino |first5=M.J.|date=2016|title=Erotomania-A review of De Clerambault's Syndrome.|url=|journal=The Journal of the European Psychiatric Association|volume=33|pages=664|via=}}</ref> It is a relatively uncommon paranoid condition that is characterized by an individual's delusions of another person being infatuated with them.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Segal, J.H.|first=|date=1989|title=Erotomania revisited: From Kraepelin to DSM-III-R|url=|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=146|pages=1261|via=}}</ref> This disorder is most often seen (though not exclusively) in female patients that are shy, dependent and sexually inexperienced.

[[Delusions of reference]] are common, as the erotomanic individual often perceives that they are being sent messages from the secret admirer through innocuous events such as seeing license plates from specific states.<ref name=":1" /> Commonly, the onset of erotomania is sudden, and the course is chronic.<ref name=":1" />

==Presentation==

Erotomania is more common in women, but men are more likely to exhibit violent and stalker-like behaviors.<ref name=":1" /> The core symptom of the disorder is that the sufferer holds an unshakable belief that another person is secretly in love with them. In some cases, the sufferer may believe several people at once are "secret admirers". Most commonly, the individual has delusions of being loved by an unattainable man who is usually an acquaintance or someone the person has never met. The sufferer may also experience other types of delusions concurrently with erotomania, such as delusions of reference, wherein the perceived admirer secretly communicates their love by subtle methods such as body posture, arrangement of household objects, colors, license plates on cars from specific states, and other seemingly innocuous acts (or, if the person is a public figure, through clues in the media). Some delusions may be extreme such as the conception, birth, and kidnapping of children that never existed. The delusional objects may be replaced by others over time, and some may be chronic in fixed forms.<ref name=":1" /> Denial is characteristic with this disorder as the patients do not accept the fact that their object of delusion may be married, unavailable, or uninterested. The phantom lover may also be imaginary or deceased. Erotomania has two forms: primary and secondary. Primary erotomania is also commonly referred to as de Clerambault's syndrome and Old Maid's Insanity<ref name=":2" /> and it exists alone without comorbidities, has a sudden onset and a chronic outcome.<ref name=":1" /> The secondary form is found along with mental disorders like paranoid schizophrenia, often includes persecutory delusions, hallucinations, and grandiose ideas, and has a more gradual onset.<ref name=":1" /> Patients with a "fixed" condition are more seriously ill with constant delusions and are less responsive to treatment. These individuals are usually timid, dependent women that are often sexually inexperienced.<ref name=":1" /> In those with a more mild, recurrent condition, delusions are shorter-lived and the disorder can exist undetected by others for years.<ref name=":2" /> Problematic behaviors include actions like calling, sending letters and gifts, making unannounced house visits and other persistent stalking behaviors.<ref name=":1" />

==Etiology==

Erotomania may present as a primary mental disorder, or as a symptom of another psychiatric illness. With secondary erotomania, the erotomanic delusions are due to other mental disorders such as bipolar I disorder or schizophrenia. Symptoms may also be precipitated by alcoholism and the use of antidepressants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seeman, M.V.|first=|date=2016|title=Erotomania and recommendations for treatment|url=|journal=Psychiatric Quarterly|volume=87|pages=355–364|via=}}</ref> There may be a potential genetic component involved as family histories of first degree relatives with histories of psychiatric disorders are common. [[Sigmund Freud]] explained erotomania as a defense mechanism to ward off homosexual impulses which can lead to strong feelings of paranoia, denial, displacement and projection. Similarly, it has been explained as a way to cope with severe loneliness or ego deficit following a major loss.<ref name=":1" /> Erotomania may also be linked to unsatiated urges dealing with homosexuality or narcissism.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Kelly, B.D.|first=|date=2005|title=Erotomania: Epidemiology and management|url=|journal=CNS Drugs|volume=19|pages=657–669|via=}}</ref> Some research shows brain abnormalities occurring in patients with erotomania such as heightened temporal lobe asymmetry and greater volumes of lateral ventricles than those with no mental disorders.<ref name=":2" />

==Prognosis and treatment==

Prognosis differs from person to person, and the ideal treatment is not completely understood. Treatment for this disorder gains the best results when tailored specifically for each individual. To date, the mainline pharmacological treatments have been pimozide (a typical antipsychotic which was also approved for treating Tourette's Syndrome),<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> and atypical anti-psychotics like risperidone and clozapine.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Non-pharmacologic treatments that have shown some degree of efficacy are electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), supportive psychotherapy, family and environment therapy,<ref name=":1" /> rehousing, risk management and treating underlying disorders in cases of secondary erotomania.<ref name=":2" /> ECT may provide temporary remission of delusional beliefs; anti-psychotics help attenuate delusions and reduce agitation or associated dangerous behaviors, and SSRIs may be used to treat secondary depression.<ref name=":1" /> In delusional disorder there is some evidence that pimozide has superior efficacy compared with other antipsychotics. Psychosocial psychiatric interventions can enhance the quality of life through allowing some social functioning, and treating comorbid disorders is a priority for secondary erotomania.<ref name=":2" /> Family therapy, adjustment of socio-environmental factors, and replacing delusions with something positive may be beneficial to all. In most cases, harsh confrontation should be avoided.<ref name=":1" /> Structured risk assessment helps to manage risky behaviors in those individuals more likely to engage in actions that include violence, stalking, and crime.<ref name=":2" /> For particularly troublesome cases, neuroleptics and enforced separation may be moderately effective.<ref name=":0" />

==History==

[[File:Female patient suffering from erotomania, 1843 Wellcome L0022720.jpg|thumb|268x268px|M.S.P. "Female patient suffering from erotomania," from [[Alexander Morison]]'s ''The Physiognomy of Mental Diseases'']]Early references to the condition can be found in the work of Hippocrates, Freud (1911), G.G. de Clérambault (1942),<ref name=":1" /> Erasistratus, Plutarch and Galen. Parisian physician, Bartholomy Pardoux (1545-1611) covered the topics of nymphomania and erotomania.<ref name=":1" /> In 1623, erotomania was referred to in a treatise by Jacques Ferrand<ref name=":1" /> (Maladie d'amour ou Mélancolie érotique) and has been called "erotic paranoia" and "erotic self-referent delusion" until the common usage of the terms erotomania and de Clérambault's syndrome. In 1971 and 1977, M.V. Seeman referred to the disorder as "phantom lover syndrome" and "psychotic erotic transference reaction and delusional loving".<ref name=":1" /> Emil Kraepelin and Bernard also wrote of erotomania and more recently, Winokur, Kendler, and Munro have contributed to knowledge on the disorder.<ref name=":2" />

G. E. Berrios and N. Kennedy outlined in 'Erotomania: a conceptual history' (2002)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berrios GE, Kennedy N|first=|date=2002|title=Erotomania: a conceptual history|url=|journal=History of Psychiatry|volume=13 (52, pt4)|pages=381–400|via=}}</ref> several periods of history through which the definition of erotomania has changed considerably:

*Classical times – early eighteenth century: General disease caused by unrequited love
*Early eighteenth-beginning of nineteenth century: Practice of excess physical love (akin to nymphomania or satyriasis)
*Early nineteenth century – beginning twentieth century: Unrequited love as a form of mental disease
*Early twentieth century – present: Delusional belief of "being loved by someone else"

In one case, erotomania was reported in a patient who had undergone surgery for a ruptured cerebral aneurysm.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Anderson |first1=CA |last2=Camp |first2=J |last3=Filley |first3=C.M.|date=1998|title=Erotomania after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: case report and literature review|url=|journal=J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci|volume=10 (3)|pages=330–337|via=}}</ref>

==Well-known cases==

In his paper that described the syndrome, de Clérambault referenced a patient he had counselled who was obsessed with British monarch George V.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://crimefeed.com/2013/10/9-stalkers-that-make-us-glad-were-not-famous/|title=9 Stalkers That Make Us Glad We're Not Famous.|last1=McDonnell |last2=Margaux |last3=McPadden.|first=|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> She had stood outside Buckingham Palace for hours at a time, believing that the king was communicating his desire for her by moving the curtains.<ref name=":3" />

Parallels were drawn between this and a 2011 case where the body of a homeless American man was found on a secluded [[traffic island]] within sight of Buckingham Palace. The man had sent hundreds of "strange and offensive" packages to Queen Elizabeth II over the previous 15 years.<ref name=":3" />

The assassination attempt on [[Ronald Reagan]] by [[John Hinckley, Jr.]] has been reported to have been driven by an erotomanic fixation on [[Jodie Foster]], whom Hinckley was attempting to impress.

Late night TV entertainer [[David Letterman]] and former astronaut [[Story Musgrave]] were both stalked by [[Margaret Mary Ray]], who suffered from erotomania.<ref name=":3" />

Michael David Barrett allegedly suffered from erotomania, stalking ESPN correspondent [[Erin Andrews]] across the country, trying to see her and taking lewd videos.<ref name=":3" />

It is important to note that many cases of obsession or stalking can be linked to erotomania but do not always necessarily go hand in hand.

==Portrayals in fiction==
