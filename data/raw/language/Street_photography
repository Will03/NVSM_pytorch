'''Street photography''', also sometimes called [[candid photography]], is [[photography]] conducted for art or enquiry that features unmediated chance encounters and random incidents<ref>{{cite book|last1=Warner Marien|first1=Mary|title=100 ideas that changed photography|date=2012|publisher=[[Laurence King Publishing]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-85669-793-4|page=169}}</ref> within [[Public space|public places]].  Although there is a difference between street and candid photography, it is usually subtle with most street photography being candid in nature and some [[candid photography]] being classifiable as street photography. Street photography does not necessitate the presence of a street or even the urban environment.  Though people usually feature directly, street photography might be absent of people and can be of an object or environment where the image projects a decidedly human character in facsimile or aesthetic.<ref name="West">[[Colin Westerbeck]].

{{Quote box|quote=The photographer is an armed version of the solitary walker reconnoitering, stalking, cruising the urban inferno, the voyeuristic stroller who discovers the city as a landscape of voluptuous extremes.

Framing and timing can be key aspects of the craft with the aim of some street photography being to create images at a decisive or poignant moment.

Street photography can focus on people and their behavior in public, thereby also recording [[people's history]]. This motivation entails having also to navigate or negotiate changing expectations and laws of privacy, security and property. In this respect the street photographer is similar to [[social documentary photography|social documentary photographers]] or [[Photojournalism|photojournalists]] who also work in public places, but with the aim of capturing newsworthy events; any of these photographers' images may capture people and property visible within or from public places. The existence of services like [[Google Street View]], recording public space at a massive scale, and the burgeoning trend of self-photography ([[selfies]]), further complicate ethical issues reflected in attitudes to street photography.

Much of what is regarded, stylistically and subjectively, as definitive street photography was made in the era spanning the end of the 19th century<ref name="watts-independent">{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/london-street-photography-museum-of-london-2238534.html | date = 11 March 2011 | accessdate = 28 April 2015 | first = Peter | last = Watts | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | title = London Street Photography, Museum of London}}</ref> through to the late 1970s, a period which saw the emergence of portable cameras that enabled [[candid photography]] in public places.

==History==
[[Genre art|Depictions of everyday public life form a genre]] in almost every period of world art, beginning in the pre-historic, Sumerian, Egyptian and early Buddhist art periods. Art dealing with the life of the street, whether within views of cityscapes, or as the dominant [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]], appears in the West in the canon of the [[Northern Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], of [[Romanticism]], [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]], [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]]. With the type having been so long established in other media, it followed that photographers would also pursue the subject as soon as technology enabled them.

===Nineteenth-century precursors===
[[File:Boulevard du Temple by Daguerre (unmirrored).jpg|thumb|[[Louis Daguerre]]: ''"Boulevard du Temple"'' (1838 or 1839)]]
In 1838 or 1839 the first photograph of figures in the street was recorded by [[Louis Daguerre|Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre]] in one of a pair of [[daguerreotype]] views taken from his studio window of the [[Boulevard du Temple]] in Paris. The second, made at the height of the day shows an unpopulated stretch of street, while the other was taken at approximately 8:00 am, and as Beaumont Newhall reports, "The Boulevard, so constantly filled with a moving throng of pedestrians and carriages was perfectly solitary, except an individual who was having his boots brushed. His feet were compelled, of course, to be stationary for some time, one being on the box of the boot black, and the other on the ground. Consequently his boots and legs were well defined, but he is without body or head, because these were in motion."<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Newhall |first1=Beaumont |author-link=Beaumont Newhall |year=1982 |orig-year=First published 1949 |title=The history of photography from 1839 to the present day |edition=5th |publisher=Museum of Modern Art |page=16 |isbn=978-0-87070-381-2}}</ref>

[[File:Nègre, Charles - Wasserspender (Zeno Fotografie).jpg|thumb|left|Charles Nègre, Waterseller.]]
[[Charles Nègre]] was the first photographer to achieve the technical sophistication required to register people in movement on the street in Paris in 1851.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mora |first1=Gilles |title=PhotoSPEAK |date=1998 |publisher=Abbeville Press |location=New York |page=186 |isbn=0-7892-0068-6}}</ref> Photographer [[John Thomson (photographer)|John Thomson]], a Scotsman working with journalist and social activist Adolphe Smith, published ''Street Life in London'' in twelve monthly installments starting in February 1877.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Thomson |first1=John |author-link1=John Thomson (photographer) |last2=Smith |first2=Adolphe | year=1969 |orig-year=First published in 1877 |title=Street life in London |location=New York |publisher=Benjamin Blom |page=Publisher's Note |oclc=558085267}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Abbott |first1=Brett |year=2010 |title=Engaged observers : documentary photography since the sixties |publisher=J.

[[Eugene Atget]] is regarded as a progenitor, not because he was the first of his kind, but as a result of the popularisation in the late 1920s of his record of Parisian streets by [[Berenice Abbott]], who was inspired to undertake a similar documentation of New York City.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} As the city developed, Atget helped to promote Parisian streets as a worthy subject for photography. From the 1890s to the 1920s he photographed mainly its architecture, stairs, gardens, and windows. He did photograph some [[Laborer|workers]] but people were not his main focus.

===Twentieth-century practitioners===

[[Mass-Observation]] was a social research organisation founded in 1937 which aimed to record everyday life in Britain and to record the reactions of the 'man-in-the-street' to [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]]'s abdication in 1936 to marry divorcée [[Wallis Simpson]], and the succession of [[George VI]]. [[Humphrey Spender]] made photographs on the streets of the northern English industrial town of [[Bolton]], identified for the project's publications as "Yorktown", while filmmaker [[Humphrey Jennings]] made a cinematic record in London for a parallel branch of investigation. The chief Mass-Observationists were [[anthropologist]] [[Tom Harrisson]] in Bolton and poet [[Charles Madge]] in London, and their first report was produced as the book "May the Twelfth: Mass-Observation Day-Surveys 1937 ''by over two hundred observers"''<ref>{{Cite book | author1=Jennings, Humphrey | title=May the twelfth : Mass-Observation day-surveys, 1937 | publication-date=1937 | publisher=Faber and Faber | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/25321844 | accessdate=22 March 2016 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2017}}

The post-war French [[Humanist photography|Humanist School]] photographers found their subjects on the street or in the [[bistro]]. They worked primarily in [[Black and white|black‐and‐white]] in available light with the popular small cameras of the day, discovering what the writer [[Pierre Mac Orlan]] (1882–1970) called the "fantastique social de la rue" (social fantastic of the street)<ref>In the unpaginated introduction to Kertész, A., & MacOrlan, P.

Returning to the UK in 1965 from the US where he had met Winogrand and adopted street photography, [[Tony Ray-Jones]] turned a wry eye on often surreal groupings of British people on their holidays or participating in festivals.

== Technique ==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2016}} 
Most kinds of portable camera are used for street photography; for example [[Rangefinder camera|rangefinders]], digital and film [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]]s, and [[point-and-shoot cameras]].

[[File:Cartier-Bresson's first Leica.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a hand-held portable camera, the Leica I]]
The commonly used [[35mm format|35&nbsp;mm]] full-frame format [[Focal length#In photography|focal lengths]] of [[Wide-angle lens|28]]&nbsp;mm to 50&nbsp;mm, are used particularly for their [[angle of view]] and increased [[depth of field]], with wide-angle lenses potentially permitting a candid close approach to the human subjects without their suspecting they are in the frame. However, there are no exclusions as to what might be used.

Two commonly used alternative focusing techniques are [[scale-focus|zone focusing]] and [[hyperfocal distance]], either to free the photographer from manual-focus; or where [[autofocus]] is too slow, or the photographer cannot be sure the focus point will fall where the photographer chooses to place their subject in a quickly changing situation; and which also facilitate shooting "from the hip" i.e. without bringing the camera up to the eye.

With ''zone focusing'', the photographer chooses to set the focus to a specific distance, knowing that a certain area in front of and beyond that point will be in focus. The photographer only has to remember to keep their subject between those set distances.

The ''hyperfocal distance'' technique makes as much as possible ''acceptably'' sharp so that the photographer is freed up even further, from not having to consider the subject's distance, other than not being too close. The photographer sets the focus to a fixed point particular to the lens focal length, and the chosen [[aperture]], and in the case of digital cameras their [[crop factor]]. Thus everything from a specific distance (that will typically be close to the camera), all the way to [[infinity]], will be acceptably sharp. The wider the focal length of the lens (i.e. 28&nbsp;mm), and the smaller the aperture it is set to (i.e. {{f/|11|link=yes}}), and with digital cameras the smaller their crop factor, the closer to the camera is the point at which starts to become acceptably sharp.

Alternatively [[waist-level finder]]s and the [[articulating screen]]s of some digital cameras allow for composing, or adjusting focus, without bringing the camera up to the eye and drawing unwanted attention to the photographer.

Anticipation plays a role where a relevant or ironic background that might act as a foil to a foreground incident or passer-by is carefully framed beforehand; it was a strategy much used for early street photographs, most famously in Cartier-Bresson's figure leaping across a puddle in front of a dance poster in ''Place de l'Europe, Gare Saint Lazare'', 1932.

Tony Ray-Jones listed the following shooting advice to himself in his personal journal:<ref>Ray-Jones' archive, [[National Media Museum]], Bradford, England and exhibited by them in the touring exhibition ''Only in England'' in 2015</ref>
<blockquote>
* Be more aggressive
* Get more involved (talk to people)
* Stay with the subject matter (be patient)
* Take simpler pictures
* See if everything in background relates to subject matter
* Vary compositions and angles more
* Be more aware of composition
* Don’t take boring pictures
* Get in closer (use 50mm lens [or possibly ‘less,’ the writing is unclear])
* Watch camera shake (shoot 250 sec or above)
* Don’t shoot too much
* Not all eye level
* No middle distance
</blockquote>

== Street photography versus documentary photography ==
Street photography and [[documentary photography]] can be very similar genres of photography that often overlap while having distinct individual qualities.

Documentary photographers typically have a defined, premeditated message and an intention to record particular events in history.<ref>Newhall, "Documentary Approach to Photography", Parnassus 10, no. 3 (March 1938): pp. 2–6. 22</ref> The gamut of the documentary approach encompasses aspects of journalism, art, education, sociology and history.<ref>{{Cite book | author1=Becker, Karin E | title=Dorothea Lange and the documentary tradition | publication-date=1980 | publisher=Louisiana State University Press | page=36|isbn=978-0-8071-0551-1 }}</ref> In social investigation, often documentary images are intended to provoke, or to highlight the need for, societal change. Conversely, street photography is réactive and disinterested by nature<ref>Gleason, T. R. (2008). "The communicative roles of street and social landscape photography". ''SIMILE: Stud. Media Infor.

==Legal concerns==
{{Main article|Photography and the law}}

The issue of street photographers taking photographs of strangers in public places ''without their consent'' (i.e. 'candid photography' by definition) for fine art purposes has been controversial. Photographing people and places in public is legal in most countries protecting freedom of expression and journalistic freedom. There are usually limits on how photos of people may be used and most countries have specific laws regarding people's privacy.

Street photography may also conflict with laws that were originally established to protect against [[paparazzi]], [[defamation]] or [[harassment]]; and special laws will sometimes apply when taking pictures of minors.

===Canada===
While the common-law provinces follow the United Kingdom, with respect to the freedom to take pictures in a public place, [[Quebec]] law provides that, in most circumstances, their publication can take place only with the consent of the subjects therein.<ref>{{cite CanLII|litigants=Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc|link=Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc|year=1998|court=scc|num=817|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 55{{en dash}}59|parallelcite=[1998] 1 SCR 591|date=1998-04-09}}</ref>

===European Union===
The European Union's [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which all EU countries have to uphold in their domestic law, establishes in a [[right to privacy]]. This can result in restrictions on the publication of photography.<ref>[[Human Rights Act 1998]] sections 2 & 3</ref> The right to privacy is protected by [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] of the convention. In the context of photography, it stands at odds to the [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 10]] right of freedom of expression. As such, courts will usually consider the public interest in balancing the rights through the legal test of [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===France===
While also limiting photography in order to protect privacy rights, street photography can still be legal in [[France]] when pursued as an art form under certain circumstances. While in one prominent case the freedom of artistic expression trumped the individual's right to privacy, the legality will much depend on the individual case.<ref name="laurent-nytimes">{{cite news | url = http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/paris-city-of-rights/ | date = 23 April 2013 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | first = Olivier | last = Laurent | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | title = Protecting the Right to Photograph, or Not to Be Photographed}}</ref>

===Germany===
Germany protects the right to take photos in public, but also recognizes a "right to one's own picture". That means that even though pictures can often be ''taken'' without someones consent, they must not be published without the permission of the person in the picture. The law also protects specifically against defamation”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-berlin.org/en/watch-out|title=Watch Out!|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>

This right to one's picture, however, does not extend to people who are not the main focus of the picture (e.g. who just wandered into a scene), or who not even recognizable in the photo. It also does not usually extend to people who are public figures (e.g. politicians or celebrities).

If a picture is considered art, the courts will also consider the photographer's freedom of artistic expression; meaning that "artful" street photography can still be legally published in certain cases.

===Greece===
Production, publication and non-commercial sale of street photography is legal in [[Greece]], without the need to have the consent of the shown person or persons. In Greece the right to take photographs and publish them or sell licensing rights over them as fine art or editorial content is protected by the [[Constitution of Greece]] (Article 14<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/Vouli-ton-Ellinon/To-Politevma/Syntagma/article-14/|title=Σύνταγμα|}}</ref> and other articles) and free speech laws as well as by [[Precedent|case law]] and legal cases. Photographing the police and publishing the photographs is also legal.

Photography and video-taking is also permitted across the whole [[Athens Metro]] transport network,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.synigoros.gr/resources/docs/199930.pdf|title=synigoros.gr}}</ref> which is very popular among Greek street photographers.

===Hungary===
In [[Hungary]], from 15 March 2014 anyone taking photographs is technically breaking the law if someone wanders into shot, under a new civil code that outlaws taking pictures without the permission of everyone in the photograph. This expands the law on consent to include the taking of photographs, in addition to their publication.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/14/hungary-law-photography-permission-take-pictures | date = 14 March 2014 | accessdate = 20 May 2014 | first = Daniel | last = Nolan | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | title = Hungary law requires photographers to ask permission to take pictures}}</ref>

===Japan===
In Japan permission, or at least signification of intent to photo and the absence of refusal, is needed both for photography and for publication of photos of ''recognisable'' people even in public places. 'Hidden photography' (''kakushidori'' hidden, surreptitious photography) 'stolen photography' (''nusumitori'' with no intention of getting permission) and "fast photography' (''hayayori'' before permission and refusal can be given) are forbidden unless in the former permission is obtained from the subject immediately after taking the photo. People have rights to their images (''shōzōken'', ''droit de image''). The law is especially strict when that which is taken, or the taking, is in any sense shameful. Exception is made for photos of famous people in public places and news photography by registered news media outlets where favour is given to the public right to know.<ref name="ISSN">{{cite journal |title=肖像権とその周辺 : 写真の撮影・公表をめぐる法律問題と判例の展開 |journal=Journal of law and politics |language=Japanese |trans-title=Study on the Rules for taking a Photograph of a Person and its Publication in Japan |year=2000| last=Murakami |first=Takashi |volume=39 |pages= 25–112 |url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/lognavi?name=nels&lang=en&type=pdf&id=ART0009133241 |format=PDF |issn=0915-0463 |accessdate=2016-12-07 }}</ref>

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]], photographing people in public is legal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Reproducing and selling photographs of people is legal for editorial and limited fair use commercial purposes. There exists no case law to define what the limits on commercial use are. Civil law requires the consent of any identifiable persons for advertorial and promotional purposes. Property, including animals, do not enjoy any special consideration.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, taking pictures of women without their consent, even in public, is considered to be criminal [[sexual assault]], punishable by a fine of under 10 million [[South Korean won|won]] and up to 5 years imprisonment.<ref>[http://www.law.go.kr/%EB%B2%95%EB%A0%B9/%EC%84%B1%ED%8F%AD%EB%A0%A5%EB%B2%94%EC%A3%84%EC%9D%98%20%EC%B2%98%EB%B2%8C%20%EB%93%B1%EC%97%90%20%EA%B4%80%ED%95%9C%20%ED%8A%B9%EB%A1%80%EB%B2%95 "South Korean law on criminal sexual assault, Chapter 1 Article 14"]</ref> In July 2017 an amendment to the law was voted on in favour of allowing for chemical castration of people taking such photographs.<ref>[http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?newsid=01298886615999112&SCD=JG31&DCD=A00703 "Court legalizes chemical castration of men convicted of photography related sexual assault"], edaily</ref>

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom]] has enacted domestic law in accordance with the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]], which limits the publication of certain photographs.<ref name="ReferenceA">Mosley v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2008] EWHC 1777 (QB)</ref><ref>Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd [2004] UKHL 22</ref><ref>Murray v Express Newspapers Plc [2008] EWCA Civ 446</ref>

In terms of photographing property, in general under UK law one cannot prevent photography of [[private property]] from a public place,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} and in general the right to take photographs on private land upon which permission has been obtained is similarly unrestricted.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} However, landowners are permitted to impose any conditions they wish upon entry to a property, such as forbidding or restricting photography.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} There are however nuances to these broad principles.

===USA===
In the USA, the protection of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] is generally interpreted widely, and can include photography.<ref name="firstamendmentphoto">{{cite web|last1=Bill|first1=Kenworthy|title=Photography & the First Amendment|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/photography-the-first-amendment/|website=First Amendment Center}}</ref>

For example, the case ''[[Nussenzweig v. DiCorcia]]'' established that taking, publishing and selling street photography (including street portraits) is legal, even without the consent of the person being portrayed, because photography is protected as free speech and art by the [[First Amendment]].<ref name="nussenzweig-v-dicorcia">{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2006/2006_50171.htm |title=Nussenzweig v. DiCorcia |accessdate=2011-12-05 |quote= |publisher=[[New York Supreme Court]]}}</ref>
