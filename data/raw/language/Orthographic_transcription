'''Orthographic transcription''' is a [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] method that employs the standard [[Orthography|spelling system]] of each target language.<ref>Hayes, Bruce (2011); [https://books.google.com/books?id=QT8W4zDHKvwC&pg=PT30&dq=%22orthographic+transcription%22 Introductory Phonology]; John Wiley & Sons; {{ISBN|1444360132}}, 9781444360134. "The term orthographic transcription simply means that the words are written down using the customary spelling system (orthography) of the language." For a better view of the examples shown in Hayes's book see Fromkin, Victoria (2000); [https://books.google.com/books?id=DObARq3r9MoC&pg=PA525&dq=%22orthographic+transcription%22 Linguistics: an introduction to linguistic theory]''; Wiley-Blackwell; {{ISBN|0631197117}}, 9780631197119</ref><ref name=Vinogradov>[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Transcription thefreedictionary.com/Transcription], citing Vinogradov, V. A., in ''The Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' (1979). Retrieved March 19, 2012.</ref>

Examples of orthographic transcription are "Pushkin" and "Pouchkine", respectively the English and French orthographic transcriptions of the surname "Пу́шкин" in the name Алекса́ндр Пу́шкин ([[Alexander Pushkin]]). Thus, each target language (English and French) transcribes the surname according to its own orthography.<ref name=Vinogradov/>

==Distinction from transliteration==
Transcription as a mapping from sound to script must be distinguished from transliteration, which creates a mapping from one script to another that is designed to match the original script as directly as possible. Standard transcription schemes for linguistic purposes include the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), and its ASCII equivalent, [[SAMPA]]. See also phonetic transcription. Transcription is often confused with transliteration, perhaps due to a common journalistic practice of mixing elements of both in rendering foreign names. The resulting practical transcription is a hybrid that is called both "transcription" and "transliteration" by the general public.

The table below shows examples of phonetic transcription of the name of the former Russian president known in English as Boris Yeltsin, followed by accepted hybrid forms in various languages. English speakers will pronounce "Boris" differently from the original Russian, so it is a transliteration rather than a transcription in the strict sense.

The same words are likely to be transcribed differently under different systems. For example, the [[Mandarin Chinese]] name for the capital of the [[People's Republic of China]] is ''Beijing'' using the commonly used contemporary system [[Hànyǔ Pīnyīn]], but in the historically significant [[Wade–Giles]] system, it is written ''Pei-Ching''.

Practical transcription can be done into a non-alphabetic language too. For example, in a Hong Kong newspaper, [[George W. Bush|George Bush]]'s name is transliterated into two [[Chinese character]]s that sound like "Bou-sū" (布殊) by using the characters that mean  "cloth" and "special". Similarly, many words from English and other Western European languages are borrowed in Japanese and are transcribed using [[Katakana]], one of the Japanese [[syllabary|syllabaries]].

==Subsequent divergence==
After transcribing a word from one language to the script of another language:
* one or both languages may develop further. The original correspondence between the sounds of the two languages may change, and so the pronunciation of the transcribed word develops in a different direction from the original pronunciation.
* the transcribed word may be adopted as a [[loanword]] in another language with the same script. This often leads to a pronunciation and spelling which are different from a direct transcription.

This is especially evident for Greek loanwords and proper names. Greek words were historically first transcribed to Latin (according to their old pronunciations), and then loaned into other languages, and finally the loanword has developed according to the rules of the target language. For example, ''Aristotle'' is the currently used English form of the name of the philosopher whose name in Greek is spelled &nbsp;̓Aριστoτέλης (''Aristotélēs''), which was transcribed to Latin ''Aristoteles'', from where it was loaned into other languages and followed their linguistic development. (In "classical" Greek of Aristotle's time, lower-case letters were not used, and the name was spelled ΑΡΙΣΤΟΤΕΛΗΣ.)

''Pliocene'', a much more recent word, comes from the Greek words πλείων (''pleiôn'', "more") and καινóς (''kainós'', "new"), which were first transcribed (Latinised) to ''plion'' and ''caenus''{{fact|date=May 2016}} and then loaned into other languages.
(<κ> became <c> because there was no <k> in Latin.)

When this process continues over several languages, it may fail miserably to convey the original pronunciation. One ancient example is the [[Sanskrit]] word ''dhyāna'' ("contemplation", "meditation") which was transcribed into the Chinese word ''ch'anna'' through Buddhist scriptures; next shortened into ''ch'an''. ''Ch'an'' (禪), pronounced ''zen'' in Japanese, used as the name of the Buddhist sect of "Chan" ([[Zen Buddhism]]), was transcribed from Japanese (ゼン ''zen'') to ''zen'' in English. ''Dhyāna'' to ''zen'' is quite a change.

Another issue is any subsequent change in "preferred" transcription. For instance, the word describing a philosophy or religion in China was popularized in English as ''[[Tao]]'' and given the termination ''-ism'' to produce an English word ''Taoism''. That transcription reflects the [[Wade–Giles]] system. More recent [[Pinyin]] transliterations produce ''Dao'' and ''Daoism''.
