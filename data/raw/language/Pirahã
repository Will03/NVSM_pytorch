The '''Pirahã''' (pronounced {{IPA-xx|piɾaˈhã|}}) are an [[indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous people]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] in Brazil. The sole surviving subgroup of the [[Mura people]], they are [[hunter-gatherers]]. They live mainly on the banks of the [[Maici River]] in [[Humaitá, Amazonas|Humaitá]] and [[Manicoré]] in the state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]]. {{As of|2018}}, they number 800 individuals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.profil.at/wissenschaft/interview-daniel-everett-9623433|title=Interview: Wie ein Missionar zum Atheisten wurde|date=2018-03-27|work=profil.at|access-date=2018-04-02|language=de}}</ref> The Pirahã people [[exonym|do not]] call themselves ''Pirahã'' but [[endonym|instead]] the '''Hi'aiti'ihi,''' roughly translated as "the straight ones."<ref name="Pullum">{{cite web | url = http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001387.html | title = The Straight Ones: Dan Everett on the Pirahã | last = Pullum | first = Geoffrey K. | publisher = Language Log | date = 26 August 2004 | accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}</ref>

To the linguistic anthropologist [[Daniel Everett]], <blockquote>The Pirahã are supremely gifted in all the ways necessary to ensure their continued survival in the jungle: they know the usefulness and location of all important plants in their area; they understand the behavior of local animals and how to catch and avoid them; and they can walk into the jungle naked, with no tools or weapons, and walk out three days later with baskets of fruit, nuts, and small game.<ref name="Colapinto"/></blockquote>

The Pirahã speak the [[Pirahã language]]. They call any other language "crooked head".<ref name="Colapinto"/> Members of the Pirahã can [[whistled language|whistle their language]], which is how Pirahã men communicate when hunting in the jungle.

== Culture ==
As far as the Pirahã have related to researchers, their culture is concerned solely with matters that fall within direct personal experience, and thus there is no history beyond living memory. Pirahã have a simple [[kinship]] system that includes ''baíxi'' (parent, grandparent, or elder), ''xahaigí'' (sibling, male or female), ''hoagí'' or ''hoísai'' (son), ''kai'' (daughter), and ''piihí'' (stepchild, favorite child, child with at least one deceased parent, and more).<ref name="Everett 2008">{{cite book | title=Don't Sleep, there are Snakes | publisher=Pantheon Books | author=Everett, Daniel L. | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-375-42502-8}}</ref> {{rp|pages=86–87}}

Daniel Everett states that one of the strongest Pirahã values is no coercion; you simply don't tell other people what to do.<ref name="Edge"/> There appears to be no [[social hierarchy]]; the Pirahã have no formal leaders. Their social system can thus be labeled as [[primitive communism]], in common with many other hunter-gatherer bands in the world, although rare in the Amazon because of a history of horticulture before Western contact (see [[History of South America#Amazon|history of the Amazon]]).

Although the Pirahã use canoes every day for fishing and for crossing the river that they live beside, when their canoes wear out, they simply use pieces of bark as temporary canoes. Everett brought in a master builder who taught and supervised the Pirahã in making a canoe, so that they could make their own. But when they needed another canoe, they said that "Pirahã do not make canoes" and told Everett he should buy them a canoe. The Pirahã rely on neighboring communities' canoe work, and use those canoes for themselves.<ref name="Edge"/>

Pirahã build simple huts where they keep a few pots, pans, knives, and machetes. They make only scraping implements (for making arrowheads), loosely woven palm-leaf bags, bows, and arrows.<ref name="Colapinto"/> They take naps of 15 minutes to, at the most, two hours throughout the day and night, and [[Segmented sleep|rarely sleep through the night]].<ref name="Everett 2008" />{{rp|pages=xvii, 13,70,79}}

They do not store food in any quantity, but generally eat it when they get it.<ref name="Colapinto"/> Pirahã have ignored lessons in preserving meats by salting or smoking.<ref name="Colapinto"/> They cultivate manioc plants that grow from spit-out seeds and make only a few days' worth of manioc flour at a time.<ref name="Colapinto"/> They trade [[Brazil nut]]s and sex for consumables or tools, e.g. machetes, gunpowder, powdered milk, sugar, whiskey. Chastity is not a cultural value.<ref name="Edge"/> They trade Brazil nuts, wood, and ''[[sorva]]'' (rubbery sap used in chewing gum) for soda-can pull-tabs, which are used for necklaces.<ref name="Colapinto"/>  Men wear T-shirts and shorts that they get from traders; women sew their own plain cotton dresses.<ref name="Colapinto"/>

Their decoration is mostly necklaces, used primarily to [[Apotropaism|ward off spirits]].<ref name="Everett 2008" />{{rp|pages=74}} The concept of drawing is alien to them and when asked to draw a person, animal, tree, or river, the result is simple lines.<ref name="PG-SOM">Gordon, Peter.

According to Everett, the Pirahã have no concept of a supreme spirit or god,<ref>Everett, Daniel. [http://fora.tv/2009/03/20/Daniel_Everett_Endangered_Languages_and_Lost_Knowledge#fullprogram "Endangered Languages and Lost Knowledge"], ''The Long Now Foundation'', San Francisco, March 20, 2009.

They require evidence based on personal experience for every claim made.<ref name="Edge"/> However, they do believe in spirits that can sometimes take on the shape of things in the environment. These spirits can be jaguars, trees, or other visible, tangible things including people.<ref name="Everett 2008" />{{rp|pages=112,134–142}} Everett reported one incident where the Pirahã said that “''Xigagaí'', one of the beings that lives above the clouds, was standing on a beach yelling at us, telling us that he would kill us if we go into the jungle.” Everett and his daughter could see nothing and yet the Pirahã insisted that ''Xigagaí'' was still on the beach.<ref name="Everett 2008" />{{rp|pages=xvi-xvii}}

===Adoption of modern culture===
A 2012 documentary called "The Grammar of Happiness" which aired on the Smithsonian Channel, reported that a school had been opened for the Pirahã community where they learn Portuguese and mathematics. According to [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|FUNAI]] the school is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education of Brazil.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=The Grammar of Happiness |medium=television documentary |publisher=Smithsonian Channel |url=http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/sc/web/show/141519/the-grammar-of-happiness |date=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118143428/http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/sc/web/show/141519/the-grammar-of-happiness |archivedate=2013-11-18 |df= }}</ref> In addition to a formal school being introduced to the culture, the documentary also reported that the Brazilian government installed a modern medical clinic, electricity and television in the remote area.

== Language ==
{{Main|Pirahã language }}
Anthropological linguist [[Daniel Everett]], who wrote the first Pirahã grammar, claims that there are related pairs of curiosities in their language and culture.<ref name="Colapinto">{{cite news | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_colapinto?currentPage=all | title = The Interpreter—Has a remote Amazonian tribe upended our understanding of language? | last = Colapinto | first = John | authorlink = John Colapinto | work = [[The New Yorker]] | date = 16 April 2007 | accessdate = 2009-02-25 }}</ref>

After working with the language for thirty years, Everett states that it has no [[relative clause]]s or [[Recursive grammar|grammatical recursion]]. Everett points out that there is recursion of ideas: that in a story, there may be subordinate ideas inside other ideas. He also pointed out that different experts have different definitions of recursion.<ref name="Edge">{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/everett07/everett07_index.html |title=Recursion and Human Thought: Why the Pirahã Don't Have Numbers |first=Daniel L. |last=Everett |others=Includes discussion by the ''Reality Club''|work=Edge.org|date=11 June 2007 |accessdate=6 July 2016 |department=Conversation |publisher=[[Edge Foundation, Inc.]]}}</ref> If the language lacks grammatical recursion, then it is proposed as a counterexample to the theory proposed by Chomsky, Hauser and Fitch (2002) that recursion is a feature which all human languages must have.

Pirahã is perhaps second only to [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] in [[New Guinea]] for the distinction of having the fewest [[phoneme]]s of any of the world's languages. Women sometimes pronounce ''s'' as ''h'', reducing the inventory still further.<ref name="Everett 2008" />{{rp|pages=178–179.}} Everett states that Pirahã, Rotokas, and Hawaiian each have eleven phonemes.

Their language is a unique living language (it is related to [[Muran languages|Mura]], which is no longer spoken). John Colapinto explains, "Unrelated to any other extant tongue, and based on just eight consonants and three vowels, Pirahã has one of the simplest sound systems known. Yet it possesses such a complex array of tones, stresses, and syllable lengths that its speakers can dispense with their vowels and consonants altogether and sing, hum, or whistle conversations."<ref name="Colapinto"/> Peter Gordon writes that the language has a very complex verb structure: "To the verb stem are appended up to 15 potential slots for morphological markers that encode aspectual notions such as whether events were witnessed, whether the speaker is certain of its occurrence, whether it is desired, whether it was proximal or distal, and so on. None of the markers encode features such as person, number, tense or gender."<ref name="PG-SOM"/>

Curiously, although not unprecedentedly,<ref>{{cite web|last=Pullum |first=Geoffrey K. |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001387.html |title=Language Log: The Straight Ones: Dan Everett on the Pirahã |publisher=Itre.cis.upenn.edu |date=2004-08-26 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}</ref> the language has no cardinal or ordinal numbers. Some researchers, such as Prof. Peter Gordon of Columbia University, claim that the Pirahã are incapable of learning [[numeracy]].  His colleague, Prof. Daniel L. Everett, on the other hand, argues that the Pirahã are cognitively capable of counting; they simply choose not to do so. They believe that their culture is complete and does not need anything from outside cultures. Everett says, "The crucial thing is that the Pirahã have not borrowed any numbers—and they want to learn to count. They asked me to give them classes in Brazilian numbers, so for eight months I spent an hour every night trying to teach them how to count. And it never got anywhere, except for a few of the children. Some of the children learned to do reasonably well, but as soon as anybody started to perform well, they were sent away from the classes. It was just a fun time to eat popcorn and watch me write things on the board."<ref name="Edge"/>

The language does not have words for precise numbers, but rather concepts for a small amount and a larger amount.

The language may have no [[color terms|unique words for colors]], contradicting Berlin and Kay's hypothesis on the [[Basic_Color_Terms:_Their_Universality_and_Evolution|universality of color-naming]]. There are no unanalyzable root words for color; the recorded color words are all compounds like ''mii sai''<ref name="Edge"/> or ''bii sai,'' "blood-like," indicating that colors in the language are adjectival comparisons that are not consistently applied.<ref>{{cite web|last=Everett |first=Daniel |url=http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000427/current.pdf |title=CULTURAL CONSTRAINTS ON GRAMMAR IN PIRAHÃ: A Reply to Nevins, Pesetsky, and Rodrigues |publisher=LingBuzz |date=2007 |accessdate=2018-03-07}}</ref>

It is suspected that the language's entire [[pronoun]] set, which is the simplest of any known language, was recently borrowed from one of the [[Tupí–Guaraní languages]], and that before that the language may have had no pronouns whatsoever.  Many linguists, however, find this claim questionable due to lack of evidence. However, if there had been pronouns at an earlier stage of Pirahã, this would not affect Everett's claim of the significance of the system's simplicity today. There are few Tupi–Guaraní loanwords in areas of the lexicon more susceptible to borrowing (such as nouns referring to cultural items, for instance).
