An '''interlingual homograph''' is a [[word]] that occurs in more than one [[written language]], but which has a different meaning or [[pronunciation]] in each language.<ref name="Kecskes_Albertazzi">{{cite book |editor-last=Kecskes |editor-first=Istvan |editor2-last=Albertazzi |editor2-first=Liliana |year=2007 |title=Cognitive Aspects of Bilingualism |last=Dijkstra |first=Ton |chapter=Task and Context Effects in Bilingual Lexical Processing § Interlingual Homographs |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XuiLxjdmP0C&pg=PA219 |publisher=Springer |page=219 |isbn=978-1-4020-5935-3 |oclc=915958351 |access-date=2017-06-23 |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite thesis |last=Chen |first=Lillian |year=2008 |title=Top-down Effects on Multiple Meaning Access Within and Between Languages |chapter=Background § Language-Selective Access |page=25 |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] |oclc= |chapter-url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/61551/lillianc_1.pdf |access-date=2017-06-23}}</ref>

A ''[[wikt:homograph|homograph]]'' is a word that is written the same as another word, but which (usually) has a different meaning. ''[[wikt:interlingual|Interlingual]]'' means "spanning multiple languages". In some cases, the identical spelling of a word in two languages is coincidental; in other cases, it is because they descend from the same ancestor word. Words that come from the same ancestor are called ''[[cognate]]s''.

Another way of describing interlingual homographs is to say that they are ''orthographically identical'',<ref name="Kecskes_Albertazzi"/> since a language's [[orthography]] describes the rules for writing the language: [[spelling]], [[diacritic]]s, [[capitalization]], [[hyphen]]ation, [[word divider]]s, etc.
