'''Cotard delusion''' is a rare [[mental illness]] in which the affected person holds the delusional belief that they are already dead, do not exist, are [[putrefaction|putrefying]], or have lost their [[blood]] or [[internal organs]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Berrios G.E. |author2=Luque R. | year = 1995 | title = Cotard's delusion or syndrome?. | url = | journal = Comprehensive Psychiatry | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 218–223 | doi=10.1016/0010-440x(95)90085-a}}</ref> Statistical analysis of a hundred-patient cohort indicates that the denial of self-existence is a symptom present in 45% of the cases of Cotard's syndrome; 55% of the patients present delusions of [[immortality]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Berrios G.E. |author2=Luque R. | year = 1995 | title = Cotard Syndrome: Clinical Analysis of 100 Cases | url = | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 185–188 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1995.tb09764.x | pmid=7625193}}</ref>

In 1880, the [[Neurology|neurologist]] [[Jules Cotard]] described the condition as ''Le délire des négations'' ("The Delirium of Negation"), a psychiatric syndrome of varied severity. A mild case is characterized by despair and self-loathing, while a severe case is characterized by intense delusions of negation and chronic psychiatric depression.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2552|Cotard's syndrome}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Berrios G.E. |author2=Luque R. | year = 1999 | title = Cotard's 'On Hypochondriacal Delusions in a Severe form of Anxious Melancholia | url = | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 269–278 | doi=10.1177/0957154x9901003806}}</ref> The case of Mademoiselle X describes a woman who [[Somatoparaphrenia|denied the existence of parts of her body]] and of her need to eat.

==Signs and symptoms==
The delusion of negation is the central symptom in Cotard's syndrome. The patient afflicted with this [[mental illness]] usually denies their own existence, the existence of a certain body part, or the existence of a portion of their body. Cotard's syndrome exists in three stages: (i) Germination stage—the symptoms of [[psychotic depression]] and of [[hypochondria]] appear; (ii) Blooming stage—the full development of the syndrome and the delusions of negation; and (iii) Chronic stage—continued, severe delusions along with chronic psychiatric depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yarnada|first=K.|author2=Katsuragi, S.|author3=Fujii, I.|title=A Case Study of Cotard's syndrome: Stages and Diagnosis|journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica|date=13 November 2007|volume=100|issue=5|pages=396–398|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1999.tb10884.x}}<!--|accessdate=27 May 2014--></ref>

The Cotard syndrome withdraws the afflicted person from other people due to the neglect of their personal hygiene and physical health. The delusion of negation of self prevents the patient from making sense of external reality, which then produces a distorted view of the external world. Such a delusion of negation is usually found in the [[psychosis|psychotic]] patient who also presents with [[schizophrenia]]. Although a diagnosis of Cotard's syndrome does not require the patient's having had hallucinations, the strong delusions of negation are comparable to those found in schizophrenic patients.<ref>Young, A.W., Robertson, I.H., Hellawell, D.J., de, P.K.W., & Pentland, B. (January 01, 1992). Cotard delusion after Brain Injury. ''Psychological Medicine'', 22, 3, 799–804.</ref>

===Distorted reality===
The article ''Betwixt Life and Death: Case Studies of the Cotard Delusion'' (1996) describes a contemporary case of Cotard delusion, which occurred in a Scotsman whose brain was damaged in a motorcycle accident:

{{quote|[The patient's] symptoms occurred in the context of more general feelings of unreality and [of] being dead. In January 1990, after his discharge from hospital in Edinburgh, his mother took him to South Africa. He was convinced that he had been taken to [[Hell]] (which was confirmed by the heat), and that he had died of [[septicemia|septicaemia]] (which had been a risk early in his recovery), or perhaps from [[AIDS]] (he had read a story in ''The Scotsman'' about someone with AIDS who died from septicaemia), or from an overdose of a [[yellow fever]] injection. He thought he had "borrowed [his] mother's spirit to show [him] around hell", and that she was asleep in Scotland.<ref>{{cite book|last=Young |first=A.W.|last2=Leafhead |first2=K.M.|year=1996|chapter=Betwixt Life and Death: Case Studies of the Cotard Delusion|editor-first=P.W. |editor-last=Halligan |editor-first2=J.C. |editor-last2=Marshall |title=Method in Madness: Case studies in Cognitive Neuropsychiatry |location=Hove|publisher=Psychology Press|page=155}}</ref>}}

The article ''Recurrent Postictal Depression with Cotard Delusion'' (2005) describes the case of a fourteen-year-old [[Epilepsy|epileptic]] boy who experienced Cotard syndrome after seizures. His mental health history was of a boy expressing themes of [[death]], chronic sadness, decreased physical activity in playtime, social withdrawal, and disturbed biological functions. About twice a year, the boy suffered episodes that lasted between three weeks and three months. In the course of each episode, he said that everyone and everything was dead (including trees), described himself as a dead body, and warned that the world would be destroyed within hours. Throughout the episode, the boy showed no response to pleasurable stimuli and had no interest in social activities.<ref>Mendhekar, D. N., & Gupta, N. (January 01, 2005). "Recurrent Postictal Depression with Cotard delusion." ''Indian Journal of Pediatrics'', 72, 6, 529–31.</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Gray727 fusiform gyrus.png|thumb|right|Neural misfiring in the fusiform face area, in the [[fusiform gyrus]] (orange), might be a cause of the Cotard delusion.]]
[[File:BrainLobesLabelled.jpg|thumb|right|In the cerebrum, organic lesions in the parietal lobe might cause the Cotard delusion.]]

The underlying [[neurophysiology]] and [[psychopathology]] of Cotard syndrome might be related to problems of delusional misidentification. Neurologically, the Cotard delusion (negation of the Self) is thought to be related to the [[Capgras delusion]] (people replaced by impostors); each type of delusion is thought to result from neural misfiring in the [[fusiform face area]] of the brain (which recognizes faces) and in the [[amygdala]]e (which associate emotions to a recognized face).<ref name = pearn />

The neural disconnection creates in the patient a sense that the face they are observing is not the face of the person to whom it belongs; therefore, that face lacks the familiarity (recognition) normally associated with it. This results in [[derealization]], or a disconnection from the environment. If the observed face is that of a person known to the patient, they experience that face as the face of an impostor (the Capgras delusion). If the patient sees their own face, they might perceive no association between the face and their own sense of [[Self]]—which results in the patient believing that they do not exist (the Cotard delusion).

Cotard's syndrome is usually encountered in people afflicted with a [[psychosis]] (e.g., [[schizophrenia]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morgado|first=Pedro|last2=Ribeiro|first2=Ricardo|last3=Cerqueira|first3=João J.|date=2015|title=Cotard Syndrome without Depressive Symptoms in a Schizophrenic Patient|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/crips/2015/643191/|journal=Case Reports in Psychiatry|language=en|volume=2015|pages=1–3|doi=10.1155/2015/643191|issn=2090-682X}}</ref>), [[neurological illness]], [[mental illness]], [[clinical depression]], [[derealization]], [[brain tumor]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gonçalves|first=Luís Moreira|last2=Tosoni|first2=Alberto|last3=Gonçalves|first3=Luís Moreira|last4=Tosoni|first4=Alberto|date=April 2016|title=Sudden onset of Cotard’s syndrome as a clinical sign of brain tumor|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S0101-60832016000200035&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en|journal=Archives of Clinical Psychiatry (São Paulo)|volume=43|issue=2|pages=35–36|doi=10.1590/0101-60830000000080|issn=0101-6083}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bhatia|first=M.

The Cotard delusion also has resulted from a patient's adverse physiological response to a [[drug]] (e.g., [[aciclovir]]) and to its [[prodrug]] precursor (e.g., [[valaciclovir]]). The occurrence of Cotard delusion symptoms was associated with a high serum-concentration of [[9-Carboxymethoxymethylguanine]] (CMMG), the principal [[metabolite]] of the drug aciclovir. As such, the patient with weak kidneys (impaired [[renal function]]) continued risking the occurrence of delusional symptoms, despite the reduction of the dose of aciclovir. [[Hemodialysis]] resolved the patient's delusions (of negating the Self) within hours of treatment, which suggests that the occurrence of Cotard-delusion symptoms might not always be cause for psychiatric hospitalization of the patient.<ref name = CMMG>{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/335/7633/1305|format=Journal Article|author1=Anders Helldén |author2=Ingegerd Odar-Cederlöf |author3=Kajsa Larsson |author4=Ingela Fehrman-Ekholm |author5=Thomas Lindén |date=December 2007|title=Death Delusion|journal=BMJ|volume=335|issue=7633|pages=1305–1305|doi=10.1136/bmj.39408.393137.BE|pmc = 2151143|pmid = 18156240}}</ref>

== Diagnostic criteria ==
According to the [[DSM-5]] (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition), Cotard delusion falls under the category of [[Delusion#Themes|somatic delusions]], those that involve bodily functions or sensations.{{Citation needed|reason=DSM-5 does not specifically reference Cotard syndrome|date=June 2018}}

There are no further diagnostic criteria for Cotard syndrome within the DSM-5, and identification of the syndrome relies heavily on clinical interpretation.

Cotard delusion should not be confused with [[delusional disorder]]s as defined by the DSM-5, which involve a different spectrum of symptoms that are less severe and have lesser detrimental effect on functioning.

==Treatment==
The article ''Cotard's syndrome: A Review'' (2010) reports successful [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] treatments (mono-therapeutic and multi-therapeutic) using [[antidepressant]], [[antipsychotic]], and [[mood stabilizer|mood stabilizing]] drugs; likewise, with the depressed patient, [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) is more effective than [[pharmacotherapy]].<ref name = Debruyne>{{cite journal|author1=Debruyne H. |author2=Portzky M. |author3=Van den Eynde F. |author4=Audenaert K. | date = June 2010| title = Cotard's syndrome: A Review| journal = Current Psychiatry Reports| volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = 197–202| pmid = 19470281| doi = 10.1007/s11920-009-0031-z}}</ref> Cotard syndrome resulting from an adverse drug reaction to valacyclovir is attributed to elevated serum concentration of one of valacyclovir's metabolites, 9-carboxymethoxymethylguanine (CMMG).  Successful treatment warrants cessation of the drug, valacyclovir.  Hemodialysis was associated with timely clearance of CMMG and resolution of symptoms.

== Case studies ==
* One patient, referred to as WI for privacy reasons, was diagnosed with Cotard delusion after experiencing significant traumatic brain damage. Damage to the cerebral hemisphere, frontal lobe, and the ventricular system was apparent to WI's doctors after examining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. In January 1990, WI was discharged to outpatient care. Although his family had made arrangements for him to travel abroad, he continued to experience significant persistent visual difficulties, which provoked a referral for ophthalmological assessment. Formal visual testing then led to the discovery of further damage. For several months after the initial trauma, WI continued to experience difficulty recognizing familiar faces, places, and objects. He also was convinced that he was dead and experienced feelings of [[derealization]]. Later in 1990, after being discharged from the hospital, WI was convinced that he had been taken to hell after dying of either AIDS or septicemia. When WI finally sought out neurological testing in May 1990, he was no longer fully convinced that he was dead, although he still suspected it. Further testing revealed that WI was able to distinguish between dead and alive individuals with the exception of himself. When WI was treated for depression, his delusions of his own death diminished in a month.<ref>Halligan, P. W., & Marshall, J. C. (2013). Method in madness: Case studies in cognitive neuropsychiatry.
