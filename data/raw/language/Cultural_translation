'''Cultural translation''' is the practice of [[translation]] while respecting and showing cultural differences. This kind of [[translation]] solves some issues linked to culture, such as [[dialects]], food or architecture.

The main issue that cultural translation must solve consists in translating a text as showing cultural differences of this text, in respecting the source culture.

==Translation of cultures==

Cultural translation is studied through cultural [[anthropology]], a field of [[anthropology]] focused on cultural issues among humans. This discipline questions translation through cultural differences. Indeed, [[translation studies]] are not only based on language issues, but also on cultural contexts between peoples.

An [[anthropological]] [[translator]] of cultures needs to deal with the issues between the source and the target language, that is to say he must respect at the same time the cultural source of point of view and the target culture. [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] shared this opinion of [[translation]] in a letter addressed to [[A.W.Schlegel]], dated July 23, 1796:
“All translation seems to me simply an attempt to solve an impossible task. Every translator is doomed to be done in by one of two stumbling blocks: he will either stay too
close to the original, at the cost of taste and the language of his nation, or he will adhere
too closely to the characteristics peculiar to his nation, at the cost of the original.
The medium between the two is not only difficult, but downright impossible”.<ref>{{cite book|last=Humboldt}}</ref>

==Skepticism towards translation of cultures==

Some [[anthropologists]] raise objections to [[translation]] of cultures. According to these [[researchers]], culture seeks a certain coherence that can be found in people’s thinking and [[practice (social theory)|practice]]s.
In this case, a [[culture|cultural]] [[translator]] must have a much more widespread [[knowledge]] than the text actually provides.

Besides, [[translation]] of cultures cannot be as equal as it should be, as some cultures and societies remain dominant compared to others, therefore power is a limit to [[translation]] of cultures. Indeed, within a translation of cultures, the target language may dominate the source culture in order to make the text comprehensible in a sense of culture for the readers. 
The meaning of culture is quite difficult to understand, therefore [[translation]] of cultures is certainly limited, all the more so [[borders]] exist between cultures, which must be thus distinguished. This limit of [[translation]] of cultures was also explained in the [[theory]] of [[Edward Sapir]], an American [[linguist]] and [[anthropologist]] : “The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached”.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Edward Sapir}}</ref> “Each linguistic community has its own perception of the world, which differs from that of other linguistic communities, implies the existence of different worlds determined by language”.

Some [[linguists]] assume that [[untranslatability]] doesn’t only come from [[linguistic]] limits but also from cultural barriers within [[translation]]. 
According to some [[linguists]], such as C.L. Wren, differences of point of view between peoples relatively impose narrow limits to [[cultural translatability]]. The [[theory]] of universal [[translatability]] is therefore disapproved by some [[researchers]], like [[André Martinet]], who is convinced that [[human experience]] cannot be well communicated because it is unique. 
[[Catford]] rationalised this [[theory]] in his book "Linguistic Theory of Translation" : "Cultural untranslatability arises when a situational feature, functionally relevant for the source language text, is completely absent from the culture of which the TL is a part". For instance, the names of some institutions,
clothes, foods and abstract concepts, amongst others."<ref>{{cite book|last=Catford|title=Linguistic Theory of Translation}}</ref>

[[Anton Popovič]] also assumes that there is a difference between [[linguistic]] and [[cultural untranslatability]], an idea that he defends in “A Dictionary for the Analysis of Literary Translation” : “A situation in which the linguistic elements of the original cannot be replaced  adequately in structural, linear, functional or semantic terms in
consequence of a lack of denotation or connotation”.

Dominance of some cultures is consequently obvious within the [[World History]], for instance during the time when [[colonialism]] represented a main ideology among many different countries. Indeed, some cultures were represented as pure and as the essence of the world’s functioning. One should say that [[translation]] of cultures may reflect an inequality between cultures and peoples. 
Furthermore, [[translation]] of cultures provides other issues, such as conflicts between cultures and historical changes.

==A two-fold process==

[[Translation]] may be obviously linked to exchanges, [[Human migration|migration]] and [[Population mobility|mobility]], terms which are the essence of [[globalization]]. Therefore, this [[discipline]] presents a two-fold process, that is to say the [[transnationality|transnational]] (across borders) and translational (exchange of translations) [[concept]]s. This two-fold process withdraws the separation between the source and the target language and enables to negotiate cultural differences.

These global 'negotiations of difference' <ref>Homi K. Bhabha ''The Location of Culture'' (2nd ed.), London, Routledge 2004</ref> are especially crucial in [[postcolonial]] settings and can be read as 'performative negotiations of cultural differences in a process of de- and recontextualization'.<ref>Italiano Rössner ''Translatio/n. Narration, Media and the Staging of Differences'' 2012</ref>

==Culture and civilization==

Cultural [[translation]] obviously implies the notion of culture, which needs here to be defined, in order to understand well the term cultural [[translation]]. 
Culture offers two different meanings: the first one defines culture as a [[civilized]] society in a [[developed country]], whereas the second one considers culture as a whole set of [[behaviors]] and [[ways of life]] that a people shares. As previously explained, culture gets an important role and meaning in [[translation]]. 
According to Katan, culture is a shared [[Conceptual model|model]] of the world, a [[hierarchical]] model of [[beliefs]], [[values]] and strategies which can guide action and [[interaction]] of people. Culture can be acquired  through diverse ways, like education.

The term [[civilization]] is defined as a [[developed]] human society which managed to create its own culture through people. Through this concept, a [[translator]] is able to [[translate]] a [[Written language|text]] by solving the issue of a culture’s development. In this case, [[Peter Newmark|Newmark]] is convinced that [[translation]] is culturally valued, that is to say [[translation]] improves cultures’ development within the entire world. As [[civilization]] lead to the creation of evident ways of communication, such [[alphabet]], [[dictionaries]] and to a tremendous development of [[languages]] and literatures, this process raised new questions in cultural [[translation]].

Culture has a huge influence on society and politics of a country, in terms of ideology. 
According to some [[translation]] [[researchers]] such as [[Even-Zohar]], [[Susan Bassnett]] and [[Trivedi]], culture is also linked to the [[will (philosophy)|will]] of [[power (philosophy)|power]] and to the way people pretend to this power. In this sense, [[translation]] deals with making [[systems]] of ideologies comprehensible for the readers. [[Translation]] of cultures is therefore linked to ethics and explains a new way of thinking. This kind of [[translation]] must show the context and the personal way of thinking through translated texts.
