'''''A New Dictionary of the Terms Ancient and Modern of the Canting Crew''''' is a [[dictionary]] of English [[Cant (language)|cant]] and [[slang]] by a compiler known only by the initials B. E., first published in [[London]] c. 1698. With over 4,000 entries, it was the most extensive dictionary of non-standard English in its time, until it was superseded in 1785 by [[Francis Grose]]'s ''[[Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue]]''.<ref>Coleman (2004): pp. 41–42.</ref> B. E.'s ''New Dictionary'' was used as a source by many subsequent dictionaries.

Its full title is ''A new dictionary of the terms ancient and modern of the canting crew, in its several tribes, of gypsies, beggers, thieves, cheats, &c. with an addition of some proverbs, phrases, figurative speeches, &c.''
