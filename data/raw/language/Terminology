'''Terminology''' is the study of terms and their use. '''Terms''' are [[word]]s and [[compound word]]s or multi-word expressions that in specific contexts are given specific meanings—these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language.{{clarify|date=June 2018|reason=An example and counterexample are needed.}}<ref>a word or expression that has a precise meaning in some uses or is peculiar to a science, art, profession, or subject.{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Term|accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref> Terminology is a discipline that studies, among other things, the development of such terms and their interrelationships within a specialized domain. Terminology differs from [[lexicography]], as it involves the study of [[concept]]s, conceptual systems and their labels (''terms''), whereas lexicography studies words and their meanings.

Terminology is a discipline that systematically studies the "labelling or designating of concepts" particular to one or more subject fields or domains of human activity. It does this through the research and analysis of terms in context for the purpose of documenting and promoting consistent usage. Terminology can be limited to one or more languages (for example, "multilingual terminology" and "bilingual terminology"), or may have an [[interdisciplinarity]] focus on the use of terms in different fields.

==Overview==
The discipline of terminology consists primarily of the following aspects:

* analyzing the concepts and concept structures used in a field or domain of activity
* identifying the terms assigned to the concepts
* in the case of bilingual or multilingual terminology, establishing correspondences between terms in the various languages
* compiling the [[terminology (artifact)|terminology]], on paper or in [[database]]s
* managing [[terminology database]]s
* creating new terms, as required.

==Types of terminology==
A distinction is made between two types of terminology work:
* '''Ad hoc work on terminology''', which deals with a single term or a limited number of terms
* '''Systematic collection of terminology''', which deals with all the terms in a specific subject field or domain of activity, often by creating a structured [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] of the terms within that domain and their interrelationships.

Ad hoc terminology is prevalent in the [[translation]] profession, where a translation for a specific term (or group of terms) is required quickly to solve a particular translation problem.

==Terminology as a discipline==
A ''terminologist'' intends to hone categorical organization by improving the accuracy and content of its terminology. Technical industries and [[standardization]] institutes compile their own glossaries.  This provides the consistency needed in the various areas&mdash;fields and branches, movements and specialties&mdash;to work with core terminology to then offer material for the discipline's traditional and doctrinal literature.

Terminology is also then key in boundary-crossing problems, such as in language translation and [[social epistemology]].
Terminology helps to build bridges and to extend one area into another. [[Translator]]s research the terminology of the languages they translate. Terminology is taught alongside translation in universities and translation schools. Large translation departments and translation bureaus have a ''Terminology'' section.
