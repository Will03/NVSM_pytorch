A '''hydronym''' (from {{lang-el|ὕδωρ}}, {{lang|el-Latn|hydor}}, "water" and {{lang|el|ὄνομα}}, {{lang|el-Latn|onoma}}, "name") is a proper name of a body of water. '''Hydronymy''', a subset of [[toponymy]], the taxonomic study of place-names, is the study of the names of bodies of water, the origins of those names, and how they are transmitted through history. Hydronyms may include the names of rivers (potamonyms<ref>See p. 77 in [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, G.]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]]. [[Palgrave Macmillan]].</ref>), lakes, and even oceanic elements.

Compared to most other toponyms, hydronyms are very conservative linguistically, and people who move to an area often retain the existing name of a body of water rather than rename it in their own language.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Julie Tetel Andresen |author2=Phillip Carter |title=Languages In The World: How History, Culture, and Politics Shape Language |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|date=2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uolxBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA227 |page=227|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref> For example, the [[Rhine]] in [[Germany]] bears a [[Gaulish language|Celtic]] name, not a [[German language|German]] name.

The [[Mississippi River]] in the [[United States]] bears an [[Anishinaabe language|Anishinaabe]] name, not a French or English one.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Arlene B. Hirschfelder |author2=Paulette Fairbanks Molin |title=The Extraordinary Book of Native American Lists |publisher=Scarecrow Press |date=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Un1QWo2Nx8C&pg=PA260 |page=260|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref> The names of large rivers are even more conservative than the local names of small streams.

Therefore, hydronomy may be a tool used to reconstruct past cultural interactions, population movements, religious conversions, or older languages.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Toponymy  |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|date= |url=http://www.britannica.com/science/toponymy |accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref> For example, history professor [[Kenneth H. Jackson]] identified a river-name pattern against which to fit the story of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] invasion of Britain and pockets of surviving native British culture.<ref>Jackson, ''Language and History in Early Britain'', Edinburgh, 1953:220-23, summarized in H.R. Loyn, ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'' , 2nd ed. 1991:7-9.</ref> His river map of Britain divided the island into three principal areas of English settlement: the river valleys draining eastward in which surviving British names are limited to the largest rivers and Saxon settlement was early and dense; the highland spine; and a third region whose British hydronyms apply even to the smaller streams.

Often a given body of water will have several entirely different names given to it by different peoples living along its shores. For example, {{bo|t=་|w=rDza chu|z=Za qu}} and {{lang-th|แม่น้ำโขง}} {{IPA-th|mɛ̂ː náːm kʰǒːŋ|}} are the [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] and [[Thai language|Thai]] names, respectively, for the same river, the [[Mekong]] in [[southeast Asia]]. And the Tibetan term Za Qu (rdza chu) refers to [[:zh:扎曲|three other rivers]] as well.

Hydronyms from various languages may all share a common [[etymology]]. For example, the [[Danube]], [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Dniester]], [[Dnieper]], and [[Donets]] rivers all contain the [[Scythian language|Scythian]] name for "river" (cf. {{lang|os|don}}, "river, water" in modern [[Ossetic]]).<ref name="Mallory, J.P 2000. p. 106">Mallory, J.P. and Victor H. Mair. ''The Tarim Mummies: Ancient China and the Mystery of the Earliest Peoples from the West''. London: Thames and Hudson, 2000. p. 106. [http://i.ironau.ru/pdf/osjazfolk1949.pdf Абаев В. И. Осетинский язык и фольклор ([[Ossetian language]] and folklore). Moscow: Publishing house of Soviet Academy of Sciences, 1949. P. 236]</ref> A similar suggestion is that the [[Jordan River|Yarden]], [[Yarkon River|Yarkon]], and [[Yarmouk River|Yarmouk]] (and possibly, with distortion, [[Zarqa River|Yabbok]] and/or [[Wadi Mujib|Arnon]]) rivers in the [[Israel]]/[[Jordan]] area contain the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word for river (''itrw'', transliterated in the [[Bible]] as ''ye'or'').

It is also possible for a [[toponym]] to become a hydronym: for example, the [[River Liffey]] takes its name from the plain on which it stands, called ''Liphe'' or ''Life''; the river originally was called ''An Ruirthech''.<ref>Byrne, F. J. 1973. Irish Kings and High-Kings. Dublin. p.150</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincastle.ie/history1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020616071414/http://www.dublincastle.ie/history1.html |archivedate=2002-06-16 |df= }}</ref> An unusual example is the [[River Cam]], which originally was called the Granta, but when the town of Grantebrycge became [[Cambridge]], the river's name changed to match the toponym.
