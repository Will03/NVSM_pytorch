The definition overlaps with the [[grammar|grammatical]] term ''[[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]'', but contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence, such as ''do'' and ''not'' to make ''don't'', whereas a portmanteau word is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a singular concept. A portmanteau also differs from a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]], which does not involve the truncation of parts of the [[stem (linguistics)|stems]] of the blended words. For instance, ''starfish'' is a compound, not a portmanteau, of ''star'' and ''fish''; whereas a hypothetical portmanteau of ''star'' and ''fish'' might be ''stish''.

== Origin ==
The word ''portmanteau'' was first used in this sense by [[Lewis Carroll]] in the book ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1871),<ref name="oed">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2010 |title =portmanteau, ''n.'' |encyclopedia= Oxford English Dictionary, third edition |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/148217 |accessdate =23 February 2011}}</ref> in which [[Humpty Dumpty]] explains to Alice the coinage of the unusual words in "[[Jabberwocky]]",<ref name="multiple">Fromkin, V., Rodman, R., and Hyams, N. (2007) ''An Introduction to Language'', Eighth Edition. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth. {{ISBN|1-4130-1773-8}}.</ref> where ''slithy'' means "slimy and lithe" and ''mimsy'' is "miserable and flimsy". Humpty Dumpty explains to Alice the practice of combining words in various ways:

{{Quote|You see it's like a portmanteau—there are two meanings packed up into one word.}}

In his introduction to ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', Carroll uses ''portmanteau'' when discussing [[Blend word|lexical selection]]:

{{quote|Humpty Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all. For instance, take the two words "fuming" and "furious." Make up your mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will say first … if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say "frumious."<ref name="multiple" />}}

In then-contemporary English, a portmanteau was a [[Portmanteau (suitcase)|suitcase]] that opened into two equal sections. The etymology of the word is the French ''porte-manteau'', from ''porter'', "to carry", and ''manteau'', "cloak" (from Old French ''mantel'', from Latin ''mantellum'').<ref>"Portmanteau." ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.'' 2000.</ref> In modern French, a ''porte-manteau'' is a [[clothes valet]], a coat-tree or similar article of furniture for hanging up jackets, hats, umbrellas and the like.<ref>[[Petit Robert]]: ''portemanteau'' – "malle penderie" (suitcase in which clothes hang)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/portemanteau|title= PORTEMANTEAU : Définition de PORTEMANTEAU|work= cnrtl.fr|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140821190449/http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/portemanteau|archivedate= 21 August 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Such a "coat bag" is mentioned in Chapter 12 of Alexander Dumas' ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''.</ref>

An occasional synonym for "portmanteau word" is ''frankenword'', an [[autological word]] exemplifying the phenomenon it describes, blending "[[Frankenstein]]" and "word".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2016/feb/05/frankenwords-portmanteau-blend-words "Frankenwords: They're Alive!"

== Examples in English ==
{{Main|List of portmanteaus}}

=== Standard English ===
==== Formal ====
[[File:The Gerry-Mander Edit.png|thumb|right|The original "[[Gerrymander]]" pictured in an 1812 cartoon. The word is a portmanteau of Massachusetts Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]]'s name with [[Salamander (legendary creature)|"salamander."]]]]
Many [[neologism]]s are examples of blends, but many blends have become part of the lexicon.<ref name="multiple" /> In ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1896, the word [[brunch]] (breakfast + lunch) was introduced as a "portmanteau word."<ref>''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]],'' 1 August 1896, 58/2</ref> In 1964, the newly independent African republic of [[Tanganyika]] and [[Zanzibar]] chose the portmanteau word [[Tanzania]] as its name. Similarly [[Eurasia]] is a portmanteau of Europe and Asia.

Some city names are portmanteaus of the border regions they straddle: [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]] spreads across the Texas-Arkansas border, while [[Calexico, California|Calexico]] and [[Mexicali]] are respectively the American and Mexican sides of a single [[conurbation]]. A scientific example is a ''[[liger]],'' which is a cross between a male [[lion]] and a female [[tiger]] (a ''[[tigon]]'' or ''tiglon'' is a similar cross in which the male is a tiger).

Many company or brand names are portmanteaus, including [[Microsoft]], a portmanteau of [[microcomputer]] and [[software]]; the cheese "[[Cambozola]]" combines a similar rind to "[[Camembert]]" with the same mold used to make "[[Gorgonzola]]"; passenger rail company "[[Amtrak]]", a portmanteau of "[[United States|America]]" and "[[Track (rail transport)|track]]"; "[[Velcro]]", a portmanteau of the French "Velours" (velvet) and "Crochet" (hook); "[[Verizon]]," a portmanteau of "veritas" (Latin for truth) and "horizon"; and [[ComEd]] (a [[Chicago]]-area electric utility company), a portmanteau of "Commonwealth" and Edison ([[Thomas Edison]]).

"Jeoportmanteau!" is a recurring category on the American television [[quiz show]] ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. The category's name is itself a portmanteau of the words "Jeopardy" and "portmanteau." Responses in the category are portmanteaus constructed by fitting two words together.

==== Informal ====
Portmanteau words may be produced by joining together [[proper nouns]] with common nouns, such as "[[gerrymandering]]", which refers to the scheme of Massachusetts Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]] for politically contrived redistricting; the perimeter of one of the districts thereby created resembled a very curvy [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]] in outline. The term gerrymander has itself contributed to portmanteau terms [[bjelkemander]] and [[playmander]].

[[Oxbridge]] is a common portmanteau for the UK's two oldest universities, those of [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]. In 2016, ''Britain''{{'}}s planned [[withdrawal from the European Union|''exit'' from the European Union]] became known as "''[[Brexit]]".'' [[David Beckham]]'s English mansion Rowneybury House was nicknamed "Beckingham Palace", a portmanteau of his surname and [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inside-beckingham-palace-david-victorias-3247500 | title=Inside 'Beckingham Palace': David and Victoria's mansion bought by insurance tycoon for £11.3million | newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] | location=UK | first=Patrick | last=Hill | date=15 March 2014 | accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Spork.jpg|thumb|right|A [[spork]]]]

Many portmanteau words receive some use but do not appear in all dictionaries. For example, a ''[[spork]]'' is an eating utensil that is a combination of a spoon and a fork, and a ''[[skort]]'' is an item of clothing that is part [[skirt]], part [[shorts]]. On the other hand, ''[[turducken]]'', a dish made by inserting a chicken into a duck, and the duck into a turkey, was added to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' in 2010.

Similarly, the word ''refudiate'' was first used by [[Sarah Palin]] when she misspoke, conflating the words ''refute'' and ''repudiate''. Though initially a gaffe, the word was recognized as the ''New Oxford American Dictionary''{{'}}s "Word of the Year" in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY'S 2010 WORD OF THE YEAR IS...|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2010/11/noad-2010-word-of-the-year/|accessdate=30 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116163439/http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2010/11/noad-2010-word-of-the-year/|archivedate=16 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==== Business ====
The business lexicon is replete with newly coined portmanteau words like "permalance" (permanent freelance), "advertainment" (advertising as entertainment), "advertorial" (a blurred distinction between advertising and editorial), "infotainment" (information about entertainment or itself intended to entertain by virtue of its manner of presentation), and "infomercial" (informational [[Television advertisement|commercial]]).

A company name may also be portmanteau (e.g., ''Timex'' is a portmanteau of ''Time'' (referring to [[Time magazine]]) and [[Kleenex]])<ref name="kleenex">{{cite web

=== Non-standard English ===
==== Name-meshing ====
{{main|Name blending}}
Two proper names can also be used in creating a portmanteau word in reference to the partnership between people, especially in cases where both persons are well-known, or sometimes to produce [[epithet]]s such as "Billary" (referring to former United States president [[Bill Clinton]] and his wife, former United States Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]). In this example of recent American political history, the purpose for blending is not so much to combine the meanings of the source words but "to suggest a resemblance of one named person to the other"; the effect is often derogatory, as linguist [[Benjamin Zimmer]] states.<ref>{{cite web |last= Zimmer |first= Benjamin |authorlink= Benjamin Zimmer |title= A perilous portmanteau? |work= [[Language Log]] |publisher= [[University of Pennsylvania]] |date= 1 November 2005 |url= http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002610.html |accessdate= 11 November 2008 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081229180953/http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002610.html |archivedate= 29 December 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> By contrast, the public, including the media, use portmanteaus to refer to their favorite pairings as a way to "...giv[e] people an essence of who they are within the same name."<ref name="news.BBC.co.uk">{{cite news|first=Denise|last=Winterman|title=What a mesh|publisher=BBC News Magazine|date=3 August 2006|accessdate=17 July 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5239464.stm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216171930/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5239464.stm|archivedate=16 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This is particularly seen in cases of fictional and real-life "[[supercouple]]s".

Holidays are another example, as in [[Thanksgivukkah]], a portmanteau neologism given to the convergence of the American holiday of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and the first day of the [[Jewish holiday]] of [[Hanukkah]] on Thursday, 28 November 2013.<ref>{{cite web |author=Christine Byrne |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/thanksgivukkah |title=How To Celebrate Thanksgivukkah, The Best Holiday Of All Time |publisher=Buzzfeed |date=2 October 2013 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009221928/http://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/thanksgivukkah |archivedate=9 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Stu Bykofsky |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20131011_Thanks_for_Thanukkah_.html |title=Thanks for Thanukkah! |publisher=Philly.com |date=22 October 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014085041/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20131011_Thanks_for_Thanukkah_.html |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

For the Disney film ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'', there is a location called "San Fransokyo", a fusion between [[San Francisco]] and [[Tokyo]].

== Other languages ==
=== Arabic ===
In vernacular Arabic, contractions are a pretty common phenomenon, in which mostly prepositions are added to other words to create a word with a new meaning.
For example, the [[Hejazi Arabic|Hejazi]] word for "not yet" is لسع/لسه (lessa/lessaʕ), which is a combination of the words لـ (li, for) and الساعة (assaʕa, the hour). Other examples in [[Hejazi Arabic]] include:
*إيش (ʔēš, what), from أي (ʔay, which) and شيء (šayʔ, thing).
*ليش (lēš, why), from لـ (li, for) and أي (ʔay, which) and شيء (šayʔ, thing).
*معليش (maʕlēš, is it ok?/sorry), from ما (mā, nothing) and عليه (ʕalayh, on him) and شيء (šayʔ, thing).
*فين (fēn, where), from في (fī, in) and أين (ʔayn, where).
*دحين (daḥēn or daḥīn, now), from ذا (ḏā, this) and الحين (alḥīn, part of time).
*إلين (ʔilēn, until), from إلى (ʔilā, to) and أن (ʔan, that).
*بعدين (baʕdēn, later), from بَعْد (baʕd, after) and أََيْن (ʔayn, part of time).
*علشان/عشان (ʕašān/ʕalašān, because), from على (ʕalā, on) and شأن (šaʔn, matter).
*كمان (kamān, also/more), from كما (kamā as) and أن (ʔan that).
*إيوه (ʔīwa, yes), from إي (ʔī, yes) and و (wa, swear to or promise by) and الله (allāh, God).<ref>[[Wallah (Arabic)]]</ref>{{clarify| Should the pronunciation be ʔīwah? Does any part of  الله  show up in the portmanteau?|date=August 2017}}
A few rare or facetious examples would include:

*متشائل {{Pronunciation needed}} ("mutashaʔim", pessimist) and ("mutafaʔil", optimist), the title of a novel published by Emile Habibi in 1974. The title is translated in English to "The Pessoptimist."

=== Bulgarian ===
In the Bulgarian language, the most common use of portmanteau (''in Bulgarian: "портманто" [portmanto′]'') is as a word describing a typical furniture for a vestibule in an apartment. It is a coat hook together with a shoe cabinet below it upon which you can leave your belongings such as keys, hat, scarf, gloves, handbag, etc. In Bulgarian this word is not used to describe a blend of words as it is in English, although this linguistic phenomenon is seen here as well. You can also find new terms in Bulgarian formed by binding two words. Some of them are invented for the sake of [[advertising]] campaigns. One such example is the word ''gintuition'' (''джинтуиция'' pronounced dzhintuitsia), which is made up from the words ''gin'' and ''intuition''. This one, in particular, is used, not surprisingly, as a part of a [[gin]] [[Television advertisement|commercial]]. Another example is the word ''charomat'', which consists of the words ''чар'' (the Bulgarian word for charm) and ''аромат'' (meaning aroma), made popular by an ad about a [[coffee]] brand.

=== Filipino ===
Certain portmanteaus in Filipino have come into use to describe popular combinations of items in a Filipino breakfast. An example of such a combination order is kankamtuy: an order of kanin (rice), kamatis (tomatoes) and tuyo (dried fish). Another is tapsi: an order of tapa and sinangág. Other examples include variations using a silog suffix, usually some kind of meat served with sinangág and itlog ([[egg]]). The three most commonly seen silogs are tapsilog (having tapa as the meat portion), tocilog (having [[tocino]] as the meat portion), and longsilog (having [[Longaniza#Philippines|longganisa]] as the meat portion). Other silogs include hotsilog (with a hot dog), bangsilog (with bangus ([[milkfish]])), dangsilog (with danggit ([[rabbitfish]])), spamsilog (with [[Spam (food)|Spam]]), adosilog (with adobo), chosilog (with chorizo), chiksilog (with chicken), cornsilog (with [[corned beef]]), and litsilog (with [[lechon]]/litson). An establishment that specializes in such meals is called a tapsihan or "tapsilugan".

The name of a common Filipino mongrel dogs [[askal]] is derived from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] words "asong kalye" or "street dog" because these dogs are commonly seen in streets. Askals are also called "aspins", a combination of "asong [[Pinoy]]" or "Philippine Dog".

Another Filipino portmanteau is a popular but slightly dated female name [[Luzviminda]] derived from [[Philippines|the Philippines]]' three major island groups [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]].

Many Filipinos are very fond of speaking in Tagalog with some English words and thus are actually speaking in [[Taglish]]. Tagalog is a dialect in the island of Luzon and the basis for the national language Filipino.

=== French ===
Despite its French etymology (modern spelling: portemanteau), ''portmanteau'' is not used in French in this context. It is indeed a [[false friend]]. It refers to a coat stand or coat hook (literally a "coat support"), but in the past, it could also refer to a cloth drape knights would use to pack their gear. It was in this context that it first came to its English use, and the metaphorical use of a linguistic phenomenon (putting one word inside another, as into a case) is an English coinage. The French linguistic term ''mot-valise'', literally a "suitcase-word", is a relatively recent back-translation from English, attested only since 1970.

Although French of France is regulated by the [[Académie française]] (which has had a conservative attitude to neologisms) it produced a number of portmanteau words such as ''franglais'' (frenglish) or ''courriel'' (''courrier électronique'' = email) and has used the technique in literature ([[Boris Vian]]) or to create brands: ''Transilien'' (''Transports franciliens'' = [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] transportation system).<ref>The name also combines the word ''lien'' (link)</ref>

French in Canada has a second regulatory body, named [[OQLF]], an agency of the Government of [[Quebec]], which is independent of the Académie. It has a tendency to produce neologisms in order to replace anglicisms. It created the portmanteaus ''courriel'' and ''clavardage'' (''clavier'' + ''bavardage''), for example.{{clarify | reason= What does "courriel" come from? And what do all of these words mean?|date=August 2017}} Another example in Quebec (but made outside of OQLF) is ''Centricois'', which means ''person from the region Centre-du-Québec'' (winner of a contest organised by the [[SSJB]] of Centre-du-Québec in 1999).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

=== Galician ===
Galician has many portmanteaus, some existing also in Portuguese but many others not (or only in the North of Portugal, close to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), which can be explained by its popular origin: ''carambelo'' (frozen candy), from ''caramelo'' (candy) and ''carámbano'' (icicle); ''martabela'' (a kind of dead bolt), from ''martelo'' (hammer) and ''tarabela'' (a kind of drill bit); ''rabuñar'' (to scratch with a fingernail, for instance a cat or a person), from ''rabuxa'' (a small tail, and also a common ill in tails) and ''rañar'' (to scratch); ''millenta'' ("many thousands", also common in Portuguese ''milhenta''), from ''milleiro'' (one thousand) and ''cento'' (one hundred); ''runxir'' (to crackle, applied to some things only), from ''ruxir'' (to howl) and ''renxer'' (to grind the teeth), or ''vagamundo'' (tramp), from ''vagabundo'' (wanderer) and ''mundo'' (world), currently "vagamundo" and "vagabundo" mean the same, and the former is considered a vulgarism{{clarify|date=December 2014}}.

=== German ===
''Kofferwort'', a German synonym for portmanteau, is a recent literal translation of French ''mot-valise'', attested since 1983. However, the phenomenon is well known in German poetry. An example of German portmanteau is 'Teuro', combining 'teuer' (expensive) and 'Euro'.
Other examples are [[Mainhattan]], a [[Central business district]] in [[Frankfurt]] on the river [[Main (river)|Main]] like [[Manhattan|Manhattan, New York]] and Kreuzkölln, the Berlin area bordering between [[Kreuzberg]] and [[Neukölln]]. 'Jein' is a widely used contraction of 'Ja' (yes) and 'Nein' (no), to indicate a combination of the two.

=== Modern Hebrew ===
[[Modern Hebrew]] abounds with European mechanisms such as blending: Along with {{Hebrew|קומפקט דיסק}}} (''kompaktdisk'', compact disc), Hebrew has the blend {{Hebrew|תקליטור}} (''taklitor''), which consists of the Jewish-descent {{Hebrew|תקליט}} (''taklít'', record) and {{Hebrew|אור}} (''or'', light). Modern Hebrew is full of portmanteau blends, such as the following:<ref>See p. 62 in [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2009), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns], ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2 (2009), pp. 40–67.</ref>
*{{Hebrew|ערפיח}} (''arpíakh'', smog), from {{Hebrew|ערפל}} (''arafél'', fog) and {{Hebrew|פיח}} (''píakh'', soot)
*{{Hebrew|מדרחוב}} (''midrakhov'', (pedestrian) promenade), from {{Hebrew|מדרכה}} (''midrakhá'', footpath) and {{Hebrew|רחוב}} (''rekhóv'', street)
*{{Hebrew|מחזמר}} (''makhazémer'', musical), from {{Hebrew|מחזה}} (''makhazé'', play [noun]) and {{Hebrew|זמר}} (''zémer'', song)

Other blends include the following:

*{{Hebrew|מגדלור}} (''migdalór'', lighthouse), from {{Hebrew|מגדל}} (''migdál'', tower) and {{Hebrew|אור}} (''or'', light)
*{{Hebrew|רמזור}} (''ramzór'', traffic light), from {{Hebrew|רמז}} (''rémez'', signal) and {{Hebrew|אור}} (''or'', light)

Sometimes the root of the second word is truncated, giving rise to a blend that resembles an [[acrostic]]:
*{{Hebrew|תפוז}} (''tapúz'', orange (fruit), from {{Hebrew|תפוח}} (''tapúakh'', apple) and {{Hebrew|זהב}} (''zaháv'', gold)

===Irish===
A few portmanteaus are in use in modern [[Irish language|Irish]], for example:
*[[Brexit]] is referred to as ''Breatimeacht'' (from ''Breatain'', "[[United Kingdom|Britain]]", and ''imeacht'', "leave") or ''Sasamach'' (from ''Sasana'', "[[England]]," and ''amach'', "out")<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/the-irish-words-for-selfie-brexit-and-spam-1.3160155|title=The Irish words for ‘selfie’, ‘Brexit’ and ‘spam’|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/making-sense-of-brexit-1.3040836|title=Making sense of Brexit|publisher=}}</ref>

=== Portuguese ===
On [[Brazilian Portuguese]], portmanteaus are usually slangs, some of them include:

* ''Cantriz'', from ''cantora'' (female singer) and ''atriz'' (actress), which defines women that both sing and act.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://istoe.com.br/103725_A+HORA+DAS+CANTRIZES/|title=A hora das cantrizes - ISTOÉ Independente|date=2010-10-04|work=ISTOÉ Independente|access-date=2018-04-15|language=pt-BR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tititi.uol.com.br/noticias/perfil/consegui-realizar--meu-grande-sonho-ser-cantriz.phtml|title="Consegui realizar meu grande sonho: ser cantriz!"|date=2016-02-20|work=Tititi|access-date=2018-04-15|language=pt-BR}}</ref>
* ''Aborrescente'', from ''aborrecer'' (annoy) and ''adolescente'' (teenager), which is a pejorative term for teenagers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kid-bentinho.blogspot.com/2011/03/o-que-e-uma-palavra-valise.html|title=O que é uma palavra-valise?|website=Kid Bentinho|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dicionarioinformal.com.br/aborrescente/|title=Significado de Aborrescente|website=www.dicionarioinformal.com.br|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref>
* ''Pescotapa'', from ''pescoço'' (neck) and ''tapa'' (slap), which defines a slap on the back of the neck.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://noticias.bol.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/brasil/2018/04/10/pescotapa-de-ciro-gomes-repercute-nas-redes-apoiadores-afirmam-que-imagens-foram-manipuladas.htm|title="Pescotapa" de Ciro Gomes repercute nas redes; apoiadores afirmam que vídeo foi manipulado - Brasil - BOL Notícias|website=noticias.bol.uol.com.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dicionarioinformal.com.br/pescotapa/|title=Significado de Pescotapa|website=www.dicionarioinformal.com.br|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref>

On [[European Portuguese]], portmanteaus are also used. Some of them include:

* ''Telemóvel'', which means [[mobile phone]], comes from ''telefone'' ([[telephone]]) and ''móvel'' (mobile).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguee.com/portuguese-english/translation/telem%C3%B3vel.html|title=telemóvel - English translation – Linguee|website=Linguee.com|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref>
* ''Cantautor'', which means [[Singer-songwriter]], and comes from ''cantor'' (singer) and ''autor'' (songwriter).

=== Hindi ===
A portmanteau common in both Hindi and English is [[Hinglish]], which refers to the [[vernacular]] of the people in (the Hindi-speaking regions of) North India, where they mix Hindi and English in the spoken language.

Another modern day example is the [[BrahMos]] missile, whose name is a portmanteau of two rivers, [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Moskva River|Moskva]].

Compounds displaying [[Sanskrit]]ic [[sandhi]] are extremely commonplace in Hindi, but as compounds showing sandhi still consist of multiple [[morpheme]]s, these are not portmanteaus.

=== Hungarian ===
In Hungarian language, the first decades of the 19th century saw the language-reforming movement (Hungarian: ''nyelvújítás''), when some authors and poets, like Ferenc Kazinczy, Pál Bugát, Mihály Fazekas, Miklós Révai and others created approximately 10,000 new words and phrases in order to develop Hungarian language to a modern and progressive tongue. Among these new phrases there are some portmanteaus:

''gyufa'' (safety matches), consists of ''gyújtó'' (burner) and ''fa'' (wood).

=== Icelandic ===
There is a tradition of [[linguistic purism in Icelandic]], and [[neologism]]s are frequently created from pre-existing words. For example, ''Tölva'' ("computer") is a ''portmanteau'' of ''tala'' ("digit; number") and ''völva'' ("oracle or seeress").<ref>Kristján Árnason; Sigrún Helgadóttir (1991), "Terminology and Icelandic Language Policy", Behovet och nyttan av terminologiskt arbete på 90-talet, Nordterm 5, Nordterm-symposium, pp. 7–21</ref>

=== Indonesian ===
In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], portmanteaus are often used as both formal and informal [[acronym]]s and referrals. Many organizations and government bodies use them for brevity. Journalists often create portmanteaus for particular historical moments. Examples include:

Formal and journalism uses:
* ''Golput'': voters who abstain from voting, from ''Gol''ongan ''Put''ih, "blank party" or "white party".<ref name="nytVocabBlog">{{cite news |url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/golput/ |title=Golput – Schott’s Vocab Blog – NYTimes.com |work=The New York Times |accessdate=19 June 2009 |date=17 February 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20110209130859/http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/golput/ |archivedate=9 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
* ''[[Jagorawi Toll Road|Jagorawi]]'': a motorway linking the cities of [[Jakarta|''Ja''karta]], [[Bogor|Bo''gor'']] and Ci''awi''.
* ''[[Jabodetabek]]'': the neighboring cities of Jakarta, consisting of ''Ja''karta, ''Bo''gor, [[Depok|''De''pok]], [[Tangerang|''Ta''ngerang]], [[Bekasi|''Bek''asi]], and sometimes [[Cianjur|Cian''jur'']] (Jabodetabekjur).
* The [[Suramadu Bridge]] connects the cities of [[Surabaya|''Sura''baya]] and [[Madura|''Madu''ra]]
* "[[Malari incident|Malari]]": refers to "Malapetaka 15 Januari" – a social riot that happened on 15 January 1974.
* Military units, e.g. ''[[Kopassus]]'' [[Indonesian Army|army]] special forces unit, from ''Ko''mando ''Pas''ukan Khu''sus'', "[[special forces]] command". Another example is the ''[[Kopaska]]'' [[Indonesian Navy|navy]] [[frogman]] unit, from ''Ko''mando ''Pas''ukan ''Ka''tak, "Frogman Command".
* Governmental bodies, e.g. "Kemdikbud", refers to "Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan" (Education and Culture Ministry), where the ministry leader is called "Mendikbud", "Menteri Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan" (Minister of Education and Culture).

Informal uses, for example:
* ''Asbun'' = ''As''al ''bun''yi: carelessly speaking
* ''Mafia'' = ''ma''tematika + ''fi''sika + kimi''a'': math, physics, and chemistry, three school subjects that are often related with arithmetic
* ''Caper'' = ''ca''ri ''per''hatian: attention seeker
* ''Warnet'' = ''war''ung inter''net'': internet cafe
* ''[[Alay]]'' = ''a''nak ''lay''angan: unfashionable people
* ''Copas'' = ''Co''py ''pas''te: copying other people's work without permission
* ''Ropang'' = ''ro''ti ''pang''gang: toasted bread
* ''Nasgor'' = [[nasi goreng|''nas''i ''gor''eng]]

=== Japanese ===
A very common type of portmanteau in Japanese forms one word from the beginnings of two others (that is, from two [[clipping (morphology)|back-clippings]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/contractions.html |title=What are contracted words like rimokon? |publisher=Sljfaq.org |date= |accessdate=3 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232800/http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/contractions.html |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The portion of each input word retained is usually two [[on (Japanese prosody)|morae]], which is tantamount to one [[kanji]] in most words written in kanji.

The inputs to the process can be native words, [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese words]], [[gairaigo]] (later borrowings), or combinations thereof. A Sino-Japanese example is the name {{nihongo|東大||''Tōdai''}} for the [[University of Tokyo]], in full {{nihongo|'''東'''京'''大'''学||'''''Tō'''kyō '''dai'''gaku''}}. With borrowings, typical results are words such as {{nihongo|パソコン||''pasokon''}}, meaning personal computer (PC), which despite being formed of English elements does not exist in English; it is a [[wasei-eigo|uniquely Japanese]] contraction of the English {{nihongo|''personal computer''|'''パ'''ー'''ソ'''ナル'''・コン'''ピュータ|'''pāso'''naru '''kon'''pyūta}}. Another example, {{nihongo|''[[Pokémon]]''|ポケモン}}, is a contracted form of the English words {{nihongo|''pocket''|'''ポケ'''ット|'''poke'''tto}} and {{nihongo|''monsters''|'''モン'''スター|'''mon'''sutā}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sfu.ca/gradlings/SFUWPL/ICEAL2/Rosen_E.pdf |title=Japanese loanword accentuation: epenthesis and foot form interacting through edge-interior alignment∗ |first=Eric |last=Rosen |work=University of British Columbia |publisher=sfu.ca |accessdate=25 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131040/http://www.sfu.ca/gradlings/SFUWPL/ICEAL2/Rosen_E.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A famous example of a blend with mixed sources is {{nihongo|''[[karaoke]]''|カラオケ|karaoke}}, blending the Japanese word for {{nihongo|''empty''|空|'''kara'''}} and the Greek word {{nihongo|''orchestra''|オーケストラ|'''ōke'''sutora}}.

Some Anime titles also are portmanteaus, such as [[Hetalia]] (ヘタリア). It came from Hetare (ヘタレ) which means "idiot" and Itaria (イタリア) which means [[Italy]], and for the anime [[Servamp]]
which came from the English words Servant (サヴァント) and Vampire (ヴァンパイア).

=== Spanish ===
Although not very common in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]{{citation needed|reason=Maribel: María Isabel/María Belén; Marisa: María Isabel; Marisé/Mariajo: María José; Marina: María Cristina; Marichu: Maria Jesús; Maica/Mamen: Mari(a) Carmen; Is this not very common?|date=May 2018}} (except for a pair of compulsory contractions, 'a el'='al' and 'de el'='del'), portmanteaus are finding their way into the language mainly through marketing and media efforts, such as in [[Mexican Spanish]] 'cafebrería' from 'cafetería' and 'librería', or Teletón from 'televisión' and 'maratón'. However, it is very frequent in commercial brands of any type (for instance, "chocolleta", from "chocolate" + "galleta", cookie), and above all family-owned business (of small size, for instance: Rocar, from "Roberto" + "Carlos", and Mafer, from "Maria" + "Fernanda"). Such usages are obviously prompted by the registering of a distinguishable trademark, but with time is common that a specific trademark became the name of the all similar products, like in [[Cola Cao]], a name which is very common to use to refer any similar product. Examples of a portmanteau in Spanish includes the word ''ofimática'' (office automation), a blend of the words ''oficina'' (office) and ''informática'' (computing).

A somewhat popular example in Spain is the word [[Gallifante]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/para-todos-la-2/gallifantes/1030400//|title=Gallifantes - RTVE.es|date=25 February 2011|publisher=}}</ref> a portmanteau of Gallo y Elefante (Cockerel and Elephant). It was the prize on the Spanish version of the children TV show [[Child's Play (Spanish TV series)|Child's Play]] ([[Juego de niños]])<ref>[[:es:Juego de niños (programa de televisión)]]</ref>{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=March 2018}} that ran on the public television channel [[La 1 (Spanish TV channel)|La 1]] of [[Televisión Española|Televisión Española (TVE)]] from 1988 to 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1988/06/04/radiotv/581378404_850215.html|title=Jugar bien vale un 'gallifante'|first=Ediciones El|last=País|date=4 June 1988|publisher=|via=elpais.com}}</ref>

=== Tibetan ===
Neologisms are also frequently created from pre-existing words in the [[Tibetan languages]]. For example, ''kubkyab'' (the common word for "chair") combines the words ''kub'' ("butt"), ''ky''ag ("a stand"), and gy''ab'' nye ("cushion," often for the back). Gyabnye is itself a blend of ''gyab''ten ("back support") and ''nye''ba, the verb for "lean against, recline, rest on." Thus the word for chair is "a standing support for one's butt and back to rest on." Tibetan also employs portmanteaus frequently in names of important figures and spiritual practices, such as His Holiness Penor Rinpoche, with Penor being ''pe''ma ''nor''bu ("lotus jewel"), and the Buddhist practice of Dzogchen, or ''dzog''pa ''chen''po, the "Great Perfection." Tibetan is rich with portmanteaus.

== Word/morph (linguistics) ==
In linguistics, the term blend is used to refer to the general combination of words, and the term ''portmanteau'' is reserved for the narrow sense of combining two or more [[morpheme]]s in one morph{{citation needed|reason=One is lexical, another is morpohological|date=May 2018}}. E.g. in the Latin word ''animalis'' the ending ''-is'' is a portmanteau morph because it is used for two morphemes: the singularity and the genitive case. In English two separate morphs are used ('''''of an''' animal'').

The term may also be extended to include (written) [[contraction (grammar)|contractions]]. Examples of such combinations include:

This usage has been referred to as "portmanteau morph".<ref name="What is a portmanteau morph" />

While in Portuguese, French, Spanish and Italian the use of the short forms is obligatory (with the exception of ''ès'' in French, which is archaic in most senses), German and Cornish speakers theoretically may freely choose the form they use. In German, ''portmanteaus'' clearly dominate in spoken language, whilst in written language, both forms are in use.
