'''Ecosemiotics''' is a branch of [[semiotics]] in its intersection with [[human ecology]] that studies the sign relations established by culture, which deal with other living beings, communities, and landscapes.<ref>Farina, Almo; Santolini, Riccardo; Pagliaro, Giacomo; Scozzafava, Silvia; Schipani, Ileana 2005. Ecosemiotics: A new field of competence for ecology to overcome the frontier between environmental complexity and human culture in the Mediterranean. ''Israel Journal of Plant Sciences'' 53(3/4): 167–175.</ref>

The field was initiated by [[Winfried Nöth]] and [[Kalevi Kull]].<ref>*Maran, Timo 2007. Towards an integrated methodology of ecosemiotics: The concept of nature-text. ''Sign Systems Studies'' 35(1/2): 269–294.</ref>

The central focus of ecosemiotics concerns the role of concepts (sign-based models people have) in designing and changing the environment. Ecosemiotics includes (or largely overlaps) with semiotics of landscape.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/11557974/Landscape_semiotics Lindström, Kati; Kull, Kalevi; Palang, Hannes 2014.
