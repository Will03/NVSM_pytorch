The study of '''ancient Greek personal names''' is a branch of [[onomastics]], the study of names,<ref>E. Eichler and others, ''Namenforschung'', 3 vols., 1995</ref> and more specifically of [[anthroponymy|anthroponomastics]], the study of names of persons.  There are hundreds of thousands and even millions of [[Greek name]]s on record, making them an important resource for any general study of naming, as well as for the study of [[ancient Greece]] itself.  The names are found in literary texts, on coins and stamped [[amphora]] handles, on potsherds used in [[Ostracism|ostracisms]], and, much more abundantly, in inscriptions and (in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]) on [[Papyrus|papyri]].  This article will concentrate on Greek naming from the 8th century BC, when the evidence begins, to the end of the 6th century AD.<ref>O. Masson, 'Les noms propres d'homme en grec ancien', in E. Eichler and others, ''Namenforschung'', vol. I (1995), 706-710</ref>

== Single names and names within families ==
[[File:1238 - Keramikos Museum, Athens - Ostrakon against Aristides, son of Lysimachos - Photo by Giovanni Dall CROPPED.jpg|thumb|A 5th century BC [[Ostracon|ostrakon]]: a pot shard bearing the name of a politician proposed for [[ostracism]] (exile). The individual name Aristides and [[patronym]] Lysimachos together mean "Aristides, son of Lysimachos"]]
[[Ancient Greeks]] usually had one name, but another element was often added in semi-official contexts or to aid identification: a father’s name ([[patronym]]) in the [[genitive case]], or in some regions as an adjectival formulation. A third element might be added, indicating the individual’s membership in a particular kinship or other grouping, or city of origin (when the person in question was away from that city). Thus the orator [[Demosthenes]], while proposing decrees in the [[Athenian assembly]], was known as "Demosthenes, son of Demosthenes of [[Paiania]]"; Paiania was the [[deme]] or regional sub-unit of [[Attica]] to which he belonged by birth. If Americans used that system, [[Abraham Lincoln#Early life and family ancestry|Abraham Lincoln]] would have been called "Abraham, son of Thomas of Kentucky" (where he was born). In some rare occasions, if a person was illegitimate or fathered by a non-citizen, they might use their mother's name (metronym) instead of their father's. Ten days after a birth, relatives on both sides were invited to a sacrifice and feast called ''dekátē'' ({{lang |grc |δεκάτη}}), 'tenth day';  on this occasion the father formally named the child.<ref>N. Dunbar, ''Aristophanes,'' Birds [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=de/katos (1995), 339.]</ref>

Demosthenes was unusual in bearing the same name as his own father; it was more common for names to alternate between generations or between lines of a family. Thus it was common to name a first son after his paternal grandfather, and the second after the maternal grandfather, great-uncle, or great-aunt. A speaker in a Greek court case explained that he had named his four children after, respectively, his own father, the father of his wife, a relative of his wife, and the father of his own mother.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Dem.+43+74&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0078 Speech against Makartatos, ascribed to Demosthenes, sect. 74] (translated by A. T. Murray) ''Perseus Digital Library''</ref>  Alternatively, family members might adopt variants of the same name, as for instance "Demippos, son of Demotimos". The practice of naming children after their grandparents is still widely practiced in Greece today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naming practices|work=Lexicon of Greek Personal Names|publisher=Oxford University|url=http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/names/practices.html|accessdate=16 October 2016}}</ref>

== Naming women ==

In many contexts, etiquette required that respectable women be spoken of as the wife or daughter of X rather than by their own names.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schaps|first=David|date=1977-12-01|title=The Woman Least Mentioned1: Etiquette And Women's Names|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/classical-quarterly/article/div-classtitlethe-woman-least-mentioneda-hreffn01-ref-typefnspan-classsup1spana-etiquette-and-womenandaposs-namesdiv/45AC5C10C4FE81EADD44FC4CF10D13CD|journal=The Classical Quarterly|volume=27|issue=2|pages=323–330|doi=10.1017/S0009838800035606|issn=1471-6844}}</ref> On gravestones or dedications, however, they had to be identified by name. Here, the patronymic formula "son of X" used for men might be replaced by "wife of X", or supplemented as "daughter of X, wife of Y".

Many women bore forms of standard masculine names, with a feminine ending substituted for the masculine. Many standard names related to specific masculine achievements had a common feminine equivalent; the counterpart of ''Nikomachos'', "victorious in battle", would be ''Nikomachē''. The taste mentioned above for giving family members related names was one motive for the creation of such feminine forms. There were also feminine names with no masculine equivalent, such as ''Glykera'' "sweet one"; ''Hedistē'' "most delightful".

Another distinctive way of forming feminine names was the neuter diminutive suffix ''-ion'' (-ιον, while the masculine corresponding suffix was -ιων), suggesting the idea of a "little thing": e.g., ''Aristion'' from ''aristos'' "best"; ''Mikrion'' from ''mikros'' "small". Perhaps by extension of this usage, women’s names were sometimes formed from men’s by a change to a neuter ending without the diminutive sense: ''Hilaron'' from ''hilaros'', "cheerful".

== Formation of names ==

There were five main personal name types in Greece:<ref>[http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/names/LGPN-Ling.html For analysis http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/names/LGPN-Ling.html]</ref>

=== Compound names ===
''Demosthenes'' is compounded from two ordinary Greek roots (a structure at least as old as [[proto-Indo-European]]):<ref name=Pulgram>{{cite journal|last1=Pulgram|first1=Ernst|authorlink1=Ernst Pulgram|title=Indo-European Personal Names|journal=Language|date=July–September 1947|volume=23|issue=3|pages=189–206|jstor=409874|ref=Pulgram|publisher=Linguistic Society of America|location=Washington|doi=10.2307/409874}}</ref> ''demos'' "people" and ''sthenos'' "strength". A vast number of Greek names have this form, being compounded from two clearly recognizable (though sometimes shortened) elements: ''Nikomachos'' from ''nike'' "victory" and ''mache'' "battle", ''Sophokles'' from ''sophos'' "wise, skilled" and ''kleos'' "glory", ''Polykrates'' from ''poly'' "much" and ''kratos'' "power".  The elements used in these compounds are typically positive and of good omen, stressing such ideas as beauty, strength, bravery, victory, glory, and horsemanship. The order of the elements was often reversible: ''aristos'' and ''kleos'' give both ''Aristokles'' and ''Klearistos''. Such compounds have a more or less clear meaning. But as was already noted by Aristotle,<ref>Aristotle, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1457a ''Poetics'' 1457a 12-14] (translated by W. H. Fyfe) ''Perseus Digital Library''</ref> two elements could be brought together in illogical ways. Thus the immensely productive ''hippos'' "horse" yielded, among hundreds of compounds, not only meaningful ones such as ''Philippos'' "lover of horses" and ''Hippodamas'' "horse-tamer", but also ''Xenippos'' "stranger horse" and ''Andrippos'' "man horse".  There were, in turn, numerous other names beginning with ''Xen-'' and ''Andr-''. These "irrational" compounds arose through a combination of common elements.<ref>O. Masson, ''Onomastica Graeca Selecta'', ed. C. Dobias and L. Dubois (1990), 88 and 404.</ref> One motive was a tendency for members of the same family to receive names that echoed one another without being identical. Thus we meet Demippos, son of Demotimos, where the son’s name is irrational ("people horse") and the father’s name meaningful ("people honour", i.e., honored among the people).

=== Shortened names ===
A second major category of names was shortened versions ("[[hypocoristic]]s," or in German ''Kosenamen'') of the compounded names. Thus alongside the many names beginning with ''Kall-'' "beauty" such as ''Kallinikos'' "of fair victory", there are shortened ''Kallias'' and ''Kallon'' (masculine) or ''Kallis'' (feminine). Alongside victory names such as ''Nikostratos'' "victory army", there are ''Nikias'' and ''Nikon'' (masculine) or ''Niko'' (feminine). Such shortenings were variously formed and very numerous: more than 250 shortenings of names in ''Phil(l)-'' ("love") and related roots have been counted.

=== Simple names ===
Ordinary nouns and adjectives of the most diverse types were used as names, either unadjusted or with the addition of a wide variety of suffixes. For instance, some twenty different names are formed from ''aischros'' "ugly", including that of the poet we know as [[Aeschylus]], the Latin spelling of ''Aischylos''. Among the many different categories of nouns and adjectives from which the most common names derive are colors (''Xanthos'' "yellow'), animals (''Moschos'' "heifer", and ''Dorkas'' "roe deer"), physical characteristics (''Simos'' "snub nose"), parts of the body (''Kephalos'', from ''kephale'' "head", and many from various slang terms for genitalia). Few of these simple names are as common as the most common compound names, but they are extraordinarily numerous and varied. Identifying their origins often taxes our knowledge of the outer reaches of Greek vocabulary.<ref>J. Curbera, 'Simple Names in Ionia', in R. Parker (ed.), ''Personal Names in Ancient Anatolia'' (2013), 107-144. {{ISBN|9780197265635}}</ref> Here the quest for dignity seen in the compound names largely disappears. Some, to our ears, sound positively disrespectful: ''Gastron'' "pot belly", ''Batrachos'' "frog", ''Kopreus'' "shitty", but these are probably by origin affectionate nicknames, in many cases applied to small children, and subsequently carried on within families.

=== Theophoric ("god-carrying") names ===
Very many Greeks bore names derived from those of gods. Though it was not normal before the Roman period for Greeks to bear exactly the same names as gods, the two most common Greek names (''Dionysios'' and ''Demetrios''; feminine ''Dionysia'' and ''Demetria'') were simple adjectival formations from the divine names ''Dionysos'' and ''Demeter''. There were also compound theophoric names, formed with a wide variety of suffixes, of which the most common were ''-doros'' "gift of" (e.g. ''Dionysodoros'' "gift of Dionysos") or ''-dotos'' "given by" (''Apollodotos''). Many names were also based on cult titles of gods: ''Pythodoros'', from ''Pythios'' "Apollo".  Also common were names formed from the simple ''theos'' "god", such as ''Theodotos/Theodora''. All the major gods except the god of war, ''Ares'', and gods associated with the underworld (''Persephone, Hades, Plouton'' [=&nbsp;Latin ''Pluto'']) generated theophoric names, as did some lesser gods (rivers in particular) and heroes. When new gods rose to prominence (''Asklepios'') or entered Greece from outside (''Isis, Sarapis''), they too generated theophoric names formed in the normal ways (e.g. ''Asklepiodotos, Isidoros, Sarapias'').<ref>R. Parker, [http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/proc/files/104p053.pdf 'Theophoric Names and the History of Greek Religion'], in S. Hornblower and E. Matthews (eds.), [http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/proc/volumes/pba104.html ''Greek Personal Names. Their Value as Evidence''] (2000) ''Proceedings of the British Academy'', Volume 104, pp. 53-80</ref>

=== Lallnamen ===
This is the German word used for names that derived not from other words but from the sounds made by little children addressing their relatives. Typically, they involve repeated consonants or syllables (like English ''Dada, Nana'')—examples are ''Nanna'' and ''Papas''. They grew hugely in frequency from a low base in the Roman period, probably through the influence of other naming traditions such as [[Phrygia]]n, in which such names were very common.

== A brief history of Greek naming ==

The main broad characteristics of Greek name formation listed above are found in other [[Indo-European languages]] (the Indo-Iranian, Germanic, Celtic, Baltic, and Slavic subgroups); they look like an ancient inheritance within Greek.<ref>R. Schmitt, 'Morphologie der Namen: Vollnamen und Kurznamen bzw Kosenamen im Indogermanischen' and 'Entwicklung der Namen in älteren indogermanischen Sprachen', in E. Eichler and others, ''Namenforschung'', vol. I (1995), 419-427 and 616-636.</ref> The naming practices of the Mycenaeans in the 14th/13th centuries BC, insofar as they can be reconstructed from the early Greek known as [[Linear B]], seem already to display most of the characteristics of the system visible when literacy resumed in the 8th century BC, though non-Greek names were also present. This is true also of the epic poetry of Homer, where many heroes have compound names of familiar types (''Alexandros, Alkinoos, Amphimakhos''). But the names of several of the greatest heroes (e.g. ''Achilleus, Odysseus, Agamemnon, Priamos'') cannot be interpreted in those terms and were seldom borne by mortals again until a taste for "heroic" names developed under the Roman empire; they have a different, unexplained origin. The system described above underwent few changes before the Roman period, though the rise of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] to power earned names of that region such as ''Ptolemaios, Berenike'', and ''Arsinoe'' new popularity. Alternative names ("X also known as Y") started to appear in documents in the 2nd century BC but had been occasionally mentioned in literary sources much earlier.

A different phenomenon, that of individuals bearing two names (e.g., ''Hermogenes Theodotos''), emerged among families of high social standing—particularly in Asia Minor in the Roman imperial period, possibly under the influence of Roman naming patterns. The influence of Rome is certainly visible both in the adoption of Roman names by Greeks and in the drastic transformation of names by Greeks who acquired [[Roman citizenship]], a status marked by possession of not one but [[Roman naming conventions|three names]]. Such Greeks often took the ''[[praenomen]]'' and ''[[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|nomen]]'' of the authors or sponsors of their citizenship, but retained their Greek name as ''[[cognomen]]'' to give such forms as Titus Flavius Alkibiades. Various mixed forms also emerged. The Latin suffix ''–ianus'', originally indicating the birth family of a Roman adopted into another family, was taken over to mean initially "son of" (e.g. ''Asklepiodotianos'' = son of Asklepiodotos), then later as a source of independent new names.

Another impulse came with the spread of Christianity, which brought new popularity to names from the New Testament, names of saints and martyrs, and existing Greek names such as ''Theodosios'' "gift of god", which could be reinterpreted in Christian terms. But non-Christian names, even theophoric names such as ''Dionysios'' or ''Sarapion'', continued to be borne by Christians — a reminder that a theophoric name could become a name like any other, its original meaning forgotten. Another phenomenon of late antiquity (5th–6th centuries) was a gradual shift away from the use of the father’s name in the genitive as an identifier. A tendency emerged instead to indicate a person’s profession or status within the Christian church: carpenter, deacon, etc.<ref>R. Parker, 'Introduction. New trends in Greek naming', in R. Parker (ed.), ''Personal Names in Ancient Anatolia'' (2013), 11-14, for all the developments in this paragraph.</ref>  Many Greek names have come down by various routes into modern English, some easily recognisable such as Helen or Alexander, some modified such as Denis (from Dionysios).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/announcements/GreekNamesinEnglish.html|title=Greek Names in English|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

==Suffixes==
Many Greeks names used distinctive suffixes that conveyed additional meaning.  The suffix ''-ides'' (''idas'' in Doric areas such as Sparta) indicates patrilineal descent, e.g. ''Leonidas'' ("son of the lion").  The diminutive suffix ''-ion'' was also common, e.g. ''Hephaestion'' ("little Hephaestus").<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MINON|first=Sophie|title=Programme colloque Suffixation anthroponymique grecque Lyon Septembre 2015|url=https://www.academia.edu/15478859/Programme_colloque_Suffixation_anthroponymique_grecque_Lyon_Septembre_2015|language=en}}</ref>

== Names as history ==

The French [[epigraphist]] [[Louis Robert (historian)|Louis Robert]] declared that what is needed in the study of names is not "catalogues of names but the history of names and even history by means of names (l'histoire par les noms)."<ref>L. Robert, ''Opera Minora Selecta'', 2 (1970), 987.</ref> Names are a neglected but in some areas crucial historical source.<ref>R. Parker, 'Introduction', in R. Parker (ed.) ''Personal Names in Ancient Anatolia'' (2013), 1-10. {{ISBN|9780197265635}}</ref> Many names are characteristic of particular cities or regions. It is seldom safe to use an individual’s name to assign him to a particular place, as the factors that determine individual choices of name are very various.  But where a good cluster of names are present, it will usually be possible to identify with much plausibility where the group in question derives from. By such means, the origins of, say, bands of mercenaries or groups of colonists named in inscriptions without indication of their homeland can often be determined. Names are particularly important in situations of cultural contact: they may answer the question whether a particular city is Greek or non-Greek, and document the shifts and complexities in ethnic self-identification even within individual families. They also, through theophoric names, provide crucial evidence for the diffusion of new cults, and later of Christianity.

Two other once-popular ways of exploiting names for social history, by contrast, have fallen out of favor. Certain names and classes of name were often borne by slaves, since their names were given or changed at will by their owners, who may not have liked to allow them dignified names.<ref>Plato, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172%3Atext%3DCrat.%3Asection%3D384d ''Cratylus'', section 384d] (translated by Harold N. Fowler) ''Perseus Digital Library''</ref> But no names or very few were so borne exclusively, and many slaves had names indistinguishable from those of the free; one can never identify a slave by name alone.<ref>E. Matthews, article 'Names, Personal, Greek', in S. Hornblower and A. Spawforth (eds), ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' ed. 4 (2012), 996. {{ISBN|9780199545568}}</ref>  Similar arguments apply to so-called "[[courtesan]]s’ names".
