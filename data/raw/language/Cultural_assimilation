}}'''Cultural assimilation''' is the process in which a [[minority group]] or [[culture]] comes to resemble those of a dominant group.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Boyer |first1=P |title=Cultural Assimilation |journal=International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences |date=2001 |pages=3032–3035 |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/00364-8|isbn=9780080430768 }}</ref>  The term is used to refer to both individuals and groups; the latter case can refer to a range of social groups, including [[ethnic minorities]], [[immigrants]], [[indigenous peoples]], and other marginalized groups such as [[sexual minorities]] who adapt to being culturally dominated by another societal group.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Cultural assimilation may involve either a quick or a gradual change depending on circumstances of the group. Full assimilation occurs when members of a society become indistinguishable from those of the dominant group. 

Whether it is desirable for a given group to assimilate is often disputed by both members of the group and those of the dominant society. Cultural assimilation does not guarantee social alikeness. Geographical and other natural barriers between cultures, even if created by the dominant culture, may be culturally different.<ref>Parisi, Domenico, Federico Cecconi, and Francesco Natale. "Cultural change in spatial environments: the role of cultural assimilation and internal changes in cultures." ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' 47.2 (2003): 163–179.</ref>

== Overview ==
A place, state, or ethnicity can spontaneously adopt a different culture because of its political relevance or its perceived cultural superiority. An example is the [[Latin]] language and [[Roman culture]] being gradually adopted by most of the people subjugated by [[Ancient Rome]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Cultural assimilation can happen either spontaneously or forcibly (''see [[forced assimilation]]''). A culture can spontaneously adopt a different culture. Also, older, richer, or otherwise more dominant cultures can forcibly absorb subordinate cultures.

The term “assimilation” is often used with regard to not only indigenous groups but also immigrants settled in a new land. A new culture and new attitudes toward the origin culture are obtained through contact and communication. Assimilation assumes that a relatively-tenuous culture gets to be united to one unified culture. That process happens by contact and accommodation between each culture. The current definition of assimilation is usually used to refer to immigrants, but in [[multiculturalism]], cultural assimilation can happen all over the world and within varying social contexts and is not limited to specific areas. For example, a shared language gives people the chance to study and work internationally, without being limited to the same cultural group. People from different countries contribute to diversity and form the "global culture" which means the culture combined by the elements from different countries. That "global culture" can be seen as a part of assimilation, which causes cultures from different areas to affect one another.

== Indigenous assimilation ==
=== Canada 1800s-1900s - Forced assimilation of Aboriginals ===
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Canadian government began a campaign to forcibly assimilate [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Aboriginals]]. The government consolidated power over Aboriginal land through unfair treaties and the use of force, eventually isolating indigenous people to reserves. Marriage practices and spiritual ceremonies were banned, and spiritual leaders were imprisoned. Additionally, the Canadian government instituted an extensive residential school system to assimilate children. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada concluded that this effort was violent enough to amount to [[cultural genocide]]. The schools actively worked to alienate children from their cultural roots. Students were prohibited from speaking their native languages, were regularly abused, and were arranged marriages by the government after their graduation. The explicit goal of the Canadian government was to completely assimilate the Aboriginals into European culture and destroy all traces of their native history. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.myrobust.com/websites/trcinstitution/File/Reports/Executive_Summary_English_Web.pdf|title=Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626204608/http://www.myrobust.com/websites/trcinstitution/File/Reports/Executive_Summary_English_Web.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

=== Brazil ===
In January 2019, newly elected [[Brazil]]'s president [[Jair Bolsonaro]] has stripped the indigenous affairs agency [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|FUNAI]] of the responsibility to identify and demarcate [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous lands]]. He argued that those territories have very tiny isolated populations and proposed to integrate them into the larger Brazilian society.<ref>{{cite news |title=Brazil’s new president makes it harder to define indigenous lands |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4808295/jair-bolsonaro-funai-indigenous-farm-brazil/ |work=Global News |date=January 2, 2019}}</ref> According to the [[Survival International]], "Taking responsibility for indigenous land demarcation away from FUNAI, the Indian affairs department, and giving it to the Agriculture Ministry is virtually a declaration of open warfare against [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Brazil’s tribal peoples]]."<ref>{{cite news |title=President Bolsonaro 'declares war' on Brazil's indigenous peoples - Survival responds |url=https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/12060 |publisher=[[Survival International]] |date=January 3, 2019}}</ref>

== Immigrant assimilation ==
Immigrant assimilation is a complex process in which immigrants not only fully integrate themselves into a new country but also lose aspects, perhaps even all of their heritage. Social scientists rely on four primary benchmarks to assess immigrant assimilation: [[socioeconomic status]], geographic distribution, [[second language]] attainment, and [[exogamy|intermarriage]].<ref name="Waters" />  William A.V. Clark defines immigrant assimilation as "a way of understanding the social dynamics of American society and that it is the process that occurs spontaneously and often unintended in the course of interaction between majority and [[minority groups]]."<ref name="Clark">{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=W. |year=2003 |title=Immigrants and the American Dream: Remaking the Middle Class |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-880-0 }}</ref>

=== United States===
{{Further|Americanization (immigration)}}
[[File:California State Senator Ted Lieu (14023404919).jpg|thumb|Taiwan-born U.S. politician [[Ted Lieu]]]]
Between 1880 and 1920, the United States took in roughly 24 million [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]].<ref name="Waters">{{Cite journal |last=Waters |first=Mary C. |last2=Jiménez |first2=Tomás R. |title=Assessing Immigrant Assimilation: New Empirical and Theoretical Challenges |journal=[[Annual Review of Sociology]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=105–125 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100026 |url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3203280 }}</ref>  This increase in immigration can be attributed to many historical changes. The beginning of the 21st century has also marked a massive era of immigration, and sociologists are once again trying to make sense of the impacts that immigration has on society and on the on immigrants themselves.<ref name="Waters"/>

Assimilation had various meanings in American sociology. [[Henry Pratt Fairchild]] associates American assimilation with Americanization or the ''[[melting pot]]'' theory. Some scholars also believed that assimilation and acculturation were synonymous. According to a common point of view, assimilation is a "process of interpretation and fusion" from another group or person. That may include memories, behaviors and sentiments. By sharing their experiences and histories, they blend into the common cultural life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/ecology-and-environmentalism/environmental-studies/assimilation|title=Assimilation facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Assimilation|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-11-11}}</ref>

The long history of immigration in the established gateways means that the place of immigrants in terms of [[social class|class]], [[race (classification of human beings)|racial]], and [[ethnic]] hierarchies in the traditional gateways is more structured or established, but on the other hand, the new gateways do not have much immigration [[history]] and so the place of immigrants in terms of class, racial, and ethnic hierarchies is less defined, and immigrants may have more influence to define their position. Secondly, the size of new gateways may influence immigrant assimilation. Having a smaller gateway may influence the level of [[racial segregation]] among immigrants and native-born people. Thirdly, the difference in institutional arrangements may influence immigrant assimilation. Traditional gateways, unlike new gateways, have many institutions set up to help immigrants such as legal aid, bureaus, social organizations. Finally, Waters and Jimenez have only speculated that those differences may influence immigrant assimilation and the way researchers that should assess immigrant assimilation.<ref name="Waters"/>

=== Canada ===
Canada's multicultural history dates back to its European colonization in the 16th century, when French settlers, British settlers, and indigenous peoples vied for control of the region. <ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/building-mosaic-evolution-canadas-approach-immigrant-integration|title=Building a Mosaic: The Evolution of Canada’s Approach to Immigrant Integration|last=Griffith|first=Andrew|date=2017-10-31|website=migrationpolicy.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>

==== 1900s-present - Integration ====
Canada retains one of the largest [[Immigration to Canada|immigrant populations]] in the world. The 2016 census recorded 7.5 million documented immigrants, representing a fifth of the country's total population <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2017028-eng.htm|title=Immigrant population in Canada, 2016 Census of Population|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2017-10-25|website=www150.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>. Focus has shifted from a rhetoric of cultural assimilation to cultural integration. In contrast to assimilation, integration aims to preserve the roots of a minority society while still allowing for smooth coexistence with the dominant culture. <ref name=":0" />
