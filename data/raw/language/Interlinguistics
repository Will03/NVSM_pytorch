'''Interlinguistics''' as the science of planned languages, exists for more than a century as a specific branch of linguistics<ref>Federico Gobbo, [http://aclc.uva.nl/content/events/lectures/2015/03/27-aclc-seminar-prof-dr-federico-gobbo.html Interlinguistics and Esperanto Studies in the new millennium], University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Center for Language and Communication, 27th March 2015.</ref> for the study of various aspects of linguistic communication. Interlinguistics is a discipline formalized by [[Otto Jespersen]] in [[1931]] as the science of ''interlanguages'', i.e. contact languages tailored for international communication. In more recent times, the object of study of interlinguistics was put into relation with [[language planning]], the collection of strategies to deliberately influence the structure and function of a living language. In this framework, interlanguages become a subset of planned languages, i.e. extreme cases of language planning<ref>Federico Gobbo, [http://aihr.uva.nl/content/events/lectures/201/03/24-aclc-seminar-ma-lezing-gobbo.html Interlinguistics in the 21st century: planned languages as a tool to learn linguistics by doing], University of Amsterdam, 24th March 2017.</ref>.  

Interlinguistics first appeared as a branch of studies devoted to the establishment of norms for auxiliary languages, but over it's century long history it has been understood by different authors more and more broadly as an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] branch of science which includes various aspects of communication, [[language planning]] and [[Standardization (linguistics)|standardization]], [[Multilingualism and globalization|multilingualism and globalisation]], [[language policy]], [[translation]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[Intercultural communication principles|intercultural communication,]] the history of [[Language creation in artificial intelligence|language creation]] and literature written in [[planned languages]] (international auxiliary languages (auxlangs) as well as constructed languages : conlangs), fictional artistic languages (artlangs), [[Lingua franca|lingua francas]], [[Pidgin|pidgins]], [[Creole language|creoles]] and [[Constructed language|constructed languages]] in the internet and other topics were added<ref>Věra Barandovská-Frank, ''[http://interl.amu.edu.pl/interlingvistiko/Int%20Simp%20Resumoj%2017.pdf The Concept of Interlinguistics as an object of study]'', 4th Interlinguistic Symposium 21-22.09.2017, [http://interl.amu.edu.pl/interlingvistiko/studojen.html Adam Mickiewicz University], [[Poznań|Poznan]], Poland</ref>.   

== Etymology and history ==
The term was first coined in French (Interlinguistique) by the Belgian [[Esperantist]] [[Jules Meysmans]].<ref>(eo) «Biografio de Jules Meysmans », ''Informilo por interlingvistoj'', 2015, <abbr>p.</abbr> 14 (ISSN 1385-2191, online ([http://esperantic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IpI-92-93-_1-2-2015_.pdf PDF]) <small>[http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fesperantic.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FIpI-92-93-_1-2-2015_.pdf archive]</small>)</ref>

The main historical periods of Interlinguistics are :

first, the pioneer era (1879 - 1911), when its basis was put forth; 

secondly, the foundational era (1911 - 1951), when the interlinguistics wars took place to decide the most appropriate form of an auxiliary language; 

thirdly, the school era (1951-1990), when independent Interlinguistics schools formed in different countries, mainly Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland, each with particular attention to [[Esperanto]]; 

lastly, the current era of [[language policy]] (1990 - today), during which interlinguistics is more tightly integrated with other disciplines, mainly linguistics and various social and political sciences, particularly via the topics of [[globalism]], [[linguistic justice]], management of [[multilingualism]], and new forms of mobility.<ref>Federico Gobbo, ''Interlinguistics in the 21st century: new opportunities, new challenges'', in : [http://www.esperantic.org/en/publications/ifi-information-for-interlinguists/ Information for Interlinguists], vol. 2, no. 5 (3/2018), p. 9 | ISSN 2521-7461 ([http://www.esperantic.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IfI_105_final.pdf PDF])</ref>   

At the Institute of Linguistics of AMU there is the extramural Interlinguistic studies program. Over the course of three years these studies provide the students with a basic knowledge of general linguistics, interlinguistics, international and [[intercultural communication]] with a focus on the linguistics, culture and movement of the internationally dispersed and naturally functioning planned language [[Esperanto]]. Every third year the Interlinguistic Studies program also organizes an international interlinguistic symposium<ref>Ilona Koutny, Interlinguistic Symposium, p. 212, JKI-12-2017[1] ([http://jki.amu.edu.pl/files/JKI-12-2017&#x5B;1&#x5D;.pdf pdf]).</ref>. 

At the University of Amsterdam there is also a chair Esperanto and interlinguistics at the University of Amsterdam. 

== Field of studies ==
The field of interlinguistics is concerned with [[International auxiliary language|international planned languages]] <ref>Planned languages are created by an intentional intellectual effort, usually with the aim of facilitating interlinguistic communication, but there are also interlanguages that have arisen spontaneously. These are called ''[[Pidgin|pidgin languages]]''. </ref> [also called ‘constructed languages‘, ‘auxiliary languages‘, or ‘artificial languages‘] as [[Esperanto]], and with the relationship between planned languages<ref>The phenomenon of planned languages offers important insights into general linguistics and into planning language use at the international level.</ref> and [[language planning]]. Increasingly, undergraduate courses in planned languages are expanding to embrace not only the history of languages planned for international use, but also the field of imaginary and fictional languages<ref>Yevgeniya Amis, [https://www.esperantic.org/en/2018/09/04/esf-convenes-symposium-on-esperanto-and-interlinguistics/ ESF convenes symposium on Esperanto and Interlinguistics], Esperantic Studies Foundation, </ref>. Interlinguistics is also concerned with investigating how ethnic and [[International auxiliary language|international planned languages]] work as [[lingua franca]] and with the possibilities of optimizing interlinguistic communication. 

The term ''Interlinguistics'' can be interpreted in at least two ways: 

# Study of  ''interlinguae'', i.e., of interlanguages that serve for interlinguistic communication - not to be confused with the [[interlanguage|interim language]]s of language learners, which also came to be called ”interlanguages” by some authors.
# Study of phenomena that can be observed ''inter linguae'' 'between languages'.
Among these interpretations, the first one is by far the most well established, while [[Mario Wandruszka]] had only the second one in mind.<ref>Mario Wandruszka: ''Interlinguistik: Umrisse einer neuen Sprachwissenschaft.'' (’Interlinguistics: Contours of a New Linguistic Discipline’) Piper Verlag, 1982, {{ISBN|3-492-00314-1}}</ref>

The term appears first to have been used in French (''interlinguistique'') by Jules Meysmans in 1911 in a text concerning [[international auxiliary language]]s.<ref name=":0">Jules Meysmans (1911-12): Une science nouvelle. In: ''Lingua Internationale'' (Bruxelles). 1, Nr. 8, 14-16.</ref> It became more widely accepted subsequent to an address by the Danish linguist [[Otto Jespersen]] to the 2nd International Congress of Linguists in 1931. According to Jespersen, interlinguistics is ”that branch of the science of language which deals with the structure and basic ideas of all languages with the view to the establishing of a norm for interlanguages, ''i.e.'' auxiliary languages destined for oral and written use between people who cannot make themselves understood by means of their mother tongues”.<ref>Herbert N. Shenton, Edward Sapir, Otto Jespersen (eds.): ''International Communication: A Symposium on the Language Problem.'' Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., London 1931.</ref> According to this definition, investigations that are useful for optimizing interlinguistic communication are central to the discipline, and the purpose may be to develop a new language intended for international use or for use within a multilingual country or union. Research of this kind has been undertaken by the International Delegation, which developed [[Ido (language)|Ido]] (1907), and by the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] (IALA), which developed [[Interlingua]] (1951).

[[Valter Tauli]] considered interlinguistics as a subdiscipline of [[language planning]].<ref>Valter Tauli (1968): ''Introduction to a theory of language planning''. Uppsala: Almquist & Wiksells, S. 167.</ref> The principles recommended by him for [[language planning]] applied to the guided development of national languages are also, and more liberally so, applicable to constructed interlanguages. It is noteworthy that these principles have close counterparts among Grice’s [[conversational maxims]]. These maxims describe how effective communication in conversation is achieved, and in order to function well, a language must be such that it allows respecting these maxims, which languages not always do.<ref>Hartmut Traunmüller: [http://www2.ling.su.se/staff/hartmut/griceil.htm Conversational Maxims and Principles of Language Planning] ''PERILUS XII'', pp 25-47, Department of Linguistics, Stockholm University, 1991.</ref>

Most publications in the field of interlinguistics are, however, not so constructive, but rather [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive]], [[comparative linguistics|comparative]], historic, [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]], or concerned with [[translation]] by humans or machines. As for [[Esperanto]], which is the most widely used constructed interlanguage, there is a relatively abundant literature about the language itself and its [[philology]] (see [[Esperantology]]).

Only a few of the many constructed languages have been applied practically to any noteworthy extent. The most prosperous were [[Volapük]] (1879, [[Johann Martin Schleyer]]), [[Esperanto]] (1887 [[Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof]]), [[Latino sine flexione]] (1903, [[Giuseppe Peano]]), [[Ido (language)|Ido]] (1907, [[Louis Couturat]]), [[Interlingue|Occidental]]-Interlingue (1922, [[Edgar de Wahl]]) and [[Interlingua]] (1951, IALA and [[Alexander Gode]]), with Esperanto being the only one still gathering a considerable community of active speakers today. Here, the [[Bliss symbols]] (1949, [[Charles K. Bliss]])<ref>Charles K. Bliss: ''International semantography: a non-alphabetical symbol writing readable in all languages'' Institute of Semantography, Sidney 1949</ref> deserve also to be mentioned. These were intended for international communication, but have found their field of application elsewhere, namely as an aid for persons who lack an adequate ability of using ordinary language, because of motorical or cognitive handicaps.

Among constructed languages, it is usual to distinguish between ''a priori languages'' and ''a posteri languages''. The latter are based on one or, more often, several source languages, while this is not evident for a priori languages, e.g., the [[philosophical language]]s of the 17th century, [[Solresol]] and the [[logical language]]s of the 20th century, such as [[Loglan]] and [[Lojban]].  Spontaneously arisen Interlanguages are necessarily a posteriori or iconic (using imaging or imitating signs).
