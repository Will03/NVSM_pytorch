The '''[[Chinese language|Chinese]] word for "[[crisis]]"''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|危机}}|t={{linktext|危機}}|p=wēijī}}) is frequently invoked in Western motivational speaking as being composed of two [[Chinese characters]] respectively signifying "danger" and "opportunity". While the original meaning of ''wēijī'' is "danger at a point of juncture," and many linguists and native Chinese speakers highlight the errors in its Western reinterpretation, the term's "danger-plus-opportunity" meaning has been so widely used by politicians, businesspeople, and in popular culture that its alternative etymology has been picked up all over the world, including by some native Chinese speakers.

==Usage==
[[United States|American]] [[linguist]] [[Benjamin Zimmer]] has traced mentions in English of the Chinese term for "crisis" as far as an anonymous editorial in a 1938 journal for missionaries in China.<ref>''Chinese Recorder'' (January 1938, "The Challenge of Unusual Times")</ref><ref name="langlog">{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004343.html |date=27 March 2007 |work=[[Language Log]] |title=Crisis = danger + opportunity: The plot thickens |last=Zimmer |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Zimmer |accessdate=19 January 2009}}</ref> But its use probably gained momentum in the [[United States]] after [[John F. Kennedy]] employed this [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]] in [[John F. Kennedy 1960 presidential campaign|campaign speeches]] in 1959 and 1960:<ref name="langlog"/>
<blockquote>In the Chinese language, the word "crisis" is composed of two characters,<br/>
one representing danger and the other, opportunity.<ref>[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/Ready-Reference/JFK-Quotations.aspx#C Speeches] by President Kennedy at [[United Negro College Fund]] fundraiser, Indianapolis, Indiana, 12 April 1959, and Valley Forge Country Club, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, 29 October 1960</ref></blockquote>

Referencing the word has since become a staple [[meme]] for American business consultants and motivational speakers, as well as gaining popularity in educational institutions, politics and in the popular press. For example, in 2007, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] applied it during [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|Middle East peace talks]].<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/18/AR2007011801881.html |title=Rice Highlights Opportunities After Setbacks On Mideast Trip |first=Glenn |last=Kessler |date=2007-01-19 |page=A14 |accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref> Former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] did so both in testimony before the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] [[Energy and Commerce Committee]], in the introduction of ''[[An Inconvenient Truth (book)|An Inconvenient Truth]]'', and in his [[Nobel Peace Prize]] acceptance lecture.<ref>https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/hearings/032107_gore.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/gore-lecture_en.html |title=Al Gore: The Nobel Peace Prize 2007: Nobel Lecture |location=[[Oslo]] |first=Al |last=Gore |authorlink=Al Gore |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |date=2007-12-10 |accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref>

Benjamin Zimmer attributes the appeal of this anecdote to its "handiness" as a rhetorical device and optimistic "call to action",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004330.html |work=[[Language Log]] |accessdate=19 January 2009 |date=22 March 2007 |title=Stop Him Before He Tropes Again |last=Zimmer |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Zimmer}}</ref> as well as to "[[wishful thinking]]".<ref name="mair"/>

==Popular mistranslation==

The primary meaning of the second character in ''wēijī'', pronounced ''jī'', ({{zh|s=[[:wikt:机|机]]|t=[[:wikt:機|機]]}}) is not "opportunity".<ref name="langlog"/><ref>[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2363/is-the-chinese-word-for-crisis-a-combination-of-danger-and-opportunity "The Straight Dope: Is the Chinese word for "crisis" a combination of "danger" and "opportunity"?"]</ref> [[Sinologist]] [[Victor H. Mair]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] states the popular interpretation of {{zh|p=wēijī|c=|labels=no}} as "danger" plus "opportunity" is a "widespread public misperception" in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world.<ref name="mair"/> While the character {{Zh|t={{linktext|危}}|p=wēi|labels=no}} does indeed mean "dangerous" or "precarious", the character {{Zh|t={{linktext|機}}|p=jī|labels=no}} is highly [[polysemous]] and does not, in isolation, translate as "opportunity".<ref name="mair">{{cite web | url=http://pinyin.info/chinese/crisis.html | title=danger + opportunity ≠ crisis: How a misunderstanding about Chinese characters has led many astray | last=Mair | first=Victor H. | authorlink=Victor H. Mair | publisher=PinyinInfo.com | year=2005 | accessdate=15 January 2009}}</ref> The confusion likely arises from the fact that {{Zh|t=機|labels=no|p=jī}} is a component of the Chinese word for "opportunity" {{zh|p=jīhuì|c=|labels=no}} ({{Zh|c=|s={{linktext|机会}}|t={{linktext|機會}}|first=t|labels=no}}, literally "meeting a critical point").

According to the 10th Edition of ''[[Xinhua Zidian]]'', the best-selling Chinese dictionary, the character {{Zh|c=|s=|t=機|labels=no|p=jī}} in {{Zh|c={{linktext|危機}}|s=|t=|p=wēijī|labels=no}} means "a point where things happen or change", this meaning appears to be neutral, from which derive two other meanings: "an event that has a confidential nature", and "chance (opportunity), good timing" which appears to be a positive one.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Xinhua Zidian]]|date=2004|publisher=Commercial Press|location=Beijing|isbn=7-100-02893-0|page=205|edition=10th revised, large-print|url=|ref=xhzd|language=Chinese|quote=❶事物发生、变化的枢纽：生～.危～.转～.(引)1.对事情成败有保密性质的事件：军～.～密.～要.2.机会，合宜的时候：随～应变.勿失良～.好时～.[...].

== Use by native Chinese-speakers ==
However, even Chinese itself contains the expression "turn danger into opportunity" ({{Zh|c={{linktext|化危为机}}|s=|t=|p=huà wēi wéi jī|labels=no}}) using these exact two characters. It's possible this is a back translation from English, but either way it's not clear that this popular expression is truly a "mistranslation."{{or|date=January 2019}}

On February 1, 2017, Chinese-American professor [[Shoucheng Zhang]] of Stanford University, a specialist in [[condensed matter physics]] and [[Topological insulator|topological insulators]], invoked the word, claiming it combines "crisis" with opportunity. He claimed that the information technology industry is heading towards a crisis and an opportunity as [[Moore's law]] seems to become harder to sustain; and used this as a motivation for the opportunity of [[Topological quantum computer|topological quantum computing]] in his special lecture.<ref name=":0">{{Cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCQ7CAQ4Npc|title=Electron Superhighway: A Quantum Leap for Computing {{!}} 1 of 2|last=Zhang|first=Shoucheng|date=February 1, 2017|language=en-US|type=Video|publisher=Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics|place=[[Stanford, California]]|author-link=Shoucheng Zhang}}</ref> Zhang claimed (at 14:48 in the video) that, whereas the word "crisis" in western cultures carries only negative connotations, in "our [Chinese] ancient culture, it's already recognized." He then stated that the limited viability of Moore's law is a crisis which also presents an opportunity for Silicon Valley to reinvent itself through [[quantum computing]].<ref name=":0" />
