'''The Father Tongue hypothesis''' proposes that humans tend to speak their father's language. It is based on the discovery, in 1997, of a closer correlation between language and [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosomal variation]] than between language and [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial DNA variation]]. The initial work was performed on African and European samples by a team of population geneticists led by Laurent Excoffier.<ref name="Poloni et al 1997">{{cite journal |last1=Poloni |first1=Estela S |author2=Semino O, Passarino G, Santachiara-Benerecetti AS, Dupanloup I, Langaney A, Excoffier L|title=Human genetic affinities for Y-chromosome p49a,f/TaqI haplotypes show strong correspondence with linguistics|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|year=1997|volume=61|pages=1015–1035 |pmid=9346874 |doi=10.1086/301602 |issue=5 |pmc=1716025}}</ref><ref name="Barbujani 1997">{{cite journal|last=Barbujani|first=Guido|title=Invited Editorial: DNA Variation and Language Affinities|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|year=1997|volume=61|pages=1011–1014|doi=10.1086/301620}}</ref> On the basis of these and similar findings by other geneticists, the hypothesis was elaborated by historical linguist [[George van Driem]] in 2010 that the teaching by a mother of her spouse's tongue to her children is a mechanism by which language has preferentially been spread over time.<ref name="van Driem 2010">{{cite book |last1=van Driem |first1=George |title=Austroasiatic Linguistics: Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Austroasiatic Linguistics, 26-28 November 2007 |year=2010 |publisher=Central Institute of Indian Languages |location=Mysore |pages=224–259 |editor=Keralaputra Shreevinasaiah Nagaraja and Kashyap Mankodi |chapter=The Shompen of Great Nicobar Island: New linguistic and genetic data, and the Austroasiatic homeland revisited|url=https://www.academia.edu/download/36272178/ShompenMTXIII.pdf}}</ref>

==Origin of the hypothesis==
The Y chromosome follows [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] inheritance, meaning it is only passed on among males, from father to son. Mitochondrial DNA on the other hand follows [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] inheritance, meaning it is only passed on from the mother to her children and from her daughters to their children. In 1997 Laurent Excoffier, his student Estella Poloni and his team reported that they had found a strong correlation between the Y-chromosomal sequence P49a,f/Taql variation and linguistics, while not being able to find such a correspondence for the mtDNA variation. Poloni et al. proposed the possible consequences of such a correlation, i.e. the Father Tongue hypothesis:

:"As a consequence, the female-specific diversity of our genome would fit less well with geography and linguistics than would our male-specific component. [...] If that were to prove to be the case, then the common belief that we speak our mother's tongue should be revised in favor of the concept of a ‘father's tongue’."<ref name="Poloni et al 1997"/>

Estella Poloni also presented the Father Tongue hypothesis at an international conference in Paris in April 2000.<ref name="Poloni et al 2000">{{cite book |last1=Poloni |first1=Estella Simone |title=Proceedings: Evolution of Language, 3rd International Conference 3-6 April 2000 |year=2000 |publisher=École Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications |location=Paris |pages=185–186 |editor=Jean-Louis Dessalles and Laleh Ghadakpour |chapter=Languages and genes: Modes of transmission observed through the analysis of male-specific and female-specific genes|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

On the basis of this population genetic work, historical linguist George van Driem elaborated the Father Tongue hypothesis in his ethnolinguistic publications and in population genetic publications which he has co-authored.<ref name="van Driem 2007">{{cite journal|last=van Driem|first=George|title=Austroasiatic phylogeny and the Austroasiatic homeland in light of recent population genetic studies|journal=Mon-Khmer Studies|year=2007|volume=37|pages=1–14}}</ref> At the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association conference in Taipei in 2002 he proposed that

:"a mother teaching her children their father’s tongue has been a recurrent, ubiquitous and prevalent pattern throughout linguistic history, […] some of the mechanisms of language change over time are likely to be inherent to the dynamics of this pathway of transmission. Such correlations are observed worldwide."<ref name="van Driem 2012a">{{cite journal|last=van Driem|first=George|title=The ethnolinguistic identity of the domesticators of Asian rice|journal=Comptes Rendus Palevol|year=2012|volume=11|issue=2|pages=117–132|doi=10.1016/j.crpv.2011.07.004}}</ref>

These language-specific Y-chromosomal markers create correlations such as those observed by Poloni et al. 1997, and furthermore allow the geographic extent, the time depth and the male immigration level underlying an unrecorded (prehistoric) language change to be determined. Thus, as little as 10–20% of prehistoric male immigration can (but need not) cause a language switch, indicating an élite imposition such as may have happened with the appearance of the first farmers or metalworkers in the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages.<ref name="Forster and Renfrew 2011"/>

==Examples of father tongues==
There are several salient examples where the prehistoric diffusion of a language family correlates strongly with the diffusion of Y-chromosomal haplogroups.<ref name="Forster and Renfrew 2011"/>

*The dispersal of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] from a proposed homeland in the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] is suggested to be linked to the spread of the [[Haplogroup R-M207|R haplogroup]] subclade, R1a1, into Europe.<ref name="Zerjal 1999">{{cite book |last1=Zerjal |first1=Tatiana|author2=Pandya A, Santos FR, Adhikari R, Tarazona E, Kayser M, Evgrafov O, Singh L, Thangaraj K, Destro-Bisol G, Thomas MG, Qamar R, Mehdi SQ, Rosser ZH, Hurles ME, Jobling MA, Tyler-Smith C|title=Genomic Diversity.

*[[Austroasiatic]] speakers show a high frequency of the [[Haplogroup O-M175|O2a haplogroup subclade]]. For example, [[Munda languages|Munda]] speakers in north and northeast India show high frequencies of O2a, not found in their regional neighbours who speak languages other than Austroasiatic, whilst their mtDNA haplogroups seem to be those frequent in their region independent of language affinity.<ref name="Chaubey et al 2010"/>

==Implications==
The Father Tongue hypothesis has far-reaching implications for several processes in linguistics such as [[language change]], [[language acquisition]] and [[sociolinguistics]].

The historical linguist George van Driem interpreted the correlation of Y-chromosomal haplogroups and language families as indicating that the spread of language families was often mediated by male-biased migration, whether these intrusions were martial or something less spectacular. He conjectured that the majority of language communities spoke father tongues rather than mother tongues.<ref name="van Driem 2012b">{{cite book|last=van Driem|first=George|title=Methods in Contemporary Linguistics|year=2012|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|editor=Andrea Ender, Adrian Leemann and Bernhard Wälchli|chapter=Etyma, shouldered adzes and molecular variants}}</ref>

Focusing on prehistoric [[language shift]] in already settled areas, examples worldwide<ref name="Forster and Renfrew 2011"/> show that as little as 10–20% of prehistoric male immigration can (but need not) cause a language switch, indicating an élite imposition such as may have happened with the appearance of the first farmers or metalworkers in the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages.

The Father Tongue hypothesis has implications for linguists' understanding of language change. It must be assumed that the dynamics of language change whereby mothers pass on the language of their spouses to their offspring differ from the dynamics of language change in a monolingual community and even from the dynamics of change in a bilingual community where mothers pass on their own language to their children.<ref name="van Driem 2008"/> As a consequence, such dynamics can introduce a discontinuity with the past. For example, it has been observed that [[Michif language|Michif]], genetically an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] (like [[Plains Cree]]), was [[Relexification|relexified]] by [[Métis people|Métis]] women with [[Métis French]], the language of their husbands, and so the genetic affinity of Michif has come to be almost unidentifiable.<ref name="Bakker 1992">{{cite book|last=Bakker|first=Pieter Jan|title=A language of our own: The genesis of Michif, the mixed Cree-French language of the Canadian Métis|year=1992|publisher=Universiteit van Amsterdam: doctoral dissertation|location=Amsterdam}}</ref><ref name="Bakker 1994">{{cite book|last=Bakker|first=Pieter Jan|title=Mixed Languages, 15 Case Studies in Language Intertwining (Studies in Language and Language Use, 13)|year=1994|publisher=Instituut voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek naar Taal en Taalgebruik|location=Amsterdam|pages=13–33|editor=Peter Bakker and Maarten Mous|chapter=Michif, the Cree-French mixed language of the Metis buffalo hunters in Canada}}</ref><ref name="van Driem 2001">{{cite book|last=van Driem|first=George|title=Languages of the Himalayas|year=2001|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden}}</ref> If the process of relexification went beyond the possibility of [[linguistic reconstruction]], the dynamics of such a process may obscure the true linguistic heritance of a community.<ref name="van Driem 2008"/>

==Exceptions==
Genetics does not determine the language spoken by a human being, and the link between Y-chromosomal haplogroups and linguistic affinities is an observed correlation and not a [[Causality|causal link]]. Therefore, it must be assumed that, while father tongues predominate, exceptions to father tongues exist in the world. Two very well-known exceptions are the [[Balti people|Balti]] in northern Pakistan and [[Hungarians]].
The mtDNA haplogroups most frequent among Balti are the same as those of the neighbouring Tibetan communities, whereas the Y-chromosomal haplogroups most frequent in Balti males appear to have entered Baltistan from the west with the introduction of Islam. The [[Balti language|Balti speak]] one of the most conservative [[Tibetan languages]].<ref name="van Driem 2007"/> The language of the Balti corresponds to the mtDNA and not to the Y chromosome and is in effect a salient example of a mother tongue.<ref name="van Driem 2012b"/>
The other well-known exception is [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. The [[Haplogroup N-M231|N1c haplogroup]] of the Y chromosome, distinguished by Tat-C deletion, is found at a high frequency throughout [[Uralic languages|Uralic language]] communities, but is virtually missing in Hungarian males. Therefore, while the intrusion of the [[Magyars]] into what is today Hungary is historically attested and has left clear linguistic evidence, genetically the Magyar intrusion has left no salient genetic traces. Instead, from a genetic point of view, Hungarians strongly resemble a [[West Slavic languages|Western Slavic language]] community.<ref name="van Driem 2008">{{cite book|last=van Driem|first=George|title=Chomolangma, Demawend und Kasbek: Festschrift für Roland Bielmeier zu seinem 65.
