'''Grammelot''' (or '''gromalot''')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gTs9xWJcgg|title=Commedia dell'Arte: Language|first=|last=National Theatre Discover|date=6 October 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> is a style of language used in satirical theatre, a [[gibberish]] with [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] and [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] elements, used in association with [[mime]] and [[mimicry]]. The satirical use of such a format may date back to the 16th century [[commedia dell'arte]]; the group of cognate terms appears to belong to the 20th century.

==History==

In an essay entitled “L’art du grommelot” (Le Figaro, April 20, 2006), French scholar Claude Duneton suggests the word (not the technique) – in its French form, ''grommelot'' – has its origins in the ''commedia dell’arte''-derived Italian theatre of the early part of the sixteenth century. Duneton studied briefly with Léon Chancerel (1886–1965), who was a major figure in this branch of theatre. Chancerel in fact uses the word in his book, ''Le théâtre et la jeunesse'' (Paris: Bourrellier 1946:47). Others, such as theatre scholar John Rudlin in ''Commedia dell'arte: An Actor's Handbook'' (London: Routledge 1994:60), suggest this origin as well.

While the historical origin of the term is unclear, it has been particularly popularized by the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]]-winning Italian [[playwright]] [[Dario Fo]]. His 1969 show ''[[Mistero Buffo]]'' ("''Comic Mystery Play''") was a satirical touring performance involving sketches based on mediaeval sources, told in Fo's own grammelots constructed from archaic [[Po Valley]] dialects and [[phoneme]]s from modern languages (he has coined separate Italian, French and American grammelots). In his Nobel lecture, Fo referred to the 16th-century Italian playwright [[Angelo Beolco|Ruzzante]]'s invention of a similar language based on Italian dialects, Latin, Spanish, German and onomatopoeic sounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/fo-lecture.html|title=Dario Fo - Nobel Lecture: Against Jesters Who Defame and Insult|publisher=}}</ref>

Another notable modern Italian exponent is the [[Milan]] actor/writer [[Gianni Ferrario]].<ref>[http://www.grammelot.com/eng_eng/ Grammelot.com], Gianni Ferrario</ref> [[Voice actor]] [[Carlo Bonomi]], also from Milan, used grammelot to voice [[Osvaldo Cavandoli]]'s cartoon [[La Linea (TV series)|La Linea]] and many years later, outside of Italy, [[Otmar Gutmann]]'s [[Pingu]]. Mainstream [[comedian|comics]] have also used Grammelot-like language: for instance, [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]]. The Canadian [[circus]] and entertainment troupe [[Cirque du Soleil]] uses in its routines similar forms of language; journalists often term them "Cirquish",<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/arts/theater-cirque-du-soleil-aiming-too-high.html Cirque Du Soleil: Aiming Too High?], Polly Shulman, Teatroenmiami.com</ref> but Cirque du Soleil's own staff use the word "Grommelot".<ref>Section 2, question 13: http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/fr/jobs/casting/faq.aspx{{dead link|date=August 2015}}</ref>
