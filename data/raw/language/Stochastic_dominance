'''Stochastic dominance''' is a [[Partially ordered set|partial order]] between [[random variable]]s.<ref name="HadarRussell1969">{{cite journal |last=Hadar |first=J. |last2=Russell |first2=W. |title=Rules for Ordering Uncertain Prospects |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=59 |issue=1 |year=1969 |pages=25–34 |jstor=1811090 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Bawa |first=Vijay S. |title=Optimal Rules for Ordering Uncertain Prospects |journal=Journal of Financial Economics |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=1975 |pages=95–121 |doi=10.1016/0304-405X(75)90025-2 }}</ref> It is a form of [[stochastic ordering]]. The concept arises in [[decision theory]] and [[decision analysis]] in situations where one gamble (a [[probability distribution]] over possible outcomes, also known as prospects) can be ranked as superior to another gamble for a broad class of decision-makers. It is based on shared [[preference (economics)|preference]]s regarding sets of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. Only limited knowledge of preferences is required for determining dominance.  [[Risk aversion]] is a factor only in second order stochastic dominance.

Stochastic dominance does not give a [[total order]], but rather only a [[partial order]]: for some pairs of gambles, neither one stochastically dominates the other, since different members of the broad class of decision-makers will differ regarding which gamble is preferable without them generally being considered to be equally attractive.

==Statewise dominance==

The simplest case  of stochastic dominance is '''statewise dominance''' (also known as '''state-by-state dominance'''), defined as follows:

: Gamble A is statewise dominant over gamble B if A gives at least as good a result in every state (every possible set of outcomes), and a strictly better result in at least one state.

For example, if a dollar is added to one or more prizes in a lottery, the new lottery statewise dominates the old one because it yields a better payout regardless of the specific numbers realized by the lottery. Similarly, if a risk insurance policy has a lower premium and a better coverage than another policy, then with or without damage, the outcome is better. Anyone who prefers more to less (in the standard terminology, anyone who has [[monotonic]]ally increasing preferences) will always prefer a statewise dominant gamble.

==First-order==

Statewise dominance is a special case of the canonical  '''first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)'''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Quirk | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Saposnik | first2 = R. | year = 1962 | title = Admissibility and Measurable Utility Functions | url = | journal = [[Review of Economic Studies]] | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 140–146 | doi=10.2307/2295819}}</ref> FSD is defined as follows:

: Gamble A has first-order stochastic dominance over gamble B if for any outcome ''x'', A gives at least as high a probability of receiving at least ''x'' as does B, and for some ''x'', A gives a higher probability of receiving at least ''x''. In notation form, <math>P [A \ge x]\ge P [B \ge x]</math> for all ''x'', and for some ''x'', <math>P[A \ge x]>P[B \ge x]</math>.

In terms of the [[cumulative distribution function]]s of the two gambles, A dominating B means that <math>F_A(x) \le F_B(x)</math> for all ''x'', with strict inequality at some&nbsp;''x''.

Gamble A first-order stochastically dominates gamble B [[if and only if]] every [[expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]] maximizer with an increasing [[utility|utility function]] prefers gamble A over gamble B.

First-order stochastic dominance can also be expressed as follows: If and only if A first-order stochastically dominates B, there exists some gamble <math>y</math> such that <math>x_B \overset {d}{=} (x_A+y)</math> where <math>y\le 0</math> in all possible states (and strictly negative in at least one state); here <math>\overset{d}{=}</math> means "[[Random variable#Equality in distribution|is equal in distribution to]]" (that is, "has the same distribution as").  Thus, we can go from the graphed density function of A to that of B by, roughly speaking, pushing some of the probability mass to the left.

For example, consider a single toss of a fair die with the six possible outcomes (states) summarized in this table along with the amount won in each state by each of three alternative gambles:

: <math>
\begin{array}{rcccccc}
\text{State (die result)} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
\text{Gamble A wins }\$ & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
\text{Gamble B wins }\$ & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
\text{Gamble C wins }\$ & 3 & 3 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
</math>

Here gamble A statewise dominates gamble B because A gives at least as good a yield in all possible states (outcomes of the die roll) and gives a strictly better yield in one of them (state 3). Since A statewise dominates B, it also first-order dominates B. Gamble C does not statewise dominate B because B gives a better yield in states 4 through 6, but C first-order stochastically dominates B because Pr(B ≥ 1) = Pr(C ≥ 1) = 1, Pr(B ≥ 2) = Pr(C ≥ 2) = 3/6, and Pr(B ≥ 3) = 0 while Pr(C ≥ 3) = 3/6 > Pr(B ≥ 3). Gambles A and C cannot be ordered relative to each other on the basis of first-order stochastic dominance because Pr(A ≥ 2) = 4/6 > Pr(C ≥ 2) = 3/6 while on the other hand Pr(C ≥ 3) = 3/6 > Pr(A ≥ 3) = 0.

In general, although when one gamble first-order stochastically dominates a second gamble, the expected value of the payoff under the first will be greater than the expected value of the payoff under the second, the converse is not true: one cannot order lotteries with regard to stochastic dominance simply by comparing the means of their probability distributions. For instance, in the above example C has a higher mean (2) than does A (5/3), yet C does not first-order dominate A.

==Second-order==

The other commonly used type of stochastic dominance is '''second-order stochastic dominance'''.<ref name="HadarRussell1969" /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hanoch | first1 = G. | last2 = Levy | first2 = H. | year = 1969 | title = The Efficiency Analysis of Choices Involving Risk | url = | journal = Review of Economic Studies | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 335–346 | doi=10.2307/2296431}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rothschild | first1 = M. |authorlink=Michael Rothschild | last2 = Stiglitz | first2 = J.

A Definition | journal = [[Journal of Economic Theory]] | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 225–243 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(70)90038-4 }}</ref> Roughly speaking, for two gambles A and B, gamble A has second-order stochastic dominance over gamble B if the former is more predictable (i.e. involves less risk) and has at least as high a mean.  All [[risk aversion|risk-averse]] [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected-utility maximizers]] (that is, those with increasing and concave utility functions) prefer a second-order stochastically dominant gamble to a dominated one. Second-order dominance describes the shared preferences of a smaller class of decision-makers (those for whom more is better ''and'' who are averse to risk, rather than ''all'' those for whom more is better) than does first-order dominance.

In terms of cumulative distribution functions <math>F_A</math> and <math>F_B</math>, A is second-order stochastically dominant over B if and only if the area under <math>F_A</math> from minus infinity to <math>x</math> is less than or equal to that under <math>F_B</math> from minus infinity to <math>x</math> for all real numbers <math>x</math>, with strict inequality at some <math>x</math>; that is, <math>\int_{-\infty}^x [F_B(t) - F_A(t)] \, dt \geq 0</math> for all <math>x</math>, with strict inequality at some <math>x</math>. Equivalently, <math>A</math> dominates <math>B</math> in the second order if and only if <math>\operatorname{E}[u(A)] \geq \operatorname{E}[u(B)]</math> for all nondecreasing and [[concave function|concave]] utility functions <math>u(x)</math>.

Second-order stochastic dominance can also be expressed as follows: Gamble A second-order stochastically dominates B if and only if there exist some gambles <math>y</math> and <math>z</math> such that  <math>x_B \overset {d}{=} (x_A + y + z)</math>, with <math>y</math> always less than or equal to zero, and with <math>\operatorname{E}(z\mid x_A+y)=0</math> for all values of <math>x_A+y</math>. Here the introduction of random variable <math>y</math> makes B first-order stochastically dominated by A (making B disliked by those with an increasing utility function), and the introduction of random variable <math>z</math> introduces a [[mean-preserving spread]] in B which is disliked by those with concave utility. Note that if A and B have the same mean (so that the random variable <math>y</math> degenerates to the fixed number 0), then B is a mean-preserving spread of A.

===Sufficient conditions for second-order stochastic dominance===

* First-order stochastic dominance of ''A'' over ''B'' is a sufficient condition  for second-order dominance of ''A'' over ''B''.
* If ''B'' is a mean-preserving spread of ''A'', then ''A'' second-order stochastically dominates ''B''.

===Necessary conditions for second-order stochastic dominance===

* <math>\operatorname{E}_A(x) \geq \operatorname{E}_B(x)</math> is a necessary condition for ''A'' to second-order stochastically dominate ''B''.
* <math>\min_A(x)\geq \min_B(x)</math> is a necessary condition for ''A'' to second-order dominate ''B''. The condition implies that the left tail of <math>F_B</math> must be thicker than the left tail of <math>F_A</math>.

==Third-order==
Let <math>F_A</math> and <math>F_B</math> be the cumulative distribution functions of two distinct investments <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>. <math>A</math> dominates <math>B</math> in '''the third order''' if and only if

* <math>\int_{-\infty}^x \int_{-\infty}^z [F_B(t) - F_A(t)] \, dt \, dz \geq 0 \text{ for all } x,</math>
* <math>\operatorname{E}_A(x) \geq \operatorname{E}_B(x), \, </math>

and there is at least one strict inequality. Equivalently, <math>A</math> dominates <math>B</math> in the third order if and only if <math>\operatorname{E}_AU(x) \geq \operatorname{E}_BU(x)</math> for all nondecreasing, concave utility functions <math>U</math> that are '''positively skewed''' (that is, have a positive third derivative throughout).

===Sufficient condition===

* Second-order stochastic dominance is a sufficient condition.

===Necessary conditions===

* <math>\operatorname{E}_A(\log(x))\geq \operatorname{E}_B(\log(x))</math> is a necessary condition. The condition implies that the geometric mean of <math>A</math> must be greater than or equal to the geometric mean of <math>B</math>.
* <math>\min_A(x)\geq\min_B(x)</math> is a necessary condition. The condition implies that the left tail of <math>F_B</math> must be thicker than the left tail of <math>F_A</math>.

==Higher-order==

Higher orders of stochastic dominance have also been analyzed, as have generalizations of the dual relationship between stochastic dominance orderings and classes of preference functions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ekern |first1=Steinar |title=Increasing ''N''th Degree Risk |journal=Economics Letters |date=1980 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=329–333 |doi=10.1016/0165-1765(80)90005-1}}</ref>
Arguably the most powerful dominance criterion relies on the accepted economic assumption of [[Risk aversion#Absolute risk aversion|Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion]] (DARA); see

The DARA SD criterion involves several analytical challenges and a research effort is on its way to address those; see, e.g.,

==Constraints==

Stochastic dominance relations may be used as constraints in problems of [[mathematical optimization]], in particular [[stochastic programming]].<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Darinka Dentcheva |last=Dentcheva |first=D. |authorlink2=Andrzej Piotr Ruszczyński |last2=Ruszczyński |first2=A. |title=Optimization with Stochastic Dominance Constraints |journal=SIAM Journal on Optimization |volume=14 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=548–566 |doi=10.1137/S1052623402420528 |citeseerx=10.1.1.201.7815 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kuosmanen | first1 = T | year = 2004 | title = Efficient diversification according to stochastic dominance criteria | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 1390–1406 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.1040.0284}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Darinka Dentcheva |last=Dentcheva |first=D. |authorlink2=Andrzej Piotr Ruszczyński |last2=Ruszczyński |first2=A. |title=Semi-Infinite Probabilistic Optimization: First Order Stochastic Dominance Constraints |journal=Optimization |volume=53 |issue=5–6 |year=2004 |pages=583–601 |doi=10.1080/02331930412331327148 }}</ref>In a problem of maximizing a real functional <math> f(X)</math> over random variables <math> X </math> in a set <math> X_0 </math> we may additionally require that <math> X </math> stochastically dominates a fixed random ''benchmark'' <math> B </math>. In these problems, [[utility]] functions play the role of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s associated with 
stochastic dominance constraints. Under appropriate conditions, the solution of the problem is also a (possibly local) solution of the problem to maximize
<math> f(X) + \operatorname{E}[u(X) - u(B)] </math> over <math> X </math> in <math> X_0 </math>, where <math> u(x) </math> is a certain utility function. If the
first order stochastic dominance constraint is employed, the utility function <math> u(x) </math> is [[monotonic function|nondecreasing]]; 
if the second order stochastic dominance constraint is used, <math> u(x) </math> is [[monotonic function|nondecreasing]] and [[concave function|concave]].
