'''Music Canada''' (formerly '''Canadian Recording Industry Association''' ('''CRIA''')) is a [[Toronto]]-based, [[non-profit]] [[Industry trade group|trade organization]] that was founded 9 April 1963 to represent the interests of companies that record, manufacture, produce, promote and distribute music in [[Canada]]. It also offers benefits to some of Canada's leading independent record labels and distributors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musiccanada.com/About.aspx|title=About Music Canada|publisher=Music Canada|accessdate=July 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730182722/http://musiccanada.com/About.aspx|archivedate=July 30, 2013|df=}}</ref>

==History==
Originally formed as the 10-member Canadian Record Manufacturer's Association, the association changed its name to Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) in 1972 and opened membership to other record industry companies.<ref name="tce">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000587|title=Canadian Recording Industry Association|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=December 8, 2009}}</ref> 

In 2006, the CRIA was in the news when a number of smaller labels resigned their memberships, complaining that the organization wasn't representing their interests.<ref name="Inc.2006">{{cite journal|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=Indie Revolt Up North|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18|date=29 April 2006|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=18–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> In 2011, it changed its name to '''Music Canada''' offering special benefits to some of the leading independent labels and distributors in Canada.<ref name="Music Canada is born">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/global/canadian-recording-industry-association-1005268822.story|title=Canadian Recording Industry Association Changes Name|work=Billboard|accessdate=July 10, 2011}}</ref>

==Organization==
Music Canada is governed by a [[board of directors]] who are elected annually by association members. To be eligible for election a candidate for the board must be among the [[Corporate title|executive officer]]s of the member companies. [[Graham Henderson (Canadian lawyer)|Graham Henderson]] of [[Universal Music Canada]] has been president since 15 November 2004; Brian Robertson previously held the position from 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cria.ca/news/210904_n.php|title=Long time recording industry President Brian Robertson to step down; Graham Henderson to succeed|publisher=CRIA|date=21 September 2004|accessdate=8 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050302215309/http://cria.ca/news/210904_n.php|archivedate=2 March 2005|df=}}</ref>

Members are divided into 3 classes:<ref name="tce"/>
*'''Class A''' members are Canadian individuals or companies whose principal business is producing, manufacturing, or marketing sound recordings. These members hold voting rights, and currently consist of the [[Big Four record labels|"big four" record labels]].<ref name="geist1">{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2230/125/|title=LeBlanc on HMV and CRIA Stats|last=Geist|first=Michael|date=12 September 2007|accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref>
*'''Class B''' members are Canadian individuals or companies whose principal business is producing sound recordings. These members pay a $600 annual membership fee but have no voting rights. As of 2007, there were 22 class B members.<ref name="geist1"/>
*'''Manufacturing Division''' members are Canadian individuals or companies whose principal business is manufacturing sound recordings.

==Other services==
Music Canada is responsible for the distribution of [[ISRC]] registrant codes within Canada, and also works with the [[IFPI]] and [[RIAA]] to try to prevent copyright infringement of artists' work.

==Representation==
Historically, Music Canada has represented all record labels in the country. Recently, however, some labels and other industry groups have publicly disagreed with Music Canada and claim it no longer represents them. In 2006, six well-known "indie" labels including [[Nettwerk]] left Music Canada in a dispute over [[Canadian content]] rules. They claimed the association was only protecting the interests of "the four major foreign multi-national labels,"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/04/13/cria-indie-crtc.html|title=Indie labels break with CRIA over commercial radio proposal|publisher=[[CBC.ca|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=13 April 2009|accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref> referring to [[EMI Music Canada|EMI]], [[Universal Music Canada|Universal]], [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment|Sony BMG]], and [[Warner Music Canada|Warner]]. Other points of contention include Music Canada's stance against the [[Private copying levy#Canada|blank media tax]], their support for digital locks on music,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/4244/125/|title=Manitoba Music Industry Association Distances Self From CRIA On Copyright Reform|last=Geist|first=Michael|date=6 August 2009|accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref> and positions against copyright reform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/008.nsf/eng/02870.html|title=Copyright Consulations - Canadian Music Creators Coalition (CMCC)|publisher=[[Industry Canada]]|date=11 September 2009|accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref> In 2007 a group of musicians formed the [[Canadian Music Creators Coalition]], claiming "legislative proposals that would facilitate lawsuits against our fans or increase the labels' control over the enjoyment of music are made not in our names, but on behalf of the labels' foreign parent companies."

==Legal actions==
On February 16, 2004, Music Canada applied to the [[Federal Court of Canada|Federal Court]] to force five major Canadian [[internet service provider]]s — [[Shaw Communications]] Inc., [[Telus]] Corp., [[Rogers Communications|Rogers Cable]], [[Bell Canada]]'s [[Bell Sympatico|Sympatico]] service and Quebec's [[Vidéotron]] — to hand over the names of 29 people accused of [[copyright infringement]] through [[peer-to-peer file sharing]]. On April 2005, [[Vidéotron]] indicated its willingness to supply customer information to Music Canada.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chartattack.com/news/38505/canadian-file-sharing-lawsuits-moving-ahead-videotron-to-reveal-names | title = Canadian File Sharing Lawsuits Moving Ahead, Vidéotron To Reveal Names | publisher = ChartAttack.com | first = Stephanie | last=Joudrey | date = 2005-04-22 | accessdate = 2009-08-10 }}</ref>

On March 31, 2004, in the case of ''[[BMG v. John Doe]]'', Justice [[Konrad von Finckenstein]] of the [[Federal Court of Canada]] ruled that making music available for download over the [[Internet]] was not equivalent to distribution and was thus noninfringing. The Justice compared the [[peer-to-peer filesharing]] activities to "having a photocopier in a library room full of copyrighted material" and wrote that there was no evidence of unauthorized distribution presented.<ref>{{cite court |litigants = BMG Canada Inc. v. John Doe |opinion = 488 |court = F.C. |reporter = FC|year = 2004 |url= http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2004/2004fc488/2004fc488.html }}</ref> The [[Federal Court of Appeal]] upheld the lower courts ruling denying the disclosure of the customers' identities, but, in reference to "what would or would not constitute infringement of copyright," stated: "such conclusions should not have been made in the very preliminary stages of this action, since they would require a consideration of the evidence as well as the law applicable to such evidence after it has been properly adduced, and could be damaging to the parties if a trial takes place."<ref>{{cite court| litigants = BMG Canada Inc. v. John Doe |opinion = 193 |court =F.C.A |year = 2005 |reporter=FCA | url=http://reports.fja.gc.ca/en/2005/2005fca193/2005fca193.html}}</ref>
The [[Copyright Board of Canada]] earlier that year had included downloading music in the list of "[[private copying]]" activities for which [[tariffs]] on blank media applied. (Private copying is the act of copying music for personal use from a noninfringing source, and is itself noninfringing.) That made it extremely unlikely that downloaders could be successfully prosecuted, leaving only the  possibility of acting against uploaders, those supplying the works to others on the networks. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
In 2008, the operators of the [[isoHunt]] website filed a motion with the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] seeking a [[declaratory judgment]] affirming the legality of their operation. The motion was denied, and the court ruled a full trial was needed. This decision was appealed by the operators of isoHunt; the appeal was also denied. In late 2009, isoHunt filed a formal suit against Music Canada and the four "major" record labels seeking "declaratory relief to clarify its legal rights."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isohunt.com/img/legal/Statement%20of%20Claim%20-%20isoHunt%20vs%20CRIA%20members.pdf|title=Statement of Claim - isoHunt vs CRIA members|date=19 November 2009}}</ref>

Additionally, in October 2008, the four main members of Music Canada were sued by the estate of [[Chet Baker]] and several other artists for copyright infringement. The major claims in this lawsuit are as follows:

*That some three hundred thousand works were illegally distributed by the Music Canada's members, and
*That they failed to seek proper licensing and distribution agreements with the creators of the aforementioned works, instead placing the works on what is colloquially referred to as a "pending list" (i.e., any payments to be made for the use of the aforementioned works are reserved, pending an agreement with the artists who created the works).

As the standard punitive damages for each act of infringement is set at $20,000, and there are three hundred thousand works on the "pending lists", Music Canada could have faced punitive damages of a minimum of $6 billion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/735096--geist-record-industry-faces-liability-over-infringement|title=Geist: Record industry faces liability over infringement|date=7 December 2009 | location=Toronto | work=The Star}}</ref> On November 8, 2011, the suit was settled out of court for over $45 million.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gardner |first=Eriq |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/universal-music-chet-baker-lawsuit-260608 |title=Why Universal Music Sued Its Insurer Over a $14.4 Million Payment to Musicians (Analysis) |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 12, 2011 |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref>

*Note that Music Canada certifies Digital-downloads (and from September 12, 2016, any singles) always applying the most recent certifications-levels, even to those titles that are released during the time frame the CRIA (currently Music Canada) had lower certification-levels for Digital-downloads. One such example is the single "[[Right Round]]" by [[Flo Rida]] feat. [[Kesha]], which was released in January 2009 when certification-levels for Digital-downloads were 10,000 units for Gold and 20,000 units for Platinum. The CRIA (currently Music Canada) certified it three times Platinum in October 2010, applying the latest certification-levels for sales of 240,000 units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cria.ca/gold/1010_g.php |title=Gold & Platinum Certifications: October 2010 |publisher=CRIA |accessdate=2014-10-12 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029215339/http://www.cria.ca/gold/1010_g.php |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}</ref>
