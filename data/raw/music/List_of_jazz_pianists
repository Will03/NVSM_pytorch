<!-- Only notable pianists with their own main articles should be included in this list. See WP:MUSIC  for notability requirements. -->
This is an alphabetized list of notable musicians who play or played [[jazz piano]]. The piano has been an integral part of the jazz idiom since its inception, in both solo and ensemble settings. Its role is multifaceted due largely to the instrument's combined melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic capabilities. <!--Only add names here if the person has their own article on Wikipedia, please. Anything else will be removed.-->
