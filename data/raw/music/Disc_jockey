A '''disc jockey''', often abbreviated as '''DJ''', is a person who plays existing recorded [[music]] for a live audience. Most common types of DJs include [[Radio personality|radio DJ]], club DJ who performs  at a [[nightclub]] or [[music festival]] and [[turntablism|turntablist]] who uses record players, usually [[turntable]]s, to manipulate sounds on [[phonograph record]]s. Originally, the disc in disc jockey referred to [[gramophone record]]s, but now DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[Compact disc|CDs]] or [[digital audio file]]s on a [[CDJ]] or [[laptop]]. The title DJ is commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s. In recent years it has become common for DJs to be featured as the credited artist on tracks they produced despite having a guest vocalist that performs the entire song: like for example [[Uptown Funk]].

DJs use audio equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]] to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when played together or to enable a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized [[DJ mixer]]s, small [[Audio console|audio mixers]] with [[crossfader]] and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions to blend or transition from one song to another. Mixers are also used to pre-listen to sources of recorded music in [[headphones]] and adjust upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be used with a [[DJ controller]] device to mix audio files on a computer instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.

==Description==
Originally, the "disc" in "disc jockey" referred to [[gramophone record]]s, but now "DJ" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including [[vinyl records]], [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[CD]]s, or [[digital audio file]]s stored on [[USB flash drive|USB stick]] or [[laptop]]. DJs typically perform for a live audience in a [[nightclub]] or dance club or a TV, radio broadcast audience, or in the 2010s, an [[online radio]] audience. DJs also create mixes, remixes and tracks that are recorded for later sale and distribution. In [[hip hop music]], DJs may create beats, using percussion [[Break (music)|break]]s, [[bassline]]s and other musical content [[sampling (music)|sampled]] from pre-existing records. In hip hop, rappers and MCs use these beats to [[rapping|rap]] over.

DJs use equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]]. This allows the DJ to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when they are played together, either so two records can be played at the same time, or to enable the DJ to make a smooth transition from one song to another. An important tool for DJs is the specialized [[DJ mixer]], a small [[audio console|audio mixer]] with a [[crossfader]]  and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions. The crossfader enables the DJ to blend or transition from one song to another. The cue knobs or switches allow the DJ to listen to a source of recorded music in [[headphones]] before playing it for the live club or broadcast audience. Previewing the music in headphones helps the DJ pick the next track they want to play, [[cue (audio)|cue up]] the track to the desired starting location, and align the two tracks' beats in traditional situations where auto sync technology is not being used. This process ensures that the selected song will mix well with the currently playing music. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects; and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.

The title "DJ" is also commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s as a title to denote their profession (e.g., [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[DJ Qbert]], [[DJ Shadow]] and [[DJ Yoda]]). Some DJs focus on creating a good mix of songs for the club dancers or radio audience. Other DJs use [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]], in which the DJ or [[turntablism|turntablist]] manipulates the [[phonograph|record player turntable]] to create new rhythms and sounds. DJs need to have a mixture of artistic and technical skills for their profession, because they have to understand both the creative aspects of making new musical beats and tracks, and the technical aspects of using [[mixing console]]s, professional audio equipment, and, in the 2010s, [[digital audio workstation]]s and other computerized music gear. In many types of DJing, including club DJing and radio/TV DJing, a DJ also has to have [[charisma]] and develop a good rapport with the audience. Professional DJs often specialize in a specific genre of music, such as [[house music]] or [[hip hop music]]. DJs typically have an extensive knowledge about the music they specialize in. Many DJs are avid music collectors of vintage, rare or obscure tracks and records.

==Types==

===Radio DJs===
{{Main|Radio personality}}

Radio DJs or [[radio personality|radio personalities]] introduce and play music that is broadcast on [[AM broadcasting|AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[Digital radio|digital]] or [[Internet radio]] stations.

===Club DJs===

[[File:20021101 TRANSPLANT 10 - TALPA live - unedited.webm|thumb|right|A DJ at a techno party in 2002 in Serbia]]
Club DJs, commonly referred as DJs in general, play music at musical events, such as parties at [[Nightclub|music venues]] or [[bar]]s, [[music festival]]s, corporate and private events. Typically, club DJs mix music recordings from two or more sources using different mixing techniques in order to produce non-stopping flow of music. One key technique used for seamlessly transitioning from one song to another is [[beatmatching]]. A DJ who mostly plays and mixes one specific music genre is often given the title of that genre; for example, a DJ who plays hip hop music is called a hip hop DJ, a DJ who plays house music is a house DJ, a DJ who plays techno is called a techno DJ, and so on. The quality of a DJ performance (often called a DJ mix or DJ set) consists of two main features: technical skills, or how well can DJ operate the equipment and produce smooth transitions between two or more recordings and a playlist, or ability of a DJ to select most suitable recordings also known as "reading the crowd".<ref>[https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2011/12/how-to-read-a-crowd-and-what-happens-if-you-dont/ How To Read A Crowd (And What Happens If You Donâ€™t)], ''Digital DJ Tips'', 3 November 2017</ref>

===Turntablists===
{{Main|Turntablism}}

Turntablists, also called battle DJs, use [[Phonograph|turntables]] and [[DJ mixer]] to manipulate recorded sounds in order to produce new music.  In essence, they use DJ equipment as a musical instrument. The most known turntablist technique is [[scratching]]. Turntablists often participate in DJ contests like [[DMC World DJ Championships]] and Red Bull 3Style.<ref>[http://www.redbullthre3style.com/ Red Bull 3Style]</ref>

==Equipment==

[[File:Spooky.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[DJ Spooky]] at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2003, using two [[Technics SL-1200]] turntables and a DJ mixer]]
As music technology has progressed, DJs have adopted different types of equipment to play and mix music, all of which are still commonly used. Traditionally, DJs used two [[turntable]]s plugged into a [[DJ mixer]] to mix music on vinyl records. As [[compact disc]]s became popular media for publishing music, specialized high quality CD players known as [[CDJ]]s were developed for DJs. CDJs can take the place of turntables or be used together with turntables. Many CDJs can now play digital music files from [[USB flash drive]]s or [[Secure Digital|SD cards]] in addition to CDs. With the spread of portable [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet]], and [[smartphone]] computers, DJs began using software together with specialized [[sound card]]s and [[DJ controller]] hardware. DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer or be used instead of a hardware mixer.

===Turntables===
{{Main|Turntablism}}
[[Turntable]]s allow DJs to play vinyl records. By adjusting the playback speed of the turntable, either by adjusting the speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the [[tempo]]s of different records so their rhythms can be played together at the same time without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as [[beatmatching]]. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keeps the record moving in sync with the turntable with a [[slipmat]] that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. [[Direct-drive turntable]]s are the type preferred by DJs, with the [[Technics SL-1200]] being the most popular model of turntables for DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play [[hip hop]] music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for [[scratching]], [[beat juggling]], and other [[turntablism]] techniques.

===CDJs===
{{Main|CDJ}}
CDJs are high quality digital media players made for DJing. They often have large jog wheels and [[pitch control]]s to allow DJs to manipulate the playback of digital files for [[beatmatching]] similar to how DJs manipulate vinyl records on turntables. CDJs often have features such as loops and waveform displays similar to DJ software. Originally designed to play music from [[compact disc]]s, they now can play digital music files stored on [[USB flash drive]]s and [[Secure Digital|SD card]]s. Some CDJs can also connect to a computer running DJ software to act as a [[DJ controller]].

===DJ mixers===
{{Main|DJ mixer}}
[[File:DJ Mixer.JPG|thumb|upright|right|A [[Numark (DJ equipment)|Numark]] DM2002X Pro Master DJ mixer. This three channel mixer can have up to three input sound sources. The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] control knobs and [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] control knobs allow the volume and tone of each sound source to be adjusted. The vertical faders allow for further adjustment of the volume of each sound source. The horizontally-mounted [[crossfader (audio engineering)|crossfader]] enables the DJ to smoothly transition from a [[song]] on one sound source to a song from a different sound source.]]
DJ mixers are small audio [[mixing console]]s specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than a mixer used by a [[record producer]] or [[audio engineer]]; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard [[recording studio]] mixers have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have many of the same features found on larger mixers (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, [[effects unit]]s, etc.), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the [[crossfader]]. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a [[DJ controller]] instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.

===Headphones===
{{Main|Headphones}}
DJs generally use higher quality headphones than those designed for music consumers. DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate the sounds of the headphones from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and pivot joints to allow DJs to listen to one side of the headphones, while turning the other headphone away (so he/she can monitor the mix in the club), and replaceable cables. Replaceable cables enables DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.

Closed-back headphones are highly recommended for DJs to block outside noise as the environment of DJ usually tend to be very noisy. Standard headphones have 3.5mm jack but DJ equipment usually requires Â¼ inch jack. Most of specialized DJ Headphones have an adapter to switch between 3.5mm jack and Â¼ inch jack. Detachable coiled cables are perfect for DJ Headphones.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.getaheadphone.com/the-5-best-dj-headphones-of-2016/|title = Best DJ Headphones| accessdate =27 October 2016|year=2016|author=GetAHeadphone}}</ref>

===Software===
{{See also|List of music software#DJ software}}
[[File:Mixxx-1.11.0-Deere.png|thumb|left|A [[screenshot]] of [[Mixxx]] DJ software running on [[Mac OS X]]]]

DJs have changed their equipment as new technologies are introduced. The earliest DJs in pop music, in 1970s discos, used [[phonograph|record turntable]]s, vinyl records and [[audio console]]s. In the 1970s, DJs would have to lug heavy direct drive turntables and crates of records to clubs and shows. In the 1980s, many DJs transitioned to [[compact cassette]]s. In the 1990s and 2000s, many DJs switched to using [[digital audio]] such as [[CD]]s and [[MP3]] files. As technological advances made it practical to store large collections of digital music files on a [[laptop]] computer, DJ software was developed so DJs could use a laptop as a source of music instead of transporting CDs or vinyl records to gigs. Unlike most [[media player (software)|music player software]] designed for [[consumer electronics|regular consumers]], DJ software can play at least two audio files simultaneously, display the [[waveform]]s of the files on screen and enable the DJ to listen to either source.

The waveforms allow the DJ see what is coming next in the music and how the playback of different files is aligned. The software analyzes music files to identify their tempo and where the beats are. The analyzed information can be used by the DJ to help manually [[beatmatch]] like with vinyl records or the software can automatically synchronize the beats. [[Digital signal processing]] algorithms in software allow DJs to adjust the [[tempo]] of recordings independently of their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (and musical [[key (music)|key]], a feature known as "keylock". Some software analyzes the loudness of the music for automatic normalization with [[ReplayGain]] and detects the musical key. Additionally, DJ software can store cue points, set loops, and apply [[effects unit|effects]].

As [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became widespread, DJ software was written to run on these devices in addition to laptops.
DJ software requires specialized hardware in addition to a computer to fully take advantage of its features. The consumer grade, regular [[sound card]] integrated into most computer motherboards can only output two channels (one stereo pair). However, DJs need to be able to output at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or a main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer motherboards.

===Timecode===
Special vinyl records (or CDs/digital files played with [[CDJ]]s) can be used with DJ software to play digital music files with DJ software as if they were pressed onto vinyl, allowing [[turntablism]] techniques to be used with digital files. These vinyl records do not have music recordings pressed on to them. Instead, they are pressed with a special signal, referred to as "timecode", to control DJ software. The DJ software interprets changes in the playback speed, direction, and position of the timecode signal and manipulates the digital files it is playing in the same way that the turntable manipulates the timecode record.

This requires a specialized DJ [[sound card]] with at least 4 channels (2 stereo pairs) of inputs and outputs. With this setup, the DJ software typically outputs unmixed signals from the music files to an external hardware [[DJ mixer]]. Some DJ mixers have integrated [[USB]] sound cards that allow DJ software to connect directly to the mixer without requiring a separate sound card.

===DJ controllers===
{{Main|DJ controller}}
DJ software can be used to mix audio files on the computer instead of a separate hardware mixer. When mixing on a computer, DJs often use a [[DJ controller]] device that mimics the layout of two turntables plus a DJ mixer to control the software rather than the [[computer keyboard]] & [[touchpad]] on a laptop, or the [[touchscreen]] on a [[tablet computer]] or [[smartphone]]. Many DJ controllers have an integrated [[sound card]] with 4 output channels (2 stereo pairs) that allows the DJ to use headphones to preview music before playing it on the main output.

===Other equipment===
* A [[microphone]], so that the DJ can introduce songs and speak to the audience over the sound system.
* Electronic [[effects unit]]s such as [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[reverb]], [[octave]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]], [[chorus effect|chorus]], etc.
* Multi-stylus head shells, which allow a DJ to play different grooves of the same record at the same time.
* [[Sampler (musical instrument)|Sampler]]s, [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], electronic musical keyboards ([[synthesizer]]s), or [[drum machine]]s.
* [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]] ([[power amplifier]]s and [[speaker enclosure]]s), typically including [[subwoofer]] cabinets for deep bass (or, if a DJ is broadcasting and/or recording a set, broadcasting equipment or recording gear)
*[[Foldback (sound engineering)|Monitor speaker]]s, for listening to the "house mix" that is playing over the main speakers

==Techniques==
[[File:DJ Grand Wizzard Theodore (right), inventor of vinyl record scratching technique.jpg|thumb|In the early 1970s in the South Bronx, a young teen DJ named "Grand Wizzard Theodore" invented the "DJ scratch" technique. Other DJs, like Grandmaster Flash, took the technique to higher levels to the familiar sound and technique we hear today.]]
Several techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the [[cueing (playback)|cueing]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.

Club DJ turntable techniques include [[beatmatching]], [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[slip-cueing]] to preserve energy on a dance floor. [[Turntablism]] embodies the art of cutting, [[beat juggling]], [[scratching]], [[Needle drop (DJing)|needle drop]]s, [[phase shifting]], [[back spinning]] and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a [[musical instrument]] rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use [[harmonic mixing]] to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmonic mixing: The Basics|url=http://www.harmonic-mixing.com/HowTo.aspx|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Mixes Remixes|url=http://www.surroundsounddj.com/dj-mixes-remixes/|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>

Recent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[beatmatching]], which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic [[synchronization]] of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled "sync". Most [[DJ mixer]]s now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in [[beats per minute]] (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.

In the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815205546/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |archivedate=15 August 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>

During a DJ tour for the release of the French group [[Justice (band)|Justice]]'s ''A Cross the Universe'' in November 2008, controversy arose when a photograph of AugÃ© DJing with an unplugged [[Akai]] MPD24 surfaced. The photograph sparked accusations that Justice's live sets were faked. AugÃ© has since said that the equipment was unplugged very briefly before being reattached and the band put a three-photo set of the incident on their MySpace page.<ref>{{cite web

==History==
*''For the history of club DJs, see [[History of DJing]]''
*''For the history of radio DJs, see [[Radio disc jockey history]]''

The term "disc jockey" was ostensibly coined by radio gossip commentator [[Walter Winchell]] in 1935, and the phrase first appeared in print in a 1941 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, used to describe [[radio personality|radio personalities]] who introduced [[phonograph record]]s on the air.<ref name="Trove">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/arts/music/17jazz.html?pagewanted=all|title=Museum Acquires Storied Trove of Performances by Jazz Greats|author=Rohter, Larry|date=16 August 2010|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref><ref name=OED>{{cite web|title=OED Appeals|url=http://public.oed.com/appeals/disc-jockey/|website=oed.com|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=19 September 2016}}</ref> Playing recorded music for dancing and parties rose with the mass marketing of home [[phonograph]]s in the late 19th century, and [[Jimmy Savile]] is credited with hosting the first live DJ dance party in 1943. Savile is also credited as the first to present music in continuous play by using multiple turntables. In 1947, the Whiskey A Go-Go opened in Paris as the first [[discoteque]].<ref name="UF">{{cite web|title=So You Want To Be A DJ?

In the 1960s, [[Sound system (Jamaican)|Jamaican sound system]] culture emerged, with Jamaican [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejay]]s such as [[King Tubby]] and [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] pioneering [[dub music]] in the late 1960s.<ref name="veal">Michael Veal (2013), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kYtiAgAAQBAJ&pg=PP54 ''Dub: Soundscapes and Shattered Songs in Jamaican Reggae'', pages 26-44, "Electronic Music in Jamaica"], [[Wesleyan University Press]]</ref><ref name="cambridge20">Nicholas Collins, Margaret Schedel, Scott Wilson (2013), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bQeAtG97BmEC&pg=PA20 ''Electronic Music: Cambridge Introductions to Music'', page 20], [[Cambridge University Press]]</ref> They experimented with [[Tape music|tape-based composition]], emphasized repetitive rhythmic structures (often stripped of their harmonic elements), electronically manipulated spatiality, sonically manipulated pre-recorded musical materials from mass media, deejays toasted (boastful chanting) over pre-recorded music,<ref name="veal"/> and they [[remix]]ed music.<ref name="cambridge20"/> Jamaican deejays later had a significant impact on hip hop DJs in the 1970s.<ref name="veal"/><ref name="cambridge20"/>

[[File:Technics 1200 and Xone 42 1 2016-06-17.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Technics SL-1200]] turntables set up for DJ use. A [[DJ mixer]] is placed between the two turntables.]]
DJ [[turntablism]] has origins in the invention of [[direct-drive turntable]]s. Early [[belt-drive turntable]]s were unsuitable for turntablism and mixing, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage,<ref name="medium">Brian Coleman, [https://medium.com/@briancoleman/the-technics-1200-hammer-of-the-gods-xxl-fall-1998-5b93180a67da The Technics 1200 â€” Hammer Of The Gods], [[Medium (website)|Medium]]</ref> as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LApZ8KV7bZAC&pg=PA43 ''The World of DJs and the Turntable Culture'', page 43], [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 2003</ref> The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] (now [[Panasonic]]),<ref>''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 21 May 1977, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XCMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT140 page 140]</ref> based in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]].<ref name="medium"/> It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests.<ref name="oxford">Trevor Pinch, Karin Bijsterveld, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&pg=PA515 ''The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies'', page 515], [[Oxford University Press]]</ref> In 1969, Matsushita released it as the [[Technics (brand)|SP-10]],<ref name="oxford"/> the first direct-drive turntable on the market,<ref name="reverb">{{cite web|title=History of the Record Player Part II: The Rise and Fall|url=https://reverb.com/news/history-of-the-record-player-part-ii-the-rise-and-fall|website=[[Reverb.com]]|accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref> and the first in their influential [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] series of turntables.<ref name="oxford"/>

In 1972, Technics started making their [[Technics SL-1200|SL-1200 turntable]], which became the most popular turntable for DJs due to its high torque [[direct-drive turntable|direct drive]] design.<ref name="wired">[https://www.wired.com/2002/05/blackbox/ Six Machines That Changed The Music World], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', May 2002</ref> The SL-1200 had a rapid start and its durable direct drive enabled DJs to manipulate the platter, as with scratching techniques. [[Hip hop]] DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]] and [[beat juggling]] rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by [[DJ Kool Herc]], [[Grand Wizard Theodore]], and [[Afrika Bambaataa]], as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.<ref name="wired"/> Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.

In 1980, Japanese company [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] released the [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]], an analog [[Drum machine|rhythm/drum machine]], which has unique artificial sounds, such as its booming [[Bass drum|bass]] and sharp [[Snare drum|snare]], and a [[metronome]]-like [[rhythm]]. [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s use of the instrument in 1980 influenced hip hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa, after which the TR-808 would be widely adopted by hip hop DJs, with 808 sounds remaining central to hip hop music ever since.<ref name="kulkarni">Neil Kulkarni (2015), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ysyiCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA44 ''The Periodic Table of HIP HOP'', page 44], [[Random House]]</ref><ref name="808film">[[808 (film)|''808'' (documentary film)]]</ref> The [[Roland TB-303]], a [[bass synthesizer]] released in 1981, had a similar impact on [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[techno]] and [[house music]],<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|last=Vine|first=Richard|title=Tadao Kikumoto invents the Roland TB-303|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/tadao-kikumoto-roland|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=15 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="kulkarni"/> along with Roland's TR-808<ref name="808film"/> and [[TR-909]] drum machines.<ref name="complex">[http://complex.com/music/2014/09/roland-tr-909-tracks/ Complex.com]</ref><ref name="mixmag">[http://mixmag.net/feature/909-tracks-using-the-tr-909 Mixmag]</ref>

In 1982, the [[Compact Disc]] (CD) format was released, popularizing [[digital audio]]. In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. Final Scratch debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take sometime for this novel concept to catch on with the "die hard Vinyl DJs", This would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the "CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.

In 2001, [[Pioneer DJ]] began producing the [[CDJ#CDJ-1000|CDJ-1000]] [[CD player]], making the use of digital music recordings with traditional DJ techniques practical for the first time. As the 2000s progressed, [[laptop]] computers became more powerful and affordable. [[#Software|DJ software]], specialized DJ [[sound card]]s, and [[DJ controller]]s were developed for DJs to use laptops as a source of music rather than turntables or CDJs. In the 2010s, like laptops before them, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became more powerful & affordable. DJ software was written to run on these more portable devices instead of laptops, although laptops remain the more common type of computer for DJing.

== Women DJs ==
[[File:FemaleDJ.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A DJ mixing two record players at a live event.]]
In Western [[popular music]], [[Women in music|women musicians]] have achieved great success in singing and songwriting roles, however, there are relatively few women DJs or turntablists. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs. A 2013 ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' article stated that there are "...few women in [[Music producer|record production]] and [[sound engineering]]."<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}</ref> Ncube states that "[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male, and although there are female producers achieving great things in music, they are less well-known than their male counterparts."<ref name="ReferenceB"/>  The vast majority of students in music technology programs are male. In [[hip hop music]], the low percentage of women DJs and turntablists may stem from the overall male domination of the entire hip hop music industry. Most of the top rappers, MCs, DJs, record producers and music executives are men. There are a small number of high-profile women, but they are rare. 
[[File:Dj Virgin .jpg|thumb|left|DJ Virgin is a London, UK-based DJ. She is pictured mixing with a Pioneer DJ Controller, which can replicate the sound of vinyl record players.]]
In 2007 Mark Katz's article "Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle," stated that "very few women [do turntablism] battle[s]; the matter has been a topic of conversation among hip-hop DJs for years."<ref name="gender">{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Mark|date=12 December 2007|title=Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle|url=https://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/580.full#fn-9|journal=The Musical Quarterly|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdm007|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states "the male-centricity of EDM culture" contributes to "a marginalisation of women in these [EDM] spaces." <ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Dance Floor: Female DJs, Technology and Electronic Dance Music Culture|last=Farrugia|first=Rebekah|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1841505664|location=|pages=}}</ref> While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as "male [[technophilia]]."<ref name="gender" /> Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology. She explains: "an exclusive focus on women's supposed failure to enter the field â€¦ is insufficient for understanding how our stereotypical notions have come into being; it tends to put the burden of proof entirely on women and to blame them for their supposedly inadequate socialization, their lack of aspiration, and their want of masculine values.
