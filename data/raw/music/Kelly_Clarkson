'''Kelly Brianne Clarkson''' (born April 24, 1982) is an American singer-songwriter and television personality. She rose to fame in 2002 after winning the [[American Idol (season 1)|inaugural season]] of the television series ''[[American Idol]]'', which earned her a [[record deal]] with [[RCA Records]]. Clarkson's debut single, "[[A Moment Like This]]", topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and became the [[List of best-selling singles in the United States#Best-selling single by year|country's best-selling single of 2002]]. It was followed by the release of her debut album, ''[[Thankful (Kelly Clarkson album)|Thankful]]'' (2003), which debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Trying to reinvent her image, Clarkson decided to part ways with ''Idol'' management and shifted to [[pop rock]] music for her second album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]'' (2004). Fueled by [[Mainstream Top 40|top 40 radio]] number-one singles such as "[[Since U Been Gone]]" and "[[Because of You (Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]", the album sold over 12 million copies worldwide and earned Clarkson two [[Grammy Awards]].

She took further creative control for her third album, ''[[My December]]'' (2007), by becoming the executive producer and co-writing the entire album. However, her label was dissatisfied with her darker [[rock music]] and reluctantly promoted the album. Clarkson returned to the top of the charts with her more mainstream-oriented fourth album, ''[[All I Ever Wanted (album)|All I Ever Wanted]]'' (2009). Its lead single, "[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]", holds the record for the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Biggest jump to number one|biggest jump to number one]] on the Hot 100 chart. Her fifth studio album, ''[[Stronger (Kelly Clarkson album)|Stronger]]'' (2011), made Clarkson the first artist to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]] twice. It spawned her third Hot 100 number-one single "[[Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)]]". She became the first American female artist to achieve the [[List of best-selling Christmas/holiday albums in the United States|best-selling holiday album of the year]] with ''[[Wrapped in Red]]'' (2013). Following the release of her third number-one album ''[[Piece by Piece (Kelly Clarkson album)|Piece by Piece]]'' (2015), Clarkson concluded her contract with RCA Records and signed with [[Atlantic Records]] in 2016. Her [[soul music|soul]]-influenced eighth album, ''[[Meaning of Life (album)|Meaning of Life]]'' (2017), hit number two on the ''Billboard'' 200 and garnered her a record fifth Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album.

Clarkson has sold over 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide. She also scored a total of over 100 number ones on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]. Her accolades include three [[Grammy Award]]s, three [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, four [[American Music Award]]s, and two [[Academy of Country Music Awards]]. ''Billboard'' hailed Clarkson as "one of pop music's greatest singers"<ref name="greatest"/> and honored her with the [[Billboard Women in Music|Powerhouse Award]] for her vocals. Known as a versatile singer, Clarkson became the first artist in history to top each of ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Pop Songs|pop]], [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|adult contemporary]], [[Adult Top 40|adult pop]], [[Country music|country]] and [[Dance Club Songs|dance]] charts. She was ranked nineteenth on [[VH1]]'s list of [[The Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest Women in Music]]. Clarkson has also ventured into film, television, and writing children's books. She currently serves as a coach on the television competition series ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' and will host her [[The Kelly Clarkson Show|self-titled variety talk show]] in 2019.

Clarkson was educated at Pauline Hughes Middle School and in the seventh grade, the school's choir teacher, Cynthia Glenn, overheard her singing in a hallway and asked her to audition for the school choir.

You've got to sing. You're destined to sing." Clarkson continued singing and soon started classical training, hoping that music would be her ticket to a college scholarship. Upon graduating from high school, Clarkson was offered full scholarships to [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[University of North Texas]], and [[Berklee College of Music]], but later declined them, explaining: "I've already written so much music and wanted to try a career on my own" adding, "you're never too old to go to college."<ref name="MTV Romania" />

After graduation, Clarkson worked several jobs to finance a demo, recording material and trying to market it to record labels, but received little response. Clarkson turned down two recording contracts from [[Jive Records]] and [[Interscope Records]], stating "They would have completely pigeonholed me as a bubblegum act.<ref name="FOX News Biography" /> I was confident enough that something better would come along."<ref name="People 1" /> In 2001, she traveled to Los Angeles, trying to pursue a career in music.

Upon returning to Burleson, Clarkson was encouraged by her friends to audition for the inaugural season of the reality television series ''[[American Idol|American Idol: The Search for a Superstar]]'' in May 2002. Despite receiving a "golden ticket," a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode. In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred the inaugural season as "ghetto", explaining: "On our season we were like kids in camp. Nobody knew what to do. The show was ever-changing every day. They did one season of ''[[Pop Idol]]'' in the UK but America is a very different market. They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television'. I am maybe the closest to white trash you can get. What do I buy? White pants I guess?

Immediately after winning ''American Idol'', Clarkson was signed to a record deal with [[RCA Records]], [[19 Recordings]], and [[S Records]] by talent manager [[Simon Fuller]], who created ''American Idol''; and music mogul [[Clive Davis]], who was slated to executive-produce her debut album. On September 17, 2002, her debut double-A-side single, "[[Before Your Love]]"/"[[A Moment Like This]]", was released. Both songs were performed by Clarkson during the season finale of ''American Idol''. After debuting at number 60 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart, the single climbed to number 52 the following week, and subsequently ascended to number one. It broke a 38-year-old record set by the British band [[The Beatles]] for the biggest leap to number one.<ref name="CBS News article">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/16/earlyshow/leisure/music/main636364.shtml |title=Kelly Clarkson: Breakaway |first=Rome |last=Neal |work=[[CBS News]] |publisher=[[CBS Corporation]] |date=August 16, 2004 |accessdate=June 29, 2012 }}</ref> It eventually went on to become the [[List of best-selling singles in the United States#Best-selling single by year|best-selling single of 2002]] in the United States.<ref name="Best-selling 2002">{{cite news|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-extra-20-years-of-top-songs.html |title=Chart Watch Extra: 20 Years Of Top Songs |first=Paul |last=Green |work=Chart Watch |publisher=[[Yahoo Music]] |date=May 6, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005162354/http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-extra-20-years-of-top-songs.html |archivedate=October 5, 2012 }}</ref>

[[File:Kelly Clarkson in Canberra, 2005 (3).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Clarkson during her Hazel Eyes concert tour on November 15, 2005, [[Canberra]], Australia]]
Trying to distance herself from her ''American Idol'' image, Clarkson decided to part ways with Fuller and [[19 Entertainment|19 Management]] and hired the services of talent manager [[Jeff Kwatinetz]] of [[The Firm, Inc.|The Firm]]. She reinvented her musical direction by developing a more rock-oriented sound with her second studio album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]''.

Jon Lisi from ''[[PopMatters]]'' cited Clarkson as one of the forces of female domination in pop music of the 2000s. He explained that "Clarkson's anti-sexual image appealed to those who were uncomfortable with [[Britney Spears]]' overt exhibitionism. When Clarkson performed "Since U Been Gone" at the [[2005 MTV Video Music Awards]], for instance, she only showed her midriff, and it was clear that she was marketing herself to an alternative group of young females that liked pop music's conventional sound but didn't want to be confronted with sexual imagery."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/185488-how-women-dominated-pop-music-in-the-00s/ |title=How Women Dominated Pop Music in the '00s|website=Popmatters.com|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}</ref> Singer [[Demi Lovato]], who cited Clarkson as her musical inspiration, said that "[Clarkson] stays out of the tabloids.
