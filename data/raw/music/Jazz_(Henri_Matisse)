[[Henri Matisse]]’s '''''Jazz''''' is a limited-edition [[art book]] containing prints of colorful cut-[[paper]] [[Collage|collages]], accompanied by the artist's written thoughts. It was first issued on September 30, 1947, by art publisher [[Tériade]]. The portfolio, characterized by vibrant colors, poetic texts, and circus and theater themes, marks Matisse's transition to a new form of medium.<ref>{{cite book| last =Matisse | first =Henri | title =Jazz | publisher =Prestel Publishing | date =2001 | location =New York | pages =9 | isbn =379132392X }}</ref>

==Original creation==
Diagnosed with [[abdominal cancer]] in 1941, Matisse underwent surgery that left him chair- and bedbound. Limited in mobility, he could no longer paint or sculpt. Instead, he cut forms from colored paper that he arranged as [[collage]]s, and [[decoupage]] which became known as the “cut-outs”.<ref>{{Citation

That same year, at the age of 74, Matisse began ''Jazz''. His assistants helped prepare the collages for printing, using a stencil process known as ''[[pochoir]]'' in French. He worked on the series for two years, utilizing this new method that linked drawing and color—two important elements in Matisse's work.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | title = Henri Matisse’s Joyful, Poetic Works Created in the Midst of War | publisher = Cantor Arts Center | date = | year = | url = http://museum.stanford.edu/news_room/matisse-jazz.html | accessdate = April 6, 2015}}</ref>

The designs were initially intended as covers for ''[[Verve (French magazine)|Verve]]'', a French art magazine published by [[Tériade]]. In 1947, Tériade issued the compositions in an artist's portfolio. The book included 20 color prints, each about {{convert|16|by|26|in|cm}}, as well as Matisse's handwritten notes expressing his thoughts throughout the process. Tériade gave it the title ''Jazz'', which Matisse liked because it suggested a connection between art and [[Jazz improvisation|musical improvisation]]. Despite the low number of books printed, ''Jazz'' was well received.<ref>{{Citation| last = | first = | author-link = | title = Henri Matisse’s Joyful, Poetic Works Created in the Midst of War | publisher = Cantor Arts Center | date = | year = | url = http://museum.stanford.edu/news_room/matisse-jazz.html | accessdate = April 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Matisse | first =Henri | title =Jazz | publisher =Prestel Publishing | date =2001 | location =New York | pages =9 | isbn =379132392X }}</ref>

The [[circus]], the title originally suggested for the book, provided inspiration for the majority of the motifs concerning performing artists and [[Balancing Acts|balancing acts]]. “These images, with their lively and violent tones, derive from crystallizations of memories of circuses, folktales, and voyages,” Matisse explains in the accompanying text.<ref>{{cite book| last =Matisse | first =Henri | title =Jazz | publisher =Prestel Publishing | date =2001 | location =New York | pages =13 | isbn =379132392X }}</ref> The figure of the circus artist, usually depicted alone, is often seen as a metaphor for the artist himself.

The first prints illustrating the circus do not seem to have an immediate connection to the succeeding works. However, these compositions are viewed as metaphors of life. The overall themes in ''Jazz'' derive from biographical elements, such as Matisse's recollection of his travels to [[Tahiti]] in the three "Lagoon" sheets (XVII–XIX), as well as broader aspects including love (V, VI), death (X), and fate (XVI).<ref>{{cite book| last1 =Berggruen | last2 = Hollein | first1 =Olivier| first2 =Max| title =Henri Matisse: Drawing with Scissors: Masterpieces from the Late Years | publisher =Prestel Publishing | date =2006 | location =New York | pages =23 | isbn =9783791334738 }}</ref>
