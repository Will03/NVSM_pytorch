'''Australia''' has participated in the '''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]''' four times since their debut at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015 contest]] in [[Vienna]]. The country's best result in the contest is a second-place finish for [[Dami Im]] in {{escyr|2016}}. Australia also finished in the top ten in two of its other appearances in the contest, with [[Guy Sebastian]] finishing fifth in 2015, and [[Isaiah Firebrace]] finishing ninth in {{escyr|2017}}.

Australia's participation in the 2015 contest was set to be a one-off event, the plan being only to perform again the following year had they won, but it was confirmed in November 2015 by [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] that they would participate in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 contest]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Australien är klar för Eurovision Song Contest 2016 i Stockholm|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/australien-ar-klar-for-eurovision-song-contest-2016-i-stockholm|publisher=Sveriges Television|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref> Australia is the first country from the [[Oceania]] region (and the second country outside Eurasia, after [[Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Morocco]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]]) to participate in the contest.

==History==

===1983–2014===
Australian broadcaster [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) first broadcast the Eurovision Song Contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]] and has continued to do so every year since. The contest has attracted a strong viewing audience in Australia, primarily because a significant proportion of the population have ancestry in Europe (in particular in the [[Australia–United Kingdom relations|United Kingdom]]). Early broadcasts of the Contest in Australia either featured no commentary or used the {{Esccnty|United Kingdom}}'s commentary as transmitted by the [[BBC]]. In {{ESCYr|2001}}, actress and comedian [[Mary Coustas]] provided commentary for the Contest performing as her comedic character [[Effie Stephanidis|Effie]].<ref name="escinsight.com"/> In {{ESCYr|2002}} and {{ESCYr|2003}}, SBS presenter Des Mangan provided commentary for the Australian audience. From {{ESCYr|2009}}, [[Julia Zemiro]] and [[Sam Pang]] were assigned as commentators for the competition by SBS.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nicholson |first=Sarah |title=Top of the Euro pops |work=Courier Mail |publisher=news.com.au |date=2008-05-21 |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23729009-5003422,00.html |accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref><ref name="Australia 2">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/04/airdate-eurovision-2009.html |title=Airdate: Eurovision 2009 |last=Knox |first=David |date=2009-04-16 |publisher=''TV Tonight'' |accessdate=2009-04-16}}</ref> {{ESCYr|2017}} saw SBS replace the commentators with comedian [[Joel Creasey]] and TV and radio personality [[Myf Warhurst]]. In addition to broadcasting the contest, SBS has also broadcast the [[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest|50th]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits|60th]] anniversary programmes.

From 2010 to 2014, SBS allowed Australian viewers to participate in their own televote for the Grand Finals.<ref name="eurovision.tv">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=australian_televoters_choose_their_winner|title=Australian televoters choose their winner|work=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> However, these votes were not counted at the actual contest and did not affect the overall result. The SBS commentary team and Australian delegation were awarded a commentary booth of their own at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012 contest]] in [[Baku]]. They have been allocated a commentary booth every year since.

In the event that Australia should win the Eurovision Song Contest, the EBU had confirmed that in accordance with the rules, Australia would not host the event in the southern hemisphere, and instead would co-host the contest within a country in the EBU.<ref name="Oz-Win">{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=What happens if Australia wins the Eurovision Song Contest?|url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/05/13/happens-australia-wins-eurovision-song-contest/|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=13 May 2017|date=13 May 2017}}</ref> Further to the EBU's statement it was confirmed that {{Esccnty|Germany}} and their broadcaster [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR)]] would be the first choice, and {{Esccnty|United Kingdom}}'s broadcaster [[British Broadcasting Corporation|British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)]] being the back-up hosts should Germany decline.<ref name="Oz-Win"/>

===2015 debut===
{{main|Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015}}
SBS made the country's debut at the 2015 Contest with the song "[[Tonight Again]]" a song written and performed by [[Guy Sebastian]]. Although Australia is outside the [[European Broadcasting Area]], the [[European Broadcasting Union]] and Austrian host broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] decided to permit an Australian entry to commemorate the 60th Contest. The special circumstances surrounding Australia's entry and "to not reduce the chances" of the semi-final participants led the organisers to allow Australia to compete directly in the grand final without pre-qualification.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australia participate in the 60th Eurovision|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=australia_to_participate_in_the_2015_eurovision_song_contest|publisher=EBU|website=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=11 February 2015|date=10 February 2015}}</ref> The 2015 Australian jury consisted of [[Amanda Pelman]] (Chair), [[Richard Wilkins (TV presenter)|Richard Wilkins]], [[Danielle Spencer (Australian actress)|Danielle Spencer]] and [[Jake Stone (singer)|Jake Stone]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Australian Eurovision Jury|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/programs/eurovision/rate-and-vote/australian-eurovision-jury|website=SBS Eurovision|publisher=SBS|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=1 May 2015}}</ref>
