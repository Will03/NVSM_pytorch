The instrument consists of a [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] and a separate [[amplifier]] and [[loudspeaker|speaker]] unit. The keyboard usually covered three octaves,<ref name=PowerhouseMuseum /> and had a number of switches to alter the tone of the sound produced, add [[vibrato]] (a defining feature of the instrument),<ref name="SOS_March07" /> and provide other effects. The Clavioline used a [[vacuum tube]] oscillator to produce a buzzy waveform, almost a square wave, which could then be altered using [[high-pass filter|high-pass]] and [[low-pass filter|low-pass]] [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]], as well as the vibrato. The amplifier also aided in creating the instrument's signature tones, by deliberately providing a large amount of distortion.<ref name="SOS_March07" />

Several models of the Clavioline were produced by different companies. Among the more important were the Standard, Reverb, and Concert models by [[Henri Selmer Paris|Selmer]] in France<ref name=PowerhouseMuseum>

==Recordings==
The Clavioline has been used on a number of recordings in [[popular music]] as well as in film. Along with the [[Mellotron]], it was one of the keyboard instruments favoured by rock and pop musicians during the 1960s before the arrival of the [[Moog synthesizer]].{{sfn|Holmes|2012|pp=xviii, 448}}
