A '''radio personality''' (American English) or '''radio presenter''' (British English) is a person who has an on-air position in [[radio broadcasting]]. A radio personality who hosts a [[radio show]] is also known as a '''radio host''', and in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] as a '''radio jockey'''. Radio personalities who introduce and play individual selections of recorded music are known as [[disc jockey]]s or "DJs" for short. Broadcast radio personalities may include [[talk radio]] hosts, AM/FM radio show hosts, and [[satellite radio]] program hosts.

==Description==
A radio personality can be someone who introduces and discusses genres of music; hosts a [[talk radio]] show that may take calls from listeners; interviews celebrities or guests; or gives news, weather, sports, or traffic information. The radio personality may broadcast live or use [[voice-tracking]] techniques.<ref>L. A. Heberlein - The Rough Guide to Internet Radio 2002 - Page v. "In addition to putting songs together, a good radio host can tell you things you didn't know about the artists, the songs, and the times."</ref> Increasingly in the 2010s, radio personalities are expected to supplement their on-air work by posting information online, such as on a blog or on another web forum. This may be either to generate additional revenue or connect with listeners.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rooke |first1=Barry |last2=Odame |first2=Helen Hambly |title="I Have to Blog a Blog Too?"

==History==

{{main article|Radio disc jockey history}}
In the past, the term "[[disc jockey]]" (or "DJ") was exclusively used to describe on-air radio personalities who played recorded music and hosted radio shows that featured popular music.

Although radio personalities who specialized in news or talk programs such as [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] and [[Walter Winchell]] existed since the early days of radio, exclusive talk radio formats emerged and multiplied in the 1960s, as telephone call in shows, interviews, news, and public affairs became more popular. In New York, [[WINS (AM)]] switched to a talk format in 1965, and [[WCBS (AM)]] followed two years later. Early talk radio personalities included [[Bruce Williams (talk radio host)|Bruce Williams]] and [[Sally Jesse Raphael]].<ref name="Cox2009">{{cite book|author=Jim Cox|title=American Radio Networks: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpxGeViyuPwC|date=26 October 2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5424-2}}</ref> The growth of sports talk radio began in the 1960s, and resulted in the first all-sports station in the US, [[WFAN (AM)]] that would go on to feature many sports radio personalities such as [[Marv Albert]] and [[Howie Rose]].
