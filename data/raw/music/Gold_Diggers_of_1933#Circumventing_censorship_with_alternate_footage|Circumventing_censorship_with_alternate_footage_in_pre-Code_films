'''''Gold Diggers of 1933''''' is a [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] [[Warner Bros.]] [[musical film]] directed by [[Mervyn LeRoy]] with songs by [[Harry Warren]] (music) and [[Al Dubin]] (lyrics), staged and choreographed by [[Busby Berkeley]].  It stars [[Warren William]], [[Joan Blondell]], [[Aline MacMahon]], [[Ruby Keeler]], and [[Dick Powell]], and features [[Guy Kibbee]], [[Ned Sparks]] and [[Ginger Rogers]].

The story is based on the play ''The Gold Diggers'' by [[Avery Hopwood]], which ran for 282 performances on Broadway in 1919 and 1920.<ref>IBDB [http://ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=6692 "The Gold Diggers"]</ref>  The play was made into a silent film in 1923 by [[David Belasco]], the producer of the Broadway play, as ''[[The Gold Diggers (1923 film)|The Gold Diggers]]'', starring [[Hope Hampton]] and [[Wyndham Standing]], and again as a talkie in 1929, directed by [[Roy Del Ruth]]. That film, ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'', which starred [[Nancy Welford]] and [[Conway Tearle]], was the biggest box office hit of that year, and ''Gold Diggers of 1933'' was one of the top-grossing films of 1933.<ref name=tcmnotes>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=3463&category=Notes Notes]</ref>  This version of Hopwood's play was written by James Seymour and Erwin S. Gelsey, with additional dialogue by [[David Boehm]] and Ben Markson.

In 2003, ''Gold Diggers of 1933'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
[[File:PollyBradGoldDigs1933Trailer crop.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ruby Keeler]] and [[Dick Powell]]]]

The "gold diggers" are four aspiring actresses: Polly ([[Ruby Keeler]]), an [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]]; Carol ([[Joan Blondell]]), a [[Torch song|torch singer]]; Trixie ([[Aline MacMahon]]), a comedian; and Fay ([[Ginger Rogers]]), a glamour puss.

The film was made in 1933, during the [[Great Depression]] and contains numerous direct references to it. It begins with a rehearsal for a stage show, which is interrupted by the producer's [[creditor]]s who close down the show because of unpaid bills.

At the unglamorous apartment shared by three of the four actresses (Polly, Carol, and Trixie), the producer, Barney Hopkins ([[Ned Sparks]]), is in despair because he has everything he needs to put on a show, except money. He hears Brad Roberts ([[Dick Powell]]), the girls' neighbor and Polly's boyfriend, playing the piano. Brad is a brilliant songwriter and singer who not only has written the music for a show, but also offers Hopkins $15,000 in cash to back the production. Of course, they all think he is kidding, but he insists that he is serious &ndash; he offers to back the show, but refuses to perform in it, despite his talent and voice.

Brad comes through with the money and the show goes into production, but the girls are suspicious that he must be a criminal since he is cagey about his past and will not appear in the show, even though he is clearly more talented than the aging juvenile lead (Clarence Nordstrom) they have hired. It turns out, however, that Brad is in fact a millionaire's son whose family does not want him associating with the theatre. On opening night, in order to save the show when the juvenile cannot perform (due to his [[lumbago]] acting up), Brad is forced to play the lead role.

With the resulting publicity, Brad's brother J. Lawrence Bradford ([[Warren William]]) and family lawyer Fanuel H. Peabody ([[Guy Kibbee]]) discover what he is doing and go to New York to save him from being seduced by a "gold digger".

Lawrence mistakes Carol for Polly, and his heavy-handed effort to dissuade the "cheap and vulgar" showgirl from marrying Brad by buying her off annoys her so much that she plays along, but the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Trixie targets "Fanny" the lawyer as the perfect rich sap ripe for exploitation. When Lawrence finds out that Brad and Polly have wed, he threatens to have the marriage annulled, but relents when Carol refuses to marry him if he does. Trixie marries Fanuel. All the "gold diggers" (except Fay) end up with wealthy men.

==Musical numbers==

The film contains four song and dance sequences designed, staged and choreographed by Busby Berkeley.  All the songs were written by Harry Warren and Al Dubin.<ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=3463&category=Music Music]</ref>  (In the film, when producer Barney Hopkins hears Brad's music he picks up the phone and says: "Cancel my contract with Warren and Dubin!")

"[[We're in the Money]]" is sung by Ginger Rogers accompanied by scantily-clad showgirls dancing with giant coins. Rogers sings one verse in [[Pig Latin]].

"[[Pettin' in the Park]]" is sung by Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell. It includes a [[tap dance]] from Keeler and a surreal sequence featuring [[dwarfism|dwarf]] actor Billy Barty as a baby who escapes from his stroller.  During the number, the women get caught in a rainstorm and go behind a backlit screen to remove their wet clothes in silhouette. They emerge in metal garments, which thwart the men's attempts to remove them, until Billy Barty gives Dick Powell a can opener.  This number was originally planned to end the film.<ref name=tcmarticle />

"The Shadow Waltz" is sung by Powell and Keeler. It features a dance by Keeler, Rogers, and many female violinists with neon-tubed violins that glow in the dark.  Berkeley got the idea for this number from a vaudeville act he once saw - the neon on the violins was an afterthought. On March 10, the [[Long Beach earthquake of 1933|Long Beach earthquake]] hit while this number was being filmed:

<blockquote>[it] caused a blackout and short-circuited some of the dancing violins. Berkeley was almost thrown from the camera boom, dangling by one hand until he could pull himself back up. He yelled for the girls, many of whom were on a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}}-high platform, to sit down until technicians could get the soundstage doors open and let in some light.<ref name=tcmarticle>Frank Miller [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=3463&category=Articles "Gold Diggers of 1933" TCM article]</ref></blockquote>

"Remember My Forgotten Man" is performed by Joan Blondell, with featured vocal solo by [[Etta Moten]] &ndash; who also dubbed Blondell's singing voice at the end of the number<ref name=afi>{{AFI film|3947}}</ref> &ndash; and features sets influenced by [[German Expressionism]] and a gritty evocation of Depression-era poverty. Berkeley was inspired by the May [[Bonus Army|1932 war veterans' march]] on Washington, D.C.  When the number was finished, [[Jack L. Warner]] and [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] (the studio production head) were so impressed that they ordered it moved to the end of the film, displacing "Pettin' in the Park".<ref name=tcmarticle />

An additional production number was filmed, but cut before release: "I've Got to Sing a Torch Song" was to have been sung by Ginger Rogers, but instead appears in the film sung by Dick Powell near the beginning.<ref name=tcmarticle /><ref>According to the book ''Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood'' by Mark Vieira, Ginger Rogers' rendition of "I've Got to Sing a Torch Song" was cut before release simply because it slowed down the film. A still of Rogers, sitting atop a piano performing it, survives today and is shown in the book.</ref>

==Circumventing censorship with alternate footage==
According to ''Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood'' by Mark A. Vieira, ''Gold Diggers of 1933'' was one of the first American films made and distributed with alternative footage in order to circumvent [[Film censorship in the United States|state censorship]] problems. [[Busby Berkeley]] used lavish production numbers as a showcase of the female anatomy that were both "lyrical and lewd".<ref name="Sin">{{cite book |last1=Vieira |first1=Mark A. |title=Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood |year=1999 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|location=New York |isbn=978-0-8109-4475-6 |page=117}}</ref> "Pettin' in the Park" and "We're in the Money" are prime examples of this. The state censorship boards had become so troublesome that a number of studios began filming slightly different versions of censorable scenes. In this way, when a film was edited, the "toned down" reels were labeled according to district. One version could be sent to [[New York City]], another to the [[Southern United States|South]], and another to the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="Sin" />

Vieira reports that the film had two different endings: in one, the rocky romance between [[Warren William]] and [[Joan Blondell]] &ndash; whom he calls "cheap and vulgar" &ndash; is resolved backstage after the "Forgotten Man" number. In an alternative ending, this scene never takes place and the film ends with the number.<ref name="Sin" />
