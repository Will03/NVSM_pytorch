{{Culture of Australia}}
The '''culture of Australia''' is primarily a [[Western culture]], to some extent derived from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] but also influenced by the unique geography of [[Australia]], the cultural input of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]], [[Torres Strait Islander]] and other [[Australian]] people. The [[British colonization of Australia]] began in 1788, and waves of multi-ethnic migration followed. Evidence of a significant [[Anglo-Celtic]] heritage includes the predominance of the [[English language]], the existence of a [[democratic system]] of government drawing upon the British traditions of [[Westminster]] Government, Parliamentarianism and [[Monarchy of Australia|constitutional monarchy]], American [[constitutionalism|constitutionalist]] and [[federalism|federalist]] traditions, [[Christianity]] as the dominant religion, and the popularity of sports originating in (or influenced by) the British Isles.  Australian culture has diverged significantly since British settlement.

Aboriginal people are believed to have arrived as early as 60,000 years ago, and evidence of [[Aboriginal art]] in Australia dates back at least 30,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/Indigenous_peoples.html |title=About Australia: Indigenous peoples: an overview |publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122064834/http://dfat.gov.au/facts/Indigenous_peoples.html |archivedate=22 November 2010 }}</ref> Several [[States and Territories of Australia|states and territories]] had their origins as penal colonies, with the [[First Fleet|first British convicts]] arriving at [[Sydney Cove]] in 1788. Stories of outlaws like the bushranger [[Ned Kelly]] have endured in [[Australian music]], [[Australian|cinema]] and [[Australian literature|literature]]. The [[Australian gold rushes]] from the 1850s brought wealth as well as new social tensions to Australia, including the miners' [[Eureka Stockade]] rebellion. The colonies established elected parliaments and rights for workers and women before most other Western nations.<ref name="ReferenceB">Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books; 2004; {{ISBN|978-0-14-300559-9}}</ref>

[[Australian Federation|Federation]] in 1901 evidenced a growing sense of national identity that had developed over the latter half of the 19th century, as seen in the works of the [[Heidelberg School]] painters and writers like [[Banjo Paterson]], [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Dorothea Mackellar]]. The World Wars profoundly altered Australia's sense of identity, with [[World War I]] introducing the [[ANZAC]] legend, and [[World War II]] seeing a reorientation from Britain to the [[United States]] as the nation's foremost [[ANZUS|major ally]].  After the second war, 6.5 million migrants from 200 nations brought immense new diversity, and Australians at the time grew increasingly aware of their proximity to Asia. Over time, the diverse food, lifestyle and cultural practices of immigrants have been absorbed into mainstream Australian culture.<ref name="Reference">{{cite web|url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-country |title=About Australia: Our Country |publisher= australia.gov.au |accessdate=2013-10-25}}</ref><ref name="Referencea">{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/people_culture.html |title=About Australia: People, culture and lifestyle |publisher=Dfat.gov.au |accessdate=2013-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512195954/http://dfat.gov.au/facts/people_culture.html |archivedate=12 May 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>

The oldest surviving cultural traditions in Australia—and some of the oldest surviving cultural traditions on earth—are those of Australia's [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] peoples. Their ancestors have inhabited Australia for between 40,000 and 60,000 years, living a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle. In 2006, the Indigenous population was estimated at 517,000 people, or 2.5 per cent of the total population.<ref>{{cite book|title=Year Book Australia|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|year=2012|series=1301.0|chapter=Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1301.0~2012~Main%20Features~Aboriginal%20and%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20population~50|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref> Most Aboriginal Australians have a belief system based on the [[dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]], or Dreamtime, which refers both to a time when ancestral spirits created land and culture, and to the knowledge and practices that define individual and community responsibilities and identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Indigenous-Australia-Spirituality|title=Indigenous Australians – Spirituality|year=2009|publisher=Australian Museum|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref> Conflict and reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians has been a source of much art and literature in Australia, and ancient [[Aboriginal art]]istic styles and iconic inventions such as the [[boomerang]], the [[didgeridoo]] and [[Indigenous Australian music]] have become symbols of modern Australia.

The arrival of the [[First Fleet|first British settlers]] at what is now Sydney in 1788 introduced [[Western civilisation]] to the Australian continent. Although Sydney was initially used by the British as a place of banishment for prisoners, the arrival of the British laid the foundations for Australia's democratic institutions and rule of law, and introduced the long traditions of [[English literature]], [[Western art]] and music, and [[Judeo-Christian]] ethics and religious outlook to a new continent.

The [[British Empire]] expanded across the whole continent and established six colonies. The colonies were originally penal colonies, with the exception of Western Australia and [[South Australia]], which were established as a "free colony" with no convicts and a vision for a territory with political and religious freedoms, together with opportunities for wealth through business and pastoral investments.<ref>{{cite web

Though Western Australia became a penal colony after insufficient numbers of free settlers arrived. Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, grew from its status as a convict free region and experienced prosperity from the late nineteenth century.

Contact between the indigenous Australians and the new settlers ranged from cordiality to violent conflict, but the diseases brought by Europeans were devastating to Aboriginal populations and culture. According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], during the colonial period: "Smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another&nbsp;... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation."<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

[[William Wentworth]] established Australia's first political party in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]] for New South Wales. From the 1850s, the colonies set about writing constitutions which produced democratically advanced parliaments as [[Constitutional Monarchy|Constitutional Monarchies]] with [[Queen Victoria]] as the head of state.<ref>[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/righttovote.htm AEC.gov.au]</ref>

[[Women's suffrage in Australia]] was achieved from the 1890s.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/reform.htm AEC.gov.au]</ref>  Women became eligible to vote in South Australia in 1895. This was the first legislation in the world permitting women to stand for political office and, in 1897, [[Catherine Helen Spence]], an Adelaidean, became the first female political candidate.<ref name="aec.gov.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 Oct 2007 |accessdate=27 Jun 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Foundingdocs.gov.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203020826/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 |date=3 December 2010 }}</ref> Though constantly evolving, the key foundations for elected parliamentary government have maintained an historical continuity in Australia from the 1850s into the 21st century.

During the colonial era, distinctive forms of [[Australian art]], [[Australian music|music]], [[Australian English|language]] and [[Australian literature|literature]] developed through movements like the [[Heidelberg school]] of painters and the work of [[bush ballad]]eers like [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]], whose poetry and prose did much to promote an egalitarian Australian outlook which placed a high value on the concept of [[mateship]]. Games like [[cricket]] and [[rugby football|rugby]] were imported from Britain at this time and with a local variant of football, [[Australian Rules Football]], became treasured cultural traditions.

The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] was founded in 1901, after a series of referenda conducted in the British colonies of [[Australasia]]. The [[Australian Constitution]] established a federal democracy and enshrined [[human rights]] such as sections 41 (right to vote), 80 (right to trial by jury) and 116 (freedom of religion) as foundational principles of Australian law and included economic rights such as restricting the government to acquiring property only "on just terms".<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/1999/31.html Human Rights under the Australian Constitution by George Williams – [1999&#93; MULR 31; (1999) 23 Melbourne University Law Review 817]</ref> The [[Australian Labor Party]] was established in the 1890s and the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] in 1944, both rising to be the dominant political parties and rivals of [[Australian politics]], though various [[List of political parties in Australia|other parties]] have been and remain influential. Voting is compulsory in Australia and government is essentially formed by a group commanding a majority of seats in the [[Australian House of Representatives]] selecting a leader who becomes [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]. Australia remains a [[Monarchy in Australia|constitutional monarchy]] in which the largely ceremonial and procedural duties of the monarch are performed by a [[Governor General of Australia|Governor General]] selected by the Australian government.

Australia fought at Britain's side from the outset of [[World War One]] and [[World War Two]] and came under attack from the Empire of Japan during the latter conflict. These wars profoundly affected Australia's sense of nationhood and a proud military legend developed around the spirit of Australia's [[ANZAC]] troops, who came to symbolise the virtues of mateship, courage and endurance for the nation.

The Australian colonies had a period of extensive multi-ethnic immigration during the [[Australian gold rushes]] of the latter half of the 19th century, but following Federation in 1901, the Parliament instigated the [[White Australia Policy]] that gave preference to British migrants and ensured that Australia remained a predominantly Anglo-Celtic society until well into the 20th century. The post-[[World War II]] immigration program saw the policy dismantled by successive governments, permitting large numbers of Southern European, and later Asian and Middle Eastern migrants to arrive. The [[Menzies Government (1949-1966)]] and [[Holt Government]] dismantled the legal barriers to multi-ethnic immigration and by the 1970s, the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam]] and [[Fraser Government]]s were promoting [[multiculturalism]].<ref>[http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/08abolition.htm Australian Immigration Fact Sheet 8.

Some [[States and Territories of Australia]] retained discriminatory laws relating to voting rights for Aborigines into the 1960s, at which point full legal equality was established. A [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]] to include all Aborigines in the national electoral roll census was overwhelmingly approved by voters. In 1984, [[Pintupi Nine|a group of]] [[Pintupi]] people who were living a traditional [[hunter-gatherer]] desert-dwelling life were tracked down in the [[Gibson Desert]] and brought into a settlement. They are believed to have been the last [[uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://recollections.nma.gov.au/issues/vol_1_no_2/exhibition_reviews/colliding_worlds/ |title=Colliding worlds: first contact in the western desert, 1932–1984 |publisher=Recollections.nma.gov.au |accessdate=12 Oct 2009}}</ref>

While the British cultural influence remained strong into the 21st century, other influences became increasingly important. The Hawaiian sport of surfing was adopted in Australia where a beach culture and the locally developed [[surf lifesaving]] movement was already burgeoning in the early 20th century. American pop culture and cinema were embraced in the 20th century, with country music and later rock and roll sweeping Australia, aided by the new technology of television and a host of American content. The 1956 [[1956 Summer Olympics|Melbourne Olympics]] announced a confident, prosperous post-war nation, and new cultural icons like [[Australian country music]] star [[Slim Dusty]] and [[dadaist]] Barry Humphries expressed a uniquely Australian identity.

Australia's contemporary immigration program has two components: a program for skilled and family migrants and a humanitarian program for refugees and asylum seekers.<ref>[http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/60refugee.htm Australian Immigration Fact Sheet 60 – Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian Program]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5adoXSVqA?url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/60refugee.htm |date=6 September 2008 }}</ref> By 2010, the post-war immigration program had received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent.

Contemporary Australia is a pluralistic society, rooted in [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] traditions and espousing informality and egalitarianism as key societal values. While strongly influenced by [[Anglo-Celtic]] origins, the culture of Australia has also been shaped by multi-ethnic migration which has influenced all aspects of Australian life, including business, the arts, [[Australian cuisine|cuisine]], [[Australian comedy|sense of humour]] and sporting tastes.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Contemporary Australia is also a culture that is profoundly influenced by global movements of meaning and communication, including advertising culture. In turn, globalizing corporations from Holden to Exxon have attempted to associate their brand with Australian cultural identity. This process intensified from the 1970s onwards. According to [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]],

{{cquote|this consciously created interlock of the image of the multinational corporation with aspects of Australia’s national mythology, has itself over the last decade [the 1970s to 1980s] contributed to the maintenance and evolution of those national themes.

==Symbols==

[[File:Golden-wattle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Golden Wattle]], Australia's floral emblem and the source of Australia's national colours, [[green and gold]]]]
When the Australian colonies federated on 1 January 1901, an official competition for a design for an [[Flag of Australia|Australian flag]] was held. The design that was adopted contains the [[Union Jack|Union Flag]] in the left corner, symbolising Australia's historical links to the [[United Kingdom]], the stars of the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] on the right half of the flag indicating Australia's geographical location, and the seven-pointed Federation Star in the bottom left representing the six [[states and territories of Australia|states and the territories of Australia]]. Other official flags include<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/otherflag.cfm It's an Honour – Symbols – Other Australian Flags]</ref> the [[Australian Aboriginal Flag]], the [[Torres Strait Islander Flag]] and the flags of the individual states and territories.

The [[Coat of arms of Australia|Australian Coat of Arms]] was granted by [[George V|King George V]] in 1912 and consists of a shield containing the badges of the six states, within an ermine border. The crest above the shield and helmet is a seven-pointed gold star on a blue and gold wreath, representing the 6 states and the territories. The shield is supported by a [[red kangaroo]] and an [[emu]].

Green and gold were confirmed as [[National colours of Australia|Australia's national colours]] in 1984, though the colours had been adopted by many national sporting teams long before this.<ref>[http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/australia_national_symbols.html Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219181216/http://dfat.gov.au/facts/australia_national_symbols.html |date=19 February 2011 }}</ref> The [[Acacia pycnantha|Golden Wattle]] (''Acacia pycnantha'') was officially proclaimed as the national floral emblem in 1988.

Reflecting the country's status as a [[constitutional monarchy]], a number of royal symbols exist in Australia. These include symbols of the [[Monarchy in Australia|monarch of Australia]], as well as the monarch's [[Viceroy|Vice-regal]] representatives.

Despite the fact that the [[Queen of Australia]] is not resident in Australia, the Crown and royal institutions remain part of Australian life. The [[Australian dollar|Australian currency]], including all coins and the five dollar note, bears an image of the reigning monarch, [[Monarchy in Australia|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Around 12% of public lands in Australia are referred to as [[Crown land]], including reserves set aside for environmental conservation as well as vacant land.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} There are many geographic places that have been named in honour of a reigning monarch, including the states of [[Queensland]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], named after [[Queen Victoria]], with numerous rivers, streets, squares, parks and buildings carrying the names of past or present members of the Royal Family. Through royal [[patronage]] there are many [[List of Australian organisations with royal patronage|organisations in Australia]] that have been granted a ''Royal'' prefix. These organisations, including branches of the [[Australian Defence Force]], often incorporate royal symbols into their imagery.

Although Australia has no official language, it is largely [[monoglottism|monolingual]] with English being the de facto [[national language]]. [[Australian English]] is a major variety of the language which is immediately distinguishable from [[British English|British]], [[American English|American]], and other national dialects by virtue of its unique accents, pronunciations, idioms and vocabulary, although its spelling more closely reflects British versions rather than American. According to the 2011 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for around 80% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are Mandarin (1.7%), Italian (1.5%), and Arabic (1.4%); almost all migrants speak some English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2071.0main+features902012-2013|title=Reflecting a Nation: Stories from the 2011 Census, 2012–2013|date=21 June 2012|work=Catalogue item 2071.0|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref> Australia has a sign language known as [[Auslan]], which in 2004 was the main language of about 6,500 deaf people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asliansw.org.au/work.php|title=Working with interpreters|year=2014|publisher=Australian Sign Language Interpreters' Association of NSW|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>

It is believed that there were between 200 and 300 Australian Aboriginal languages at the time of first European contact, but only about 70 of these have survived and all but 20 are now endangered.

==Humour==
{{Main|Australian comedy}}
[[File:Dame Edna at the royal wedding cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dame Edna Everage]], a comic creation of [[Barry Humphries]]]]
Comedy is an important part of the Australian identity. The "Australian sense of humour" is often characterised as dry, irreverent and ironic, exemplified by the works of performing artists like Barry Humphries and [[Paul Hogan]].<ref name="australia.gov.au">[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-humour Australian humour – australia.gov.au]</ref>

The convicts of the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)|early colonial period]] helped establish anti-authoritarianism as a hallmark of Australian comedy. Influential in the establishment of stoic, dry wit as a characteristic of Australian humour were the [[bush ballad]]eers of the 19th century, including [[Henry Lawson]], author of "[[The Loaded Dog]]".<ref>[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/henry-lawson Henry Lawson: Australian writer – australia.gov.au]</ref> His contemporary, [[Banjo Paterson]], contributed a number of classic comic poems including ''[[The Man from Ironbark]]''  and ''[[The Geebung Polo Club]]''. [[CJ Dennis]] wrote humour in the Australian vernacular – notably in ''[[The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke]]''. The ''[[Dad and Dave]]'' series about a farming family was an enduring hit of the early 20th century. The [[World War I]] [[ANZAC]] troops were said to often display irreverence in their relations with superior officers and dark humour in the face of battle.<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/exhibitions/1918/soldier/superiors.asp Australians in France: 1918 – Friends and Foe – Australian soldiers' relations with their superiors &#124; Australian War Memorial]</ref>

Australian comedy has a strong tradition of self-mockery, from the outlandish [[Barry McKenzie]] ''expat-in-Europe'' [[ocker]] comedies of the 1970s, to the quirky outback characters of the ''[["Crocodile" Dundee]]'' films of the 1980s, the suburban parody of [[Working Dog Productions]]' 1997 film ''[[The Castle (1997 Australian film)|The Castle]]'' and the dysfunctional suburban mother–daughter sitcom ''[[Kath & Kim (Australian TV series)|Kath & Kim]]''. In the 1970s, satirical talk-show host [[Norman Gunston]] (played by Garry McDonald), with his [[malapropism]]s, sweep-over hair and poorly shaven face, rose to great popularity by pioneering the satirical "ambush" interview technique and giving unique interpretations of pop songs. [[Roy and HG]] provide an affectionate but irreverent parody of Australia's obsession with sport.

The unique character and humour of Australian culture was defined in cartoons by immigrants, [[Emile Mercier (cartoonist)|Emile Mercier]] and [[George Molnar]], and in the novel ''[[They're a Weird Mob]]'' (1957) by [[John O'Grady (writer)|John O'Grady]], which looks at Sydney through the eyes of an Italian immigrant.  Post-war immigration has seen migrant humour flourish through the works of Vietnamese refugee [[Anh Do]], Egyptian-Australian stand-up comic [[Akmal Saleh]]  and Greek-Australian actor [[Nick Giannopoulos]].

Since the 1950s, the satirical character creations of [[Barry Humphries]] have included housewife "gigastar" [[Edna Everage]] and "Australian cultural attaché" [[Les Patterson]], whose interests include boozing, chasing women and flatulence.<ref>[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/barry-humphries Barry Humphries – australia.gov.au]</ref> For his delivery of dadaist and [[Absurdism|absurdist]] humour to millions, biographer Anne Pender described Humphries in 2010 as "the most significant comedian to emerge since [[Charlie Chaplin]]".<ref>[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/books/absurd-moments-in-the-frocks-of-the-dame-20100914-15ar3.html Barry Humphries &#124; Absurd moments: in the frocks of Dame Edna]</ref>

The vaudeville talents of [[Graham Kennedy]], [[Don Lane]] and [[Bert Newton]] earned popular success during the early years of Australian television. The variety show ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]'' screened for three decades. Among the best loved Australian sitcoms was ''[[Mother and Son]]'', about a divorcee who had moved back into the suburban home of his mother – but [[sketch comedy]] has been the stalwart of [[Australian television]]. ''[[The Comedy Company]]'', in the 1980s, featured the comic talents of [[Mary-Anne Fahey]], [[Ian McFadyen]], [[Mark Mitchell (actor)|Mark Mitchell]], [[Glenn Robbins]], [[Kym Gyngell]] and others. Growing out of [[Melbourne University]] and ''[[The D-Generation]]'' came ''[[The Late Show (1990s Australian TV series)|The Late Show]]'' (1991–1993), starring the influential talents [[Santo Cilauro]], [[Tom Gleisner]], [[Jane Kennedy (actor)|Jane Kennedy]], [[Tony Martin (comedian)|Tony Martin]], [[Mick Molloy]] and [[Rob Sitch]] (who later formed [[Working Dog Productions]]); and during the 1980s and 1990s ''[[Fast Forward (TV series)|Fast Forward]]'' ([[Steve Vizard]], [[Magda Szubanski]], [[Marg Downey]], [[Michael Veitch]], [[Peter Moon (comedian)|Peter Moon]] and others) and its successor ''[[Full Frontal (Australian TV series)|Full Frontal]]'', which launched the career of [[Eric Bana]] and featured [[Shaun Micallef]].

The perceptive wit of [[Clive James]] and [[Andrew Denton]] has been popular in the talk-show interview style. Representatives of the "bawdy" strain of Australian comedy include [[Rodney Rude]], [[Austen Tayshus]] and [[Chad Morgan]]. [[Rolf Harris]] helped defined a comic tradition in [[Australian music]].

Cynical satire has had enduring popularity, with television series such as ''[[Frontline (Australian TV series)|Frontline]]'', targeting the inner workings of "news and current affairs" TV journalism, ''[[The Hollowmen]]'' (2008), set in the office of the Prime Minister's political advisory (spin) department, and ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'', which cynically examines domestic and international politics.<ref name="australia.gov.au"/> Actor/writer [[Chris Lilley (comedian)|Chris Lilley]] has produced a series of award-winning "mockumentary" style television series about Australian characters since 2005.

The annual [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] is one of the largest comedy festivals in the world, and a popular fixture on the city's cultural calendar.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060630110150/http://www.oxfam.org.au/media/article.php?id=12 Media Releases &#124; Oxfam Australia]</ref>

==Arts==
The [[arts in Australia]]—[[cinema of Australia|film]], [[music of Australia|music]], [[art of Australia|painting]], [[theatre]], [[dance in Australia|dance]] and crafts—have achieved international recognition. While much of Australia's cultural output has traditionally tended to fit with general trends and styles in Western arts, the arts as practiced by [[indigenous Australians]] represent a unique Australian cultural tradition, and Australia's landscape and history have contributed to some unique variations in the styles inherited by Australia's various migrant communities.<ref name="painters">{{cite web

===Literature===
{{Main|Australian Literature}} 
As the convict era passed—captured most famously in [[Marcus Clarke]]'s ''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]'' (1874), a seminal work of [[Tasmanian Gothic]]<ref>Davidson, Jim (1989). "Tasmanian Gothic", ''[[Meanjin]]'' '''48''' (2), pp. 307–324</ref>—the bush and Australian daily life assumed primacy as subjects. [[Charles Harpur]], [[Henry Kendall (poet)|Henry Kendall]] and [[Adam Lindsay Gordon]] won fame in the mid-19th century for their lyric nature poems and patriotic verse. Gordon drew on Australian colloquy and idiom; Clarke assessed his work as "the beginnings of a national school of Australian poetry".<ref>Smith, Vivian (2009). "Australian Colonial Poetry, 1788–1888". In Pierce, Peter. ''The Cambridge History of Australian Literature''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. pp. 73–92. {{ISBN|9780521881654}}</ref> First published in serial form in 1882, [[Rolf Boldrewood]]'s ''[[Robbery Under Arms]]'' is regarded as the classic [[bushranger|bushranging]] novel.

[[File:J F Archibald Henry Lawson.jpg|thumb|''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'', founded by [[J. F. Archibald]] (left), nurtured [[bush poetry|bush poets]] such as [[Henry Lawson]] (right).]]
Founded in 1880, ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' did much to create the idea of an Australian national character—one of [[anti-authoritarianism]], [[egalitarianism]], [[mateship]] and a concern for the "[[battler (underdog)|battler]]"—forged against the brutalities of the bush. This image was expressed within the works of its [[bush poetry|bush poets]], the most famous of which are [[Henry Lawson]], widely regarded as Australia's finest short-story writer, and [[Banjo Paterson]], author of classics such as "[[Clancy of the Overflow]]" (1889) and "[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man From Snowy River]]" (1890). In [[Bulletin Debate|a literary debate]] about the nature of life in the bush, Lawson said Paterson was a romantic while Paterson attacked Lawson's pessimistic outlook.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/lawson/ |title=Henry Lawson: Australian writer – Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=2 September 1922 |accessdate=2011-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408180527/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/lawson/ |archivedate=8 April 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> [[C. J. Dennis]] wrote humour in the Australian vernacular, notably in the verse novel ''[[The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke]]'' (1915), while [[Dorothy Mackellar]] wrote the iconic patriotic poem "[[My Country]]" (1908) which rejected prevailing fondness for England's "green and shaded lanes" and declared: "I love a sunburnt country". Early Australian [[children's literature]] was also embedded in the bush tradition; perennial favourites include [[Norman Lindsay]]'s ''[[The Magic Pudding]]'' (1918), [[May Gibbs]]' ''[[Snugglepot and Cuddlepie]]'' (1918) and [[Dorothy Wall]]'s ''[[Blinky Bill]]'' (1933).

Significant poets of the early 20th century include [[Kenneth Slessor]], [[Mary Gilmore]] and [[Judith Wright]]. The nationalist [[Jindyworobak Movement]] arose in the 1930s and sought to develop a distinctive Australian poetry through the appropriation of Aboriginal languages and ideas.<ref>McGregor, Russell (2011).

===Architecture===

[[File:Sydney Opera House Close up HDR Sydney Australia.jpg|thumb|[[Sydney Opera House]] (foreground) and [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]]]
[[File:Melbourne Collins Street Architecture.jpg|thumb|[[Victorian era]] buildings in [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], Melbourne]]

Australia has three architectural listings on [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage]] list: [[Australian Convict Sites]] (comprising a collection of separate sites around Australia, including [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] in Sydney, [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] in Tasmania, and [[Fremantle Prison]] in Western Australia); the [[Sydney Opera House]]; and the [[Royal Exhibition Building]] in Melbourne. Contemporary Australian architecture includes a number of other iconic structures, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] in Sydney and [[Parliament House, Canberra]]. Significant architects who have worked in Australia include Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]'s colonial architect, [[Francis Greenway]]; the ecclesiastical architect [[William Wardell]]; the designer of Canberra's layout, [[Walter Burley Griffin]]; the modernist [[Harry Seidler]]; and [[Jørn Utzon]], designer of the Sydney Opera House. The [[National Trust of Australia]] is a non-governmental organisation charged with protecting Australia's built heritage.

Evidence of permanent structures built by Indigenous Australians before European settlement of Australia in 1788 is limited. Much of what they built was temporary, and was used for housing and other needs. As a British colony, the first European buildings were derivative of the European fashions of the time. Tents and [[wattle and daub]] huts preceded more substantial structures. [[Georgian architecture]] is seen in early government buildings of Sydney and Tasmania and the homes of the wealthy. While the major Australian cities enjoyed the boom of the [[Victorian era]], the [[Australian gold rushes]] of the mid-19th century brought major construction works and exuberant [[Victorian architecture]] to the major cities, particularly Melbourne, and regional cities such as [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] and [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]]. Other significant architectural movements in Australian architecture include the [[Federation style]] at the turn of the 20th century, and the modern styles of the late 20th century which also saw many older buildings demolished. The [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] is the primarily residential style of warm climate architecture developed in Queensland and northern parts of New South Wales.

Religious architecture is also prominent throughout Australia, with large [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] and [[Catholicism in Australia|Catholic]] cathedrals in every major city and Christian churches in most towns. Notable examples include [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]] and  [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney]]. Other houses of worship are also common, reflecting the cultural diversity existing in Australia; the oldest Islamic structure in the Southern Hemisphere is the [[Central Adelaide Mosque]] (built in the 1880s),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://recollections.nma.gov.au/issues/vol_2_no2/notes_and_comments/australias_muslim_cameleer_heritage/ |title=reCollections – Australia's Muslim cameleer heritage |publisher=Recollections.nma.gov.au |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> and one of the Southern Hemisphere's largest [[Buddhist Temple]]s is [[Wollongong]]'s [[Nan Tien Temple]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nantien.org.au/en/about/history.asp |title=Nan Tien Temple-History of Temple |publisher=Nantien.org.au |date=28 November 1991 |accessdate=2011-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220170543/http://www.nantien.org.au/en/about/history.asp |archivedate=20 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Sydney's [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-style [[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Great Synagogue]] was consecrated in 1878.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/ |title=The Great Synagogue Sydney – Home |publisher=Greatsynagogue.org.au |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref>

Historically, [[Australian pubs]] have also been noted for often distinctive designs.

Significant concern was raised during the 1960s, with developers threatening the destruction of historical buildings, especially in Sydney. Heritage concerns led to union-initiated ''[[green ban]]s'', which saved significant examples of Australia's architectural past. Green bans helped to protect historic 18th-century buildings in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]] from being demolished to make way for office towers, and prevented the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]] from being turned into a car park for the Sydney Opera House.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mundey|first=Jack|title=Green bans and beyond|publisher=Angus and Robertson|location=Sydney|year=1981|isbn=0207143676}}</ref>

====Indigenous music====

[[File:Buskers Fremantle Markets.jpg|thumb|[[Didgeridoo]] performers]]
Music is an integral part of Aboriginal culture. The most famous feature of their music is the [[didgeridoo]]. This wooden instrument, used amongst the Aboriginal tribes of northern Australia, makes a distinctive droning sound and it has been adopted by a wide variety of non-Aboriginal performers.

Aboriginal musicians have turned their hand to Western popular musical forms, often to considerable commercial success. Pioneers include [[Lionel Rose]] and [[Jimmy Little]], while notable contemporary examples include [[Archie Roach]], [[Kev Carmody]], the [[Warumpi Band]], [[Troy Cassar-Daley]] and [[Yothu Yindi]]. [[Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu]] (formerly of Yothu Yindi) has attained international success singing contemporary music in English and in the language of the [[Yolngu]]. [[Christine Anu]] is a successful [[Torres Strait Islander]] singer. Amongst young Australian aborigines, [[African American|African-American]] and Aboriginal [[hip hop]] music and clothing is popular.<ref>{{cite news

The [[Deadly Awards]] are an annual celebration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander achievement in music, sport, entertainment and community.

====Folk music and national songs====
[[File:The Old Bush Songs by Banio Paterson.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover of ''Old Bush Songs'', [[Banjo Paterson]]'s 1905 collection of [[bush ballad]]s]]
The [[national anthem]] of Australia is "[[Advance Australia Fair]]".

The early [[Anglo-Celtic]] immigrants of the 18th and 19th centuries introduced folk ballad traditions which were adapted to Australian themes: "[[Botany Bay (song)|Bound for Botany Bay]]" tells of the voyage of British convicts to Sydney, "[[The Wild Colonial Boy]]" evokes the spirit of the bushrangers, and "[[Click Go the Shears]]" speaks of the life of Australian shearers. The lyrics of Australia's best-known folk song, "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", were written by the bush poet Banjo Paterson in 1895. This song remains popular and is regarded as "the nation's unofficial national anthem".<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/epubs/waltzingmatilda/index.php "Who'll come a 'Waltzing Matilda' with me?"], National Library of Australia. Retrieved 24 December 2012.</ref>

Well-known singers of Australian folk music include [[Rolf Harris]] (who wrote "[[Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport]]"), [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]], and [[Eric Bogle]] whose 1972 song "[[And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]" is a sorrowful lament to the Gallipoli Campaign.

====Classical music====
[[File:Melba Rupert Bunny.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of ''[[Nellie Melba|Madame Melba]]'' by Rupert Bunny]]

The earliest Western musical influences in Australia can be traced back to two distinct sources: the first free settlers who brought with them the European classical music tradition, and the large body of convicts and sailors, who brought the traditional folk music of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  The practicalities of building a colony mean that there is very little music extant from this early period although there are samples of music originating from [[Hobart]] and Sydney that date back to the early 19th century.<ref name="Oxford">Oxford, A Dictionary of Australian Music, Edited by Warren Bebbington, Copyright 1998</ref>

[[Nellie Melba]] travelled to Europe in 1886 to commence her international career as an opera singer. She became among the best known Australians of the period and participated in early gramophone recording and radio broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100464b.htm |title=Melba, Dame Nellie (1861–1931) Biographical Entry – Australian Dictionary of Biography Online |publisher=Adb.online.anu.edu.au |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> The establishment of choral societies (c. 1850) and symphony orchestras (c. 1890) led to increased compositional activity, although many Australian classical composers worked entirely within European models. Popular works such as [[Percy Grainger]]'s "[[Country Gardens]]" (1918) were heavily influenced by the folk music of other countries and a conservative British orchestral tradition.<ref name="Oxford"/>

In the mid 20th century, as pressure built to express a uniquely Australian identity in music, composers such as [[John Antill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/artist/antill-john |title=John Antill : Represented Artist Profile |publisher=Australian Music Centre |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> and [[Peter Sculthorpe]] drew influence from nature and Aboriginal culture, and [[Richard Meale]] turned to [[south-east Asia]]n music.<ref name="Oxford"/> [[Nigel Butterley]] combined his penchant for international modernism with an own individual voice.

By the beginning of the 1960s, Australian classical music erupted with influences, with composers incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from Aboriginal and Southeast Asian music and instruments, to American [[jazz]] and [[blues]], to the belated discovery of European atonality and the [[avant-garde]]. Composers like [[Don Banks]], [[Don Kay (composer)|Don Kay]], [[Malcolm Williamson]] and [[Colin Brumby]] epitomise this period.<ref name="Oxford"/> In recent times composers including [[Liza Lim]], [[Nigel Westlake]], [[Ross Edwards]], [[Graeme Koehne]], [[Julian Cochran]], [[Georges Lentz]], [[Elena Kats-Chernin]], [[Richard Mills (composer)|Richard Mills]], [[Brett Dean]] and [[Carl Vine]] have embodied the pinnacle of established [[List of Australian composers|Australian composers]].

Well-known Australian classical performers include: sopranos [[Joan Sutherland|Dame Joan Sutherland]], Dame [[Joan Hammond]], [[Joan Carden]], [[Yvonne Kenny]], and [[Emma Matthews]]; pianists [[Roger Woodward]], [[Eileen Joyce]], [[Geoffrey Tozer]], [[Leslie Howard (musician)|Leslie Howard]] and [[Ian Munro (pianist)|Ian Munro]]; guitarists [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]] and [[Slava Grigoryan]]; horn player [[Barry Tuckwell]]; oboist [[Diana Doherty]]; violinists [[Richard Tognetti]] and [[Elizabeth Wallfisch]]; cellist [[David Pereira]]; orchestras including the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]] and the [[Australian Brandenburg Orchestra]]; and conductors Sir [[Charles Mackerras]], and [[Simone Young]]. Indigenous performers like [[didgeridoo]] player [[William Barton (musician)|William Barton]] and immigrant musicians like Egyptian-born [[oud]] virtuoso [[Joseph Tawadros]] have stimulated interest in their own music traditions and have also collaborated with other musicians and ensembles both in Australia and internationally.

While US and British television is popular in Australia, locally produced content has had many successes. Successful local product has included ''[[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]'' and ''[[Division 4]]'' in the late 1960s and early 1970s, ''[[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]]'' in the late 1960s, ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'' and ''[[The Box (soap opera)|The Box]]'' in the 1970s, ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'' in the 1980s and ''[[A Country Practice]]'' (1981–1993), ''[[Neighbours]]'' and ''[[Home and Away]]'' in the 1980s and 1990s. Many of the shows from the mid-1980s onwards have been exported and have sometimes been even more successful abroad, such as [[Steve Irwin]]'s ''[[The Crocodile Hunter]]''. Popular stars of Australian TV have included: the pioneer variety show hosts [[Graham Kennedy]], [[Bert Newton]], [[Don Lane]] and [[Daryl Somers]], and contemporary talk show hosts [[Andrew Denton]] and [[Rove McManus]]. Popular international exports include [[Dame Edna Everage]], [[Clive James]], [[Geoffrey Robertson]] and [[The Wiggles]].

[[File:Wiggles 2007 Lineup.jpg|thumb|[[The Wiggles]] performing in the United States in 2007]]
While Australia has ubiquitous media coverage, the longest established part of that media is the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC), the Federal Government owned and funded organisation offering national TV and radio coverage. The ABC, like the BBC in Britain, CBC in Canada, and PBS in the United States, is a non-commercial public service broadcaster, showing many [[BBC]] or [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] productions from Britain. The publicly funded [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) has a multicultural focus, broadcasting TV and radio programmes in a variety of languages, as well as world news and documentary programming in English. SBS commenced as a commercial-free enterprise, but this changed in 2006 with the broadcasting of commercials between programs. In 2005, ABC and SBS accounted for 15.7% and 6.1% of the national ratings, respectively.<ref>[http://www.afc.gov.au/gtp/wftvratingsnetwork.html Get the Picture – Free-to-air TV – Ratings – By network] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112035530/http://www.afc.gov.au/gtp/wftvratingsnetwork.html |date=12 November 2009 }}</ref>

Commercial broadcasters include the [[Seven Network]], the [[Nine Network]] and [[Network Ten]] on [[free-to-air]] broadcasting to the larger cities with affiliated regional networks like [[Prime Television]] and [[Win Television]] broadcasting to regional areas. [[Foxtel]], [[Austar]] and [[Optus Television]] have been the main providers of pay TV. [[Fox8|Fox 8]] and [[Sky News Australia]] are among the popular Pay TV channels. The [[Australia Network]], established in 2001, is Australia's international television service, beaming to more than 44 countries across Asia, the Pacific and the Indian subcontinent.

The ABC has made a significant contribution to television drama with popular series like ''[[Brides of Christ (TV miniseries)|Brides of Christ]]'', and to comedy with the 1970s hits ''[[Aunty Jack]]'' and ''[[The Norman Gunston Show]]'' and more recently [[Roy & HG]], ''[[Kath & Kim (Australian TV series)|Kath & Kim]]'' and ''[[The Chaser's War On Everything]]''. Debate about the role of the ABC continues; many assign it a marginal role, as commercial TV and radio stations are far more popular choices. Critics{{Who|date=December 2009}} claim that Australian children view television programs imported largely from the US, however, the Australian Content Standard<ref>http://www.aba.gov.au/contentreg/codes/television/documents/ACS2004Fulltext.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227104435/http://www.aba.gov.au/contentreg/codes/television/documents/ACS2004Fulltext.pdf |date=27 February 2007 }}</ref> requires all free-to-air commercial networks to broadcast an annual minimum of 55% Australian content between 6&nbsp;a.m. and midnight.

==Public holidays==

[[File:Dawn service gnangarra 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anzac Day]] dawn services are held throughout Australia every April.]]

Australia's calendar of public holiday festivals begins with [[New Year's Day]]. This is also the day upon which the Australian Federation officially came into being, however the national day, [[Australia Day]], is celebrated on 26 January, the anniversary of British colonisation. [[Anzac Day]], 25 April is another day strongly associated with Australian nationhood, however it more particularly commemorates Australians who fought in wars and is named to honour the soldiers of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps who landed at Gallipoli, on that same day in 1915, during World War I.

The Christian festivals of [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]] are public holidays in Australia. Christmas Day, 25 December, falls during the [[Southern Hemisphere]] summer.

[[Labour Day]] is also a public holiday, but on different days throughout the nation. The [[Queen's Birthday]] is generally observed on the second Monday in June, except in Western Australia, where it usually is observed in September or October to move it away from [[Western Australia Day]]. On the Queen's Birthday holiday, as on Australia Day, national awards are distributed to distinguished citizens for services to the community.

Contemporary Australian cuisine combines British and indigenous origins with Mediterranean and Asian influences. Australia's abundant natural resources allow access to a large variety of quality meats, and to barbecue beef or lamb in the open air is considered a cherished national tradition. The great majority of Australians live close to the sea and Australian seafood restaurants have been listed among the world's best.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworlds50best.com/module/acms_winners?group_id=1 |title=The Top 50 Best Restaurants 1–50 &#124; The World's 50 Best Restaurants |publisher=Theworlds50best.com |date=15 February 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113043907/http://www.theworlds50best.com/module/acms_winners?group_id=1 |archivedate=13 January 2010 }}</ref>

[[Bush tucker]] refers to a wide variety of plant and animal foods native to the Australian bush: bush fruits such as [[kakadu plum]]s, [[finger lime]]s and [[desert quandong]]s; [[fish]] and [[shellfish]] of Australia's saltwater river systems; and bush meats including [[emu]], [[crocodile]] and [[kangaroo meat|kangaroo]]. Many of these are still seasonally hunted and gathered by Indigenous Australians, and are undergoing a renaissance of interest on contemporary Australian menus.<ref>White, Janelle.

[[File:Sheep eating grass edit02.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sheep grazing in rural Australia. Early British settlers introduced Western stock and crops and [[Australian agriculture]] now produces an abundance of fresh produce.]]
Early British settlers brought familiar meats and crops with them from Europe and these remain important in the Australian diet. The British settlers found some familiar game – such as [[swan]], [[goose]], [[pigeon]], and fish – but the new settlers often had difficulty adjusting to the prospect of [[Australian fauna|native fauna]] as a staple diet.<ref name="culture.gov.au"/> They established agricultural industries producing more familiar Western style produce. Queensland and New South Wales became Australia's main [[beef cattle]] producers, while [[dairy cattle]] farming is found in the southern states, predominantly in Victoria. Wheat and other grain crops are spread fairly evenly throughout the mainland states. [[Sugar cane]] is also a major crop in Queensland and New South Wales. Fruit and vegetables are grown throughout Australia.<ref>[http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/farms/ Australian farms and farming communities – australia.gov.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408181402/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/farms/ |date=8 April 2011 }}</ref> "[[Meat and three veg]]", [[fish and chips]], and the [[Australian meat pie]] continue to represent traditional meals for many Australians.

Australia's 11 million square kilometre fishing zone is the third largest in the world and allows for easy access to seafood which significantly influences Australian cuisine. Clean ocean environments produce high quality seafoods.

Australia's reputation as a nation of heavy drinkers goes back to the earliest days of colonial Sydney, when [[Rum corps#The Corps and rum trafficking in NSW|rum was used as currency]] and grain shortages followed the installation of the first [[still]]s. [[James Squires]] is considered to have founded Australia's first commercial brewery in 1798 and the [[Cascade Brewery]] in Hobart has been operating since 1832. Since the 1970s, Australian beers have become increasingly popular globally, with [[Foster's Lager]] being an iconic export. Foster's is not however the biggest seller on the local market, with alternatives including [[Victoria Bitter]] outselling it.

[[Billy tea]] was a staple drink of the Australian colonial period. It is typically boiled over a camp fire with a gum leaf added for flavouring.

The [[Australian wine]] industry is the world's fourth largest exporter of wine and contributes $5.5 billion per annum to the nation's economy. Wine is produced in every state, however, wine regions are mainly in the southern, cooler regions.

==Sport==
{{Main|Sport in Australia}}
Many Australians are passionate about sport, and it forms a major part of the country's culture in terms of spectating and participation. Cricket is popular in the summer, and football codes are popular in the winter. It is generally agreed that cricket enjoys the most popularity in all parts of the country. Australian traditions such as [[grand finals]] and [[footy tipping]] are shared amongst the codes.

Australia's successes in events such as the [[Olympic Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], World Cup competitions in [[cricket]], [[rugby union]], [[Rugby League World Cup|rugby league]], [[field hockey]], [[netball]], and major tournaments in [[tennis]], [[golf]], [[surfing]], and other sports are a source of pride for many Australians.

In 1908, [[rugby league]] was established in Australia, by former rugby union players and supporters as a breakaway professional code. The new code gained and has maintained a wider following in Australia than rugby union, which remained amateur until the 1990s. The sport has roots in the working class communities of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]] in Northern England, translating to similar areas in [[Sydney]] and [[Brisbane]]. The elite club competition is the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL), which features ten teams from New South Wales, three teams from Queensland, and one team each from Victoria, Australian Capital Territory and New Zealand. The season culminates in the [[NRL Grand Final]]. The New South Wales [[New South Wales rugby league team|Blues]] and Queensland [[Queensland rugby league team|Maroons]] compete in the annual [[State of Origin series]].

Australians have a particular affinity for [[surf lifesaving]], and surf lifesavers have a revered status in Australian culture. The world's first surf lifesaving club, [[Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club]], was founded at [[Bondi Beach]], Sydney, in 1906. [[Surf Life Saving Australia]] has conducted hundreds of thousands of rescues around Australia. Tens of thousands of Australians compete in surf lifesaving training and competitions, such as [[Ironman (surf lifesaving)|Ironman]] events.<ref name="culture.gov.au"/>

The Australian [[V8 Supercars]] series is steadily growing in popularity across the world, where television coverage allows.

Australia regularly raises world champion [[field hockey]] teams. Australian [[Road bicycle racing|cyclists]] have won international cycling competitions, most notably [[Cadel Evans]]' win in the [[2011 Tour de France]]. In 2008, the [[Tour Down Under]], centred around Adelaide, became the first [[UCI ProTour]] cycling race to be held outside of Europe. Among young people and within schools nationwide, various forms of handball or [[downball]] games have been among the most prevalent sports games for some decades.

[[File:Kiandra carnival 1900 Charles Kerry.jpeg|thumb|[[Skiing in Australia]] began in [[Kiandra]], a goldmining town in the [[Snowy Mountains]] of New South Wales, in the 1860s.]]
Snow sports are enjoyed in the [[Australian Alps]] and in Tasmania. [[Skiing in Australia]] was first introduced by Norwegian miners in the gold mining town of [[Kiandra, New South Wales|Kiandra]] in the [[Snowy Mountains]] of New South Wales around 1859. The sport remains a popular winter activity in the south-eastern states and territories. Major [[alpine skiing]] resorts include [[Thredbo]], [[Perisher Ski Resort|Perisher]] and [[Charlotte Pass]] in New South Wales; [[Mount Hotham]], [[Falls Creek, Victoria|Falls Creek]] and [[Mount Buller]] in Victoria and [[Mount Ben Lomond]] in Tasmania. Extensive areas are available for cross country skiing within national parks including [[Kosciuszko National Park]] (NSW), [[Alpine National Park]] (VIC); [[Namadgi National Park]] (ACT) and in the [[Tasmanian Wilderness]]. Australia has long [[Australia at the Winter Olympics|participated in the Winter Olympics]] and has won medals at the Games since the 1990s.

Increased interest and participation in American sports has led to opportunities for Australians to play at the top level in sports such as [[baseball]], [[ice hockey]] and [[American football]]. [[Grant Balfour]] is a relief pitcher for the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], and played in the [[2008 World Series]]. Australian basketballers have done well at the Olympics, coming fourth four times. The skill set of Australian rules footballers fits the mould of US [[National Football League]] (NFL) [[Punter (football)|punters]], and they stand out from their American peers with their ability to tackle returners. Two former AFL footballers competed in the 2009 [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Championship game as punters, [[Saverio Rocca]] for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Ben Graham (football player)|Ben Graham]] for the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. Graham's appearance in [[Super Bowl XLIII]] made him the first Australian to play in the NFL's championship game. The first College Bowl game to feature two Australians was the [[2012 BCS National Championship Game]] with punter [[Brad Wing]] from LSU and defensive end [[Jesse Williams (American football)|Jesse Williams]] for Alabama. In 2018, [[Nathan Walker]], the first Australian drafted by an NHL team, also became the first to play on a Stanley Cup winning team, the 2018 Washington Capitals.

==Folklore==
{{main|Australian folklore}}
[[File:SIMPSON AND HIS DONKEY MONUMENT.jpg|thumb|upright|A commemorative statue of [[John Simpson Kirkpatrick]], a famous stretcher bearer who was killed in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].]]
Australian stories and legends have a cultural significance independent of their empirical truth or falsehood. This can be seen in the portrayal of [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] as a mixture of the underdog and [[Robin Hood]].

Militarily, Australians have served in numerous overseas wars, ranging from [[World War I]] through to recent regional security missions, such as [[East Timor]], [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Australian war culture generally consists of sombre reflection and commemoration, focussing on noble sacrifice rather than glory.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} An annual national holiday, [[Anzac Day]], exists for this purpose. The Australian experience of defeat in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], the first iconic moment in modern Australia's involvement in war, is viewed by Australians with both pride for the fighting of the soldiers, and bitterness for the perceived negligence on the part of British commanders. The incidences of bravery and determination displayed during the campaign for Gallipoli, as well as the mutual respect for their [[Turkey|Turkish]] adversaries led by Kemal [[Atatürk]], are seen as part of the [[ANZAC]] spirit. During the First World War, Australian soldiers were considered to be remarkably determined, united and hard-working. Many Australians knew how to ride and shoot prior to enlistment, making them talented recruits, but they were also infamous for their lax attitude towards formal parade ground discipline, a notoriety that the Australian soldiers revelled in. From this the notion of the larrikin [[Digger (soldier)|Digger]] emerged,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} an important part of contemporary Australian identity.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Attitudes, beliefs and stereotypes==
Critics and scholars have sometimes scrutinised Australian culture, with aspects of it loosely criticised for being [[kitsch]], low-brow or rooted in poor taste.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memory Fragments: Visualising Difference in Australian History|year=2012|publisher=Intellect Books|first=Marita|last=Bullock|page=17|isbn=9781841505534}}</ref> The term "[[cultural cringe]]" was coined to describe this entrenched national inferiority complex which assumes ideas and cultures of other places are automatically superior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/10/1974488.htm |title=Getting over Australia's Cultural Cringe |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Arthur Angel | authorlink = A.

The phrase "[[Lucky Country|the lucky country]]", coined by [[Donald Horne]], is a reference to Australia's weather, lifestyle, and history.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/luckycountry/ The Lucky Country] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007062744/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/luckycountry/ |date=7 October 2006 }}</ref> Ironically, Horne was using the term to denigrate the political [[philistinism]] and criticise the complacency of Australian society in the early 1960s. Since he coined the phrase it has commonly been misapplied by both the media and general public to denote Australia’s perceived fortunes.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

"Mateship", or loyal fraternity is the code of conduct, particularly between men, although more recently also between men and women, stressing equality and friendship.<ref name=GP/><ref name="Mateship Redefined">{{cite web|title=Mateship Redefined|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/mateship-redefined-20130124-2d9dm.html}}</ref><ref name="Mateship Redefined"/><ref>{{cite web|title=The Great Mateship Myth|publisher=The Australian|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/opinion/the-great-mateship-myth/story-e6frg9jx-1226809429369}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Mateship: Hit for six|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/418548.stm}}</ref> The value of mateship is sourced in the difficulty of subduing the land. Unlike other cultures based on a nurturing landscape that they seek to protect from others, Australian settlers experienced great hardship and had to support each other in order to survive. The battle against the elements led to the nickname of a member of Australia's working class being the "Aussie battler".<ref name=GP/>

An aspect of the mateship culture on language is that Australians have a propensity for the diminutive forms of names e.g. Hargrave → Hargie; Wilkinson → Wilko; John → Johnno; David → Davo; Hogan → Hoges; James → Jimmy → Jim → Jimbo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicknames you don't forget|publisher=Brisbane times|url=http://blogs.brisbanetimes.com.au/rhymeorreason/archives/2007/04/nicknames_you_d.html}}</ref> This is a display of affection and acceptance rather than belittlement.

One result of the prevalence of the "mateship" culture is that Australian society is stringently anti-hierarchical. Australians are expected to behave with humility and not think of themselves as better than their peers.<ref name=GP>{{cite book|title=Global Perspectives in Workplace Health Promotion|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1q2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=mateship+nicknames&source=bl&ots=Qg4b2_741J&sig=LMFX2MiiRt_ZnWuU6g3HG9_jKSw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Q6RJVMy4GMSrmAWPhYL4Aw&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=mateship%20nicknames&f=false}}</ref> Any disloyalty to their "mates" is treated harshly, and is known as the tall poppy syndrome, where people who grow greater than their peers are harshly criticised as being narcissistic, or "up themselves". Even the most successful and beautiful Australians are eager to proclaim how ordinary they are, to the extent that two-thirds of the highest earning households define themselves as middle class, lower middle class or even working class.<ref>{{cite web|title=Income distribution: Australia's highest earners think they are battlers|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/income-distribution-australias-highest-earners-think-they-are-battlers-20160212-gmt62w.html}}</ref> This egalitarian social system makes Australian society appear "laid-back" or relaxed to visitors. Most forms of address are by first name or nickname, and only children regularly use titles such as "Sir" or "Ma'am" for authority figures.

The [[mateship]] culture combined with the original convict and then colonial culture has created an irreverence for established authority, particularly if it is pompous or out of touch with reality. Politicians, or "pollies", are generally disliked and distrusted. Politicians who seek to lead must comply to the views of the egalitarian electorate, who will punish any hint of arrogance or glory-seeking behaviour. Voter turnout at elections had in fact been so low that [[compulsory voting]] was introduced for the [[Australian federal election, 1925|1925 federal election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/pdf/voting/compulsory_voting.pdf |title=Compulsory Voting in Australia |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|format=PDF |date=16 January 2006 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>

Mirroring the [[tall poppy syndrome]] which brings back to Earth the high fliers, the egalitarian Australian society has a traditional Australian support for the "[[underdog (competition)|underdog]]."<ref name=GP/> Australians will show support for those who appear to be at a disadvantage even when the underdog is competing against fellow Australians, such as in sporting events. Related to the underdog is the belief in a "fair go", which is said to be a key part of Australian culture and Australian society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/values/book/english/lia_english_full.pdf |title=Living in Australia |publisher=Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship|format=PDF |year=2007 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}</ref> One accepted definition of a "fair go" in this Australian sense is "a chance, an adequate opportunity.
