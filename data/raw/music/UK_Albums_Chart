[[File:Official Albums Chart (UK).jpg|thumb|The Official Albums Chart logo, as introduced by the Official Charts Company in October 2011]]The '''Official Albums Chart''' is a list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015) [[audio streaming]]<ref name="streaming">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/uk-official-albums-chart-to-include-streaming-data-for-first-time-3479/|title=UK's Official Albums Chart to include streaming data for the first time|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref> in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was published for the first time on 22 July 1956 and is compiled every week by the [[Official Charts Company]] (OCC) on Fridays (previously Sundays). It is broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]] (top 5) and published in ''[[Music Week]]'' magazine (top 75), and on the OCC website (top 100).

To qualify for the Official Albums Chart, the album must be the correct length and price. It must be more than three tracks or 20 minutes long and not be classed as a budget album. A budget album costs between £0.50 and £3.75. Additionally, various-artist [[compilation album]]s – which until January 1989 were included in the main album listing – are now listed separately in the "[[UK Compilation Chart|Official Compilation Chart]]". Full details of the rules can be found on the OCC website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/media/647277/official-uk-charts-album-chart-rules-march-2015.pdf|title=Rules for Chart Eligibility: Albums|date=1 March 2015|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=3 November 2015}}</ref>

According to the canon of the OCC, the official British albums chart was the ''[[Melody Maker]]'' chart from 8 November 1958 to March 1960 (although the ''[[Record Mirror]]'' published charts from 22 July 1956<ref>Warwick, Neil; Kutner, Jon; Brown, Tony (2004). The Complete Book of the British Charts: Singles and Albums (3rd ed.). London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|1-84449-058-0}}.</ref>); the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart from 1960 to 1969; and the Official Albums Chart from 1969 on. In the 1970s the new album chart was revealed at 12:45&nbsp;pm on Thursdays on [[BBC Radio 1]], and then moved to 6:05&nbsp;pm (later 6:30&nbsp;pm) on Wednesday evenings during the [[Peter Powell (DJ)|Peter Powell]] and [[Bruno Brookes]] shows. In October 1987 it moved to Monday lunchtimes, during the [[Gary Davies]] show, and from April to October 1993 it briefly had its show from 7:00–8:00&nbsp;pm on Sunday evenings, introduced by [[Lynn Parsons]]. Since October 1993 it has been included in ''[[The Official Chart]]'' show from 4:00 – 5:45&nbsp;pm on Fridays (previously from 4:00 – 7:00&nbsp;pm on Sundays). A weekly 'Album Chart' show was licensed out to [[BBC Radio 2]] and presented by [[Simon Mayo]], until it ended on 2 April 2007.

Though album sales tend to produce more revenue and, over time, act as a greater measure of an artist's success, this chart receives less media attention than the [[UK Singles Chart]], because overall sales of an album are more important than its peak position. 2005 saw a record number of artist album sales with 126.2&nbsp; million sold in the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4588444.stm|title=Blunt boosts record labels' 2005 |publisher=BBC |date=6 January 2008}}</ref> In February 2015, it was announced that due to the falling sales of albums and rise in popularity of audio streaming, the Official Albums Chart would begin including streaming data from March 2015.<ref name="streaming"/> Under the revised methodology, the Official Charts Company takes the 12 most streamed tracks from one album, with the top-two songs being down-weighted in line with the average of the rest. The total of these streams is divided by 1000 and added to the pure sales of the album. This calculation was designed to ensure that the chart rundown continues to reflect the popularity of the albums themselves, rather than just the performance of one or two smash hit singles. The final number one album on the UK Albums Chart to be based purely on sales alone was ''[[Smoke + Mirrors]]'' by [[Imagine Dragons]]. On 1 March 2015, ''[[In the Lonely Hour]]'' by [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]] became the first album to top the new streaming-incorporated Official Albums Chart.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.musicweek.com/businessanalysis/read/sam-smith-tops-first-streaming-integrated-uk-albums-chart/061022|title=Sam Smith tops first streaming integrated UK Albums Chart|last=Jones|first=Alan|date=1 March 2015|work=[[Music Week]]|publisher=Intent Media|accessdate=12 November 2015}}</ref>

The first number one album of the UK Albums Chart was ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'' by [[Frank Sinatra]] on 22 July 1956. As of the week ending date 7 February 2019, the UK Albums Chart has had 1151 different number-one albums. The current number-one album is ''[[Amo (album)|Amo]]'' by [[Bring Me the Horizon]].

In the 2000s, they failed by the narrowest of margins to reach the top in 2005 with ''[[A Bigger Bang]]'', which was the best-selling album of the week in the UK.

For solo artists, [[Elvis Presley]] has scored UK number-one albums in five different decades (the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 2000s and 2010s).

Blues]]'' which stayed at the top for 22 weeks (his ''[[Blue Hawaii (soundtrack)|Blue Hawaii]]'' album was also the longest consecutive number one album for a male artist with 17 weeks). [[Adele]]'s album ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'' has the most weeks at number one by a female solo artist (and by a solo artist of either gender) with 23 weeks, 11 of which were consecutive (which is also a record for a female artist).
