This is a list of artists who have achieved one [[List of number-one singles (UK)|number-one hit]] on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and no other entry whatsoever on the chart. The list uses the strict ''[[The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles]]'' definition of "[[one-hit wonder]]", a term also commonly used more loosely to refer to any act known primarily for one major hit.

==Methodology==
A hit is attributed to the main artist given credit. If a single is released by two artists with the conjunction 'and' or 'versus' then both artists have equal billing (e.g. [[Jane Birkin]] and [[Serge Gainsbourg]]) and are both counted as having a number one (in this case "[[Je t'aime... moi non plus]]") whereas if the conjunction between two artists is 'featuring' or 'with' (or similar) then the first artist is considered the main artist for that hit, with the other artist listed being given a lesser billing (traditionally in these cases they would be additional vocalists or contributing instrumentalists, although in the 21st century it became common for the lead vocalist to be a 'featured' artist).

Artists who are classed as one-hit wonders within the past twelve months are not yet added to the list, as they may still follow-up their number one with another hit. A one-hit wonder from earlier who now goes on to score another hit will be removed from this list.

==Under an alternative name==

* [[The KLF]] scored a single hit as The Timelords (the #1 "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" in 1988), but scored individual hits as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (aka The JAMs) and 2K, and several hits, including another #1, as The KLF.
* [[Isaac Hayes]] reached #1 as [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] with "[[Chocolate Salty Balls|Chocolate Salty Balls (P.S. I Love You)]]" in 1998. He had hits under his own name during the 1970s.

==One hit wonders excluding collaboration work==
This list is the opposite to the "Collaborations classified as one-hit wonders list" as this is artists who went to number one on their own with their only solo hit, however their only additional chart entries were with other artists.

*[[John Denver]] on his own only had a single Top 75 chart entry, with "[[Annie's Song]]" which reached number one in 1974.  He also collaborated with [[Plácido Domingo]] on another single, 1981's "[[Perhaps Love (song)|Perhaps Love]]" which reached #46 and was his only other chart entry. Denver also had five Top 20 albums on the UK Album Chart during the 1970s. His lack of chart success in the United Kingdom stands in contrast to his popularity in his native United States, where he charted 15 Top 40 entries, including four number one singles.
*[[Steve 'Silk' Hurley]] on 24 January 1987 had his only UK solo chart entry "[[Jack Your Body]]"  which went to number 1.  The well-known producer had scored many hits on the [[UK Dance Chart]] and was a member of JM Silk (who have had other chart entries). Hurley refused to promote himself as a solo artist and went on to remix many more chart hits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/stevesilkhurley|title=Steve "Silk" Hurley - Listen and  Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|publisher=}}</ref>

==Collaborations classified as one-hit wonders==
The following collaborations are classified as "one-hit wonders" by Guinness Hit Singles because each of these particular combinations of artists had a single #1 hit with no other chart entries in this particular configuration.

==Aggregate ensemble groups==

The following is a list of aggregate ensemble groups. These are usually [[charity supergroup|put together for charity purposes]]. The ones listed below are one-hit wonders in their respective line-ups, but each is made up of several chart artists. The following line-ups have all reached number one in their only hit under these umbrella group names:

* [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] ("[[Do They Know it's Christmas?]]", 1984)
* [[USA for Africa]] ("[[We Are the World]]", 1985)

As the contestants in the UK TV show ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' were different every year, the group of finalists were different each year as well, despite keeping the same name. In a similar manner, there have been a few different collaborations under the name "Various Artists", which have charted, none of which match the one singing "Perfect Day" as listed above, which is why they are eligible for inclusion on this list.
