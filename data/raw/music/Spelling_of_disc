{{Wiktionary|disc|disk}}

''Disc'' and ''disk'' are two variants of the English word for objects of a generally thin and cylindrical geometry. The differences in spelling correspond both with regional differences and with different [[word sense|senses]] of the word. For example, in the case of [[Disk_storage|flat, rotational data storage media]] the convention is that the spelling ''disk'' is used for [[magnetic storage]] (e.g. [[hard disk]]s) while ''disc'' is used for [[Optical_disc|optical storage]] (e.g. [[compact disc]]s, better known as CDs). When there is no clear convention, the spelling ''disk'' is more popular in [[American English]], while the spelling ''disc'' is more popular in [[British English]].

==Disk==
The earlier word is ''disk'', which came into the [[English language]] in the middle of the 17th century. In the 19th century, ''disk'' became the conventional spelling for [[audio recording]]s made on a flat plate, such as the [[gramophone record]]. Early [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] technicians differentiated between ''disks'' (in-house transcription records) and ''discs'' (the colloquial term for commercial gramophone records, or what the BBC dubbed CGRs).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.orbem.co.uk/grams/grams_4.htm |title= Test Records |date= 2008-03-12 |accessdate= 2013-08-15 |author=Barry Taylor }}</ref>

==UK vs. US==
By the 20th century, the "k" spelling was more popular in the United States, while the "c" variant was preferred in the UK.<ref>{{cite book

| quote = The earlier and better spelling is disk, but disc is now the more usual form in British English, except in sense 2g [computing], where disk is commoner as a result of US influence.}}</ref> In the 1950s, when the American company [[IBM]] pioneered the first [[hard disk drive]] storage devices, it used the "k" spelling. Consequently, in [[computer terminology]] today it is common for the "k" word to refer mainly to magnetic storage devices<ref>{{cite web |url= http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2300 |title= What's the difference between a "disc" and a "disk?" |date=  |accessdate= 2012-02-28 |author= |publisher= [[Apple Inc.]]}}</ref> (particularly in British English, where the term ''disk'' is sometimes regarded as a contraction of ''[[diskette]]'', a much later word and actually a diminutive of ''disk'').

==Computer discs==
Some latter-day competitors to IBM prefer the ''c''-spelling. In 1979, the Dutch company [[Philips]], along with [[Sony]], developed and trademarked the [[compact disc]] using the "c" spelling. The "c" spelling is now used consistently for optical media such as the compact disc and similar technologies.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/disc.html |title=Common Errors in English |author=Paul Brians |publisher=[[Washington State University]] |accessdate= 2008-06-11}}</ref>

==Medical editing==
The words ''disc'' and ''disk'' can appear frequently in [[medical journal]]s and textbooks, especially those in [[ophthalmology]] and [[orthopedic]]s, and thus [[style guide]]s often foster consistency by giving rules for which contexts take which spelling. [[AMA style]] for this topic is used by many publications. AMA says, "For ophthalmologic terms, use ''disc'' (eg, ''optic disc''); for other anatomical terms, use ''disk'' (eg, ''lumbar disk''). In discussions related to computers, use ''disk'' (eg, ''floppy disk, disk drive, diskette'') (exceptions: ''compact disc, videodisc'')."<ref name="AMA_10e_11.1">{{Citation |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al.

==Sports==
[[Flying disc games|Disc sports]], or disc games, are a category of activities which involve throwing and/or catching a [[flying disc]]. Participants of disc sports consistently use the "c" spelling when describing the sports equipment used in these activities, which includes team sports such as [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]] or individual sports such as [[disc golf]].
