'''Livetronica''', also known as '''jamtronica''', started in Philadelphia and is a style of music that blends [[jam band]] elements with those of [[electronica]].<ref name="ew" /><ref name="oakland" /> The name is a [[portmanteau]] of the terms "[[Concert|live music]]" and "[[electronica]]."

The genre traces its roots to the late 1990s and early 2000s, specifically to bands such as [[The Disco Biscuits]], [[STS9]], and [[The New Deal (band)|The New Deal]].<ref name="Back to the Future: An Oral History of Livetronica">{{cite web|last1=Eisen|first1=Benji|title=Back to the Future: An Oral History of Livetronica|url=http://www.relix.com/articles/detail/back_to_the_future_an_oral_history_of_livetronica|website=Relix.com|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> Although STS9 guitarist Hunter Brown has expressed basic reservations about the "livetronica" label, explaining that "it's a really vague term to describe a lot of bands," he did cite [[Tortoise (band)|Tortoise]] as stylistic precursors.<ref name="oakland" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' also identified [[Prefuse 73]], [[VHS or Beta]], [[Lotus (American band)|Lotus]], [[Signal Path]], [[MFA (band)|MFA]], and [[Midwest Product]] as notable livetronica groups.<ref name="ew" />
