'''Belgium''' has participated in the '''Eurovision Song Contest''' 60 times since making its debut as one of the seven countries at the first contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]]. The only countries with more appearances are [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|Germany]] (62), [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]] (61) and the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] (61). Belgium have been absent only three times in total, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001]], due to low scores in the previous contests that relegated them from the contest. Belgium has won the contest once, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986]].

In the first 20 years of the contest, Belgium's best result was [[Tonia (singer)|Tonia]]'s fourth place in 1966. In 1978, [[Jean Vallée]] achieved Belgium's first top three placement, when he was second. [[Sandra Kim]] became the first and to date only winner for Belgium in {{escyr|1986}}, when she won as a 13-year-old in [[Bergen]], performing the song "[[J'aime la Vie]]". Belgium's only other top three result came in {{escyr|2003}}, when the group [[Urban Trad]] finished second in [[Riga]], losing out by only two points. Belgium have finished last in the contest eight times, most recently in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]], and have twice received "nul points"; in {{escyr|1962}} and {{escyr|1965}}. 

After the introduction of the semi-final round in {{escyr|2004}}, Belgium failed to reach the final for five consecutive years (2005–09). Since 2010, Belgium have become more successful, qualifying for the final in five out of nine contests and placing in the top 10 four times, with [[Tom Dice]] sixth  ({{escyr|2010}}), [[Loïc Nottet]] fourth ({{escyr|2015}}), [[Laura Tesoro]] tenth ({{escyr|2016}}), and [[Blanche (singer)|Blanche]] fourth ({{escyr|2017}}).

==History==
Belgium has two national broadcasters of the contest, [[Flemish Community|Flemish]] broadcaster [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep]] (VRT) and [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking]] broadcaster [[RTBF|Radio télévision belge de la communauté française]] (RTBF). The two broadcasters rotate selection for the Eurovision Song Contest each year (currently starting with 2002, VRT in the even-numbered years and RTBF in the odd-numbered years; until 1993 BRT/BRTN in the odd-numbered years and RTB/RTBF in the even-numbered years).

While VRT normally hosts a national final, [[Eurosong (Belgium)|Eurosong]], when selecting their entries for Eurovision, it has been normal for RTBF to hold an internal selection process (although it has been known for RTBF to hold a national final at times, for example in [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]], [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/national_finals_90s_00s/Belgium1998.html |title=Belgian National Final 1998 |accessdate=2009-04-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022062638/http://geocities.com/national_finals_90s_00s/Belgium1998.html |archivedate=22 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/national_finals_90s_00s/Belgium2005.html |title=Belgian National Final 2005 |accessdate=2009-04-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022081917/http://geocities.com/national_finals_90s_00s/Belgium2005.html |archivedate=22 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> and [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]], while VRT internally chose Tom Dice for the 2010 edition and Sennek for the 2018 edition).

===20th century===
[[Tonia (singer)|Tonia]]'s fourth-place at the {{escyr|1966}} contest remained Belgium's best result until [[Jean Vallée]] finished second in {{escyr|1978}}. By 1980, Belgium had finished last in the contest five times, in {{escyr|1961}}, {{escyr|1962}}, {{escyr|1965}}, {{escyr|1973}} and {{escyr|1979}}.

Following good results for [[Stella Maessen|Stella]] (fourth in {{escyr|1982}}) and [[Jacques Zegers]] (fifth in {{escyr|1984}}), Belgium finished last for the sixth time in {{escyr|1985}}. This was followed by Belgium's first (and only) Eurovision victory in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986]], when [[Sandra Kim]] won with her song "[[J'aime la vie]]" in [[Bergen]], Norway. Although she claimed she was 15 years old, she was actually only 13, but was allowed to keep her victory. Currently the minimum age for participation is 16 and thus Sandra Kim will remain the youngest winner unless the age limit is lowered. By winning in 1986, Belgium became the last of the French-speaking countries to win the contest, as France, Luxembourg, Monaco and Switzerland all had won at least once before. Belgium scored an absolute record at the time, with Sandra Kim earning a never seen before amount of 176 points (that record remained until 1993, with Ireland scoring 187 points), an average of 9.26 points per voting nation. Kim received 77.2% of the maximum possible score, which, as of 2017, still ranks eighth among all Eurovision winners.

Belgium finished last for the seventh  time at the {{escyr|1993}} contest, before achieving its only top ten result of the decade at the {{escyr|1998}} contest in [[Birmingham]], where [[Mélanie Cohl]] finished sixth.

===2000s===
Belgium finished last in the contest for the eighth and (as of 2018) final time at the {{escyr|2000}} contest in [[Stockholm]], before achieving its best result of the 21st century in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]], where [[Urban Trad]] sang in an invented language and earned second place with 165 points, losing out to [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest|Turkey]]'s [[Sertab Erener]] by just two points. [[Ishtar (band)|Ishtar]] did the same in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], but finished 17th in the first semi-final, failing to qualify for the final. In the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], Belgium participated in the first semi-final on 12 May 2009, however they received just one point which came from Armenia and left them in second-last position.

===2010–14===
The [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] entry for Belgium was [[Tom Dice]], runner-up of the [[X Factor (Belgium)|Belgian Flemish version]] of ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2008. Dice was internally selected and announced by VRT on 25 November 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14532 |title=Tom Dice to represent Belgium in Oslo |last=Hondal |first=Victor |date=2009-11-25 |publisher=''ESCToday'' |accessdate=25 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128092312/http://esctoday.com/news/read/14532 |archivedate=28 November 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.een.be/programmas/de-rode-loper/naar-het-eurovisiesongfestival |title=Tom Dice gaat naar het Eurovisiesongfestival |date=2009-11-25 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]] |language=Dutch |accessdate=25 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129150655/http://www.een.be/programmas/de-rode-loper/naar-het-eurovisiesongfestival |archivedate=29 November 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref> Tom Dice finished 1st in the first semi-final, allowing Belgium to participate to the final for the first time since the introduction of the semi-finals. He eventually finished 6th, Belgium's best result since 2003, and along with 1959, the best result ever for a Flemish entrant, since Belgum's all top 5 placings have been achieved by the representantives of the French-language broadcaster RTBF.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eurovision 2010: complete televoting and jury results|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2010/06/30/eurovision-2010-complete-televoting-and-jury-results/6544/|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=wiwibloggs.com|date=30 June 2010}}</ref>

In [[Eurovision Song Contest|2011]], the entry for Belgium was [[Witloof Bay]]. They didn't qualify for the finals, finishing 11th only one point behind Moldova, and thus 1 point behind the qualification.<ref>{{cite news|title=Semi-final results at Eurovision 2011|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2011/05/15/semi-final-results-at-eurovision-2011/11261/|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=wiwibloggs.com|date=15 May 2011}}</ref>

Due to the good results and the Flemish population's choice, the VRT cancelled 'Eurosong' selection procedure and chose internally for 2012. For the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]], they choose 17-year-old singer [[Iris (singer)|Iris]] but decided to let the public choose what song she would sing to represent [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Belgium]]. However, she didn't qualify after finishing 17th of 18 entrants in the first semi-final, scoring just 16 points which was the second lowest total of all the 36 semi-final entrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbvl.be/nieuws/media-en-cultuur/aid863978/een-begraaft-eurosong-als-selectie-voor-het-songfestival.aspx|title=Eén begraaft Eurosong als selectie voor het Songfestival

In 2013, [[Roberto Bellarosa]], winner of ''[[The Voice Belgique]]'', was chosen to represent Belgium for the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö, Sweden. Bellarosa made it into the final and finished in 12th place.<ref>{{cite web|last=Griper|first=Ann|title=Who are Eurovision Song Contest 2013 winners?

In 2014, VRT organized a national final again<ref>{{cite news|title=Belgium: VRT confirms participants for Eurosong 2014|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2014/01/24/belgium-possible-participants-eurosong-2014/37518/|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=wiwibloggs.com|date=24 January 2014}}</ref>  and 30 participants were selected to enter the castings. Axel Hirsoux won the national final, with more than 50 percent of the televotes and four times (out of 7 international juries) the maximum of 12 points from the international juries. The song which represented Belgium was called 'Mother' and is a slow ballad.<ref>{{cite news|title=Belgium: Axel Hirsoux wins Eurosong with 'Mother'|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2014/03/16/belgium-axel-hirsoux-wins-eurosong-with-mother/43335/|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=wiwibloggs.com|date=16 March 2014}}</ref> The song failed to qualify for the final, finishing 14th out of 16.

===2015–present===
In 2015, RTBF chose another "The Voice Belgique" participant [[Loïc Nottet]], who came second in 2014. He represented Belgium with his song [[Rhythm Inside (Loïc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]] in the first semi-final of the competition. He managed to qualify and came second with 149 points. In the final Loïc finished fourth with 217 points. It was the best result for Belgium since 2003 and it was the highest amount of points ever awarded to Belgium. It was also the first time ever that an entry who finished fourth scored over 200 points.

On 26 May 2015 VRT confirmed that it would use Eurosong again as the national final for the 2016 competition. This time the show only had 5 participants. Eurosong 2016 would span over 3 shows, but only in the last show could people vote for the entry who would represent Belgium at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]]. On 17 January 2016 [[Laura Tesoro]] won Eurosong 2016 with her song [[What's the Pressure]], co-written by Belgian singer [[Selah Sue]]. Other contenders were Tom Frantzis, Adil Aarab, Amaryllis Uitterlinden and Astrid Destuyver.

Laura Tesoro performed last at the second semi-final on 12 May 2016, and qualified for the final by finishing in third place on 274 points. In the final on 14 May 2016, she performed first and placed tenth on 181 points.

The Wallonian broadcaster RTBF announced on 22 November 2016 that Ellie Delvaux would represent Belgium in the 2017 contest under her stage name [[Blanche (singer)|Blanche]]. Blanche had also appeared on "The Voice Belgique", like her predecessors Roberto Bellarosa (2013), Axel Hirsoux (2014) and Loïc Nottet (2015). It will be the fifth consecutive year that the Belgian representative was a former "The Voice" contestant, Laura Tesoro (2016) appeared on the Flemish version "The Voice van Vlaanderen". 

On 8 March 2017, the song "City Lights" was officially announced as the Belgian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. It was leaked the night before, on 7 March 2017, through [[Spotify]]. Competing in the first half of the first semi-final on 9 May 2017, [[Blanche (singer)|Blanche]] qualified for the final on 13 May and performed in the second half of the show, finishing in fourth place. Blanche's fourth-place finish gave Belgium its third top six result of the decade. The only other decade where Belgium achieved this, was the 1980s.

During the Eurovision weekend of {{escyr|2017}}, [[Peter Van de Veire]] announced that VRT would internally select the participant for {{escyr|2018}}. On 28 September 2017, VRT announced [[Laura Groeseneken]] as the Belgian entrant during the talk show ''Van Gils & gasten'', aired on [[Één]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/150246/belgium-vrt-will-reveal-the-belgian-act-for-eurovision-2018-tonight/|title=Belgium: VRT will reveal the Belgian act for Eurovision 2018 tonight|publisher=Esctoday.com|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=28 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.een.be/een/laura-groeseneken-naar-het-eurovisiesongfestival|title=Laura Groeseneken naar het Eurovisiesongfestival!|publisher=VRT|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=28 September 2017|language=nl}}</ref> Although initially a favorite with bookmakers, "[[A Matter of Time (Sennek song)|A Matter of Time]]" was the first Belgian entry since 2014 to not qualify for the final. She finished 12th with 91 points in the first semi-final.

;'''NOTES''':
{{ref begin}}
{{ordered list|type=a
|1= {{Note_label|A|a|none}} The full results for the first contest in 1956 are unknown, only the winner was announced. The official Eurovision site lists all the other songs as being placed second.<ref name="ESC1956 History">{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=Simon|title=The Complete and Independent Guide to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010|publisher=Silverthorn Press|date=June 17, 2010|page=24|isbn=978-1-4457-8415-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BfuBF7fOnyoC}}</ref>
|2= {{Note_label|B|b|none}} If a country had won the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. In addition from 2004-2007, the top ten countries who were not members of the big four did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. If, for example, Germany and France placed inside the top ten, the countries who placed 11th and 12th were advanced to the following year's grand final along with the rest of the top ten countries.
|3= {{Note_label|C|c|none}} Spain originally gave its 12 points to Israel and 10 to Norway. After the broadcast it was announced that Spanish broadcaster wrongly tallied the votes and Germany should have got the top mark - 12 points - instead of being snubbed, as it happened. The mistake was corrected and so Germany was placed 7th over Norway. Israel and Norway both received 2 points less than originally and Croatia, Malta, Portugal, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia and Turkey all received one point less than indicated during the broadcast.

==Commentators and spokespersons==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}

Belgium has two broadcast stations [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]] (Dutch speaking region) & [[RTBF]] (French speaking region). Both broadcast the event and over the years VRT and RTBF commentary has been provided by several experienced radio and television presenters, including [[Nand Baert]], [[Jacques Mercier]], [[Luc Appermont]] and [[Paule Herreman]]. However, since the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991 Contest]], [[André Vermeulen]] has provided the Dutch language commentary every year, with the exception of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996 Contest]]. Whilst [[Jean-Pierre Hautier]] has provided the French language commentary every year since the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994 Contest]]. In 1962 VRT used the commentary from [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] (The Netherlands broadcast), the reason for that was unknown.
