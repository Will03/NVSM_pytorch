'''Tor2web''' ( pronounced "Tor to Web" ) is a software project to allow [[List of Tor hidden services|Tor hidden services]] to be accessed from a standard [[web browser|browser]] without being connected to the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor network]]. It was created by [[Aaron Swartz]] and [[Virgil Griffith]].<ref name=wired>{{cite web|first=Kim|last=Zetter|title=New Service Makes Tor Anonymized Content Available to All|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/12/tor-anonymized/|publisher=wired.com|accessdate=22 February 2014|date=12 December 2008}}</ref>

==History==
Tor is a network which enables people to use the Internet anonymously (though with known [[Tor (anonymity network)#Weaknesses|weaknesses]]) and to publish content on "hidden services", which exist only within the Tor network for security reasons and thus are typically only accessible to the relatively small number of people using a Tor-connected web browser. [[Aaron Swartz]] and [[Virgil Griffith]] developed Tor2web in 2008 as a way to support [[whistleblowing]] and other forms of [[anonymity|anonymous]] [[web publishing|publishing]] through Tor, allowing materials to remain anonymous while making them accessible to a broader audience.<ref name=indefense/><ref name=ars>{{cite web|title=tor2web brings anonymous Tor sites to the "regular" web|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/12/tor2web-brings-anonymous-tor-sites-to-the-regular-web/|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=22 February 2014|date=15 December 2008|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' Swartz explained that Tor is great for anonymous publishing, but because its focus is not user-friendliness and thus not many people would install it, he wanted to "produce this hybrid where people could publish stuff using Tor and make it so that anyone on the internet could view it".<ref name=wired/>

The software developed by Swartz and Griffith is today considered version 1.0. Since then, it has been maintained and developed by Giovanni Pellerano from the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights as part of the [[GlobaLeaks|GlobaLeaks Project]], with financial support from the [[Open Technology Fund]]. Version 2.0 was released in August 2011, and version 3.0 is in beta {{as of|2014|12|lc=y}}.<ref name=version2>{{cite web|url=http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Aug/184|title=Tor2web 2.0 is live!|first=Arturo|last=Filast√≤|website=Seclists}}</ref>

==Operation and security==
Rather than typical [[top-level domain]]s like <code>.com</code>, <code>.org</code>, or <code>.net</code>, hidden service [[URL]]s end with <code>[[.onion]]</code> and are only accessible when connected to Tor. Tor2web acts as a specialized [[HTTP proxy|proxy]] or [[intermediary|middleman]] between hidden services and users, making them visible to people who are not connected to Tor. To do so, a user takes the URL of a hidden service and replaces <code>.onion</code> with <code>.tor2web.io</code>.

Like Tor, Tor2web operates using servers run voluntarily by an open community of individuals and organizations.

Tor2web preserves the anonymity of content publishers but is not itself an anonymity tool and does not offer any protection to users beyond relaying data using [[HTTP Secure]] (HTTPS). Since version 2.0, a privacy and security warning is added to the header of each web page it fetches, encouraging readers to use the [[Tor Browser Bundle]] to obtain anonymity.
