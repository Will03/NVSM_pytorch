The darknets which constitute the dark web include small, [[friend-to-friend]] [[peer-to-peer]] networks, as well as large, popular networks like [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], [[Freenet]], [[I2P]], and [[Riffle (anonymity network)|Riffle]] operated by public organizations and individuals.

The darknet encryption technology routes users' data through a large number of intermediate servers, which protects the users' identity and guarantees anonymity.

In March 2017 the [[Congressional Research Service]] released an extensive report on the dark web, noting the changing dynamic of how information is accessed and presented on it; characterized by the unknown, it is of increasing interest to researchers, law enforcement, and policymakers.<ref name="Congression Research Service Report">{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44101.pdf |title=Dark Web |last=Finklea |first=Kristin |date=2017-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320192455/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44101.pdf |archivedate=2017-03-20 |df= }}</ref>

In August 2017, according to reportage, cybersecurity firms which specialize in monitoring and researching the dark web on behalf of banks and retailers routinely share their findings with the [[FBI]] and with other law enforcement agencies "when possible and necessary" regarding illegal content. The Russian-speaking underground offering a crime-as-a-service model is regarded as being particularly robust.<ref name="Dark Web Mainstream Media Coverage">{{Cite web |url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/nation-world/national/article164797842.html |title=Shocked by gruesome crime, cyber execs help FBI on dark web |last=Johnson |first=Tim |date=2017-08-02 |website=Idaho Statesman}}</ref>

== Journalism ==
Many individual [[journalist]]s, alternative [[News agency|news organizations]], educators, and researchers are influential in their writing and speaking of the Darknet, and making its use clear to the general public.

===Jamie Bartlett===
[[Jamie Bartlett (journalist)|Jamie Bartlett]] is a journalist and tech [[blogger]] for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' and Director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media for [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] in conjunction with [[The University of Sussex]]. In his book, ''The Dark Net'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-dark-netinside-the-digital-underworld-by-jamie-bartlett-book-review-9696473.html|title=The Dark Net:Inside the Digital Underworld by Jamie Bartlett, book review|last=Burrell|first=Ian|date=August 28, 2014|website=Independent|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620142200/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-dark-netinside-the-digital-underworld-by-jamie-bartlett-book-review-9696473.html|archivedate=June 20, 2015|df=}}</ref> Bartlett depicts the world of the Darknet and its implications for human behavior in different context. For example, the book opens with the story of a young girl who seeks positive feedback to build her self-esteem by appearing naked online. She is eventually traced on social media sites where her friends and family were inundated with naked pictures of her. This story highlights the variety of [[Interpersonal relationship|human interactions]] the Darknet allows for, but also reminds the reader how participation in a [[overlay network]] like the Darknet is rarely in complete separation from the larger Web. Bartlett's main objective is an exploration of the Darknet and its implication for society. He explores different [[Subculture|sub-cultures]], some with positive implications for society and some with negative.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/growth-dark-subcultures-internet/|title=The Growth of Dark Subcultures On the Internet, The Leonard Lopate Show|date=June 2, 2015|website=WNYC|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020043736/http://www.wnyc.org/story/growth-dark-subcultures-internet/|archivedate=October 20, 2016|df=}}</ref>

Bartlett gave a [[TED (conference)|TEDTalk]] in June 2015 further examining the subject.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_bartlett_how_the_mysterious_dark_net_is_going_mainstream#t-705685|title=How the mysterious dark net is going mainstream|last=Bartlett|first=Jamie|date=June 2015|website=ted.com|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020042728/https://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_bartlett_how_the_mysterious_dark_net_is_going_mainstream#t-705685|archivedate=2016-10-20|df=}}</ref> His talk, entitled "How the mysterious Darknet is going mainstream", introduces the idea behind the Darknet to the audience, followed by a walkthrough example of one of its websites called [[The Silk Road (anonymous marketplace)|the Silk Road]]. He points out the familiarity of webpage design similar to consumer sites used in the larger commercial Web. Bartlett then presents examples of how operating in an uncertain, high-risk market like those in the Darknet actually breeds innovation that he believes can be applied to all markets in the future. As he points out, because vendors are always thinking of new ways to get around and protect themselves, the Darknet has become more decentralized, more customer friendly, harder to censor, and more innovative. As our societies are increasingly searching for more ways to retain privacy online, such changes as those occurring in the Darknet are not only innovative, but could be beneficial to commercial online websites and markets.

===Other media===

Traditional media and news channels like [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] have also featured articles examining the Darknet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-27/explainer-what-is-the-dark-net/7038878|title=Print Email Facebook Twitter More What is the dark net, and how will it shape the future of the digital age?|last=Viney|first=Steven|date=January 27, 2016|website=ABC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020060907/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-27/explainer-what-is-the-dark-net/7038878|archivedate=October 20, 2016|df=}}</ref> ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine published an article in October 2016 entitled "The Other Internet". The article discusses the rise of the Dark Net and mentions that the stakes have become high in a lawless digital wilderness. It mentions that vulnerability is a weakness in a network's defenses. Other topics include the [[e-commerce]] versions of conventional black markets, cyberweaponry from TheRealDeal, and role of operations security.<ref name="The Other Internet">{{Cite journal|title=The Other Internet|journal=Vanity Fair|volume=58}}</ref>
