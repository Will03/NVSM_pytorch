'''Wireless community networks''' ('''WCNs''') or '''wireless community projects''' are the organizations that attempt to take a [[grassroots]] approach to providing a viable alternative to [[municipal wireless network]]s for consumers.<ref>{{cite conference|title=A Survey on Centralised and Distributed Clustering Routing Algorithms for WSNs|date=May 2015|publisher=|pages=1–6|doi=10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145650|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Morteza_Mohammadi_Zanjireh/publication/274638337_A_Survey_on_Centralised_and_Distributed_Clustering_Routing_Algorithms_for_WSNs/links/552444b80cf2b123c5173968/A-Survey-on-Centralised-and-Distributed-Clustering-Routing-Algorithms-for-WSNs.pdf|author=Morteza M.

Because of evolving technology and locales, there are at least four different types of solution:
* Cluster: Advocacy groups which simply encourage sharing of unmetered internet bandwidth via [[Wi-Fi]], may also index nodes, suggest uniform [[SSID#Service set identifier .28SSID.29|SSID]] (for low-quality roaming), supply equipment, [[Domain Name System|DNS]] services, etc.
* [[Wireless mesh network|Mesh]]: Technology groups which coordinate building a [[mesh network]] to provide Wi-Fi access to the internet
* [[Wireless Internet service provider|WISP]]: A mesh that forwards all traffic back to consolidated [[link aggregation]] point(s) that have centralized access to the internet
* [[Wireless user group|WUG]]: A wireless user group run by wireless enthusiasts. An open network not used for the reselling of internet. Running a combination of various off the shelf WIFI hardware running in the license free [[ISM band]]s 2.4&nbsp;GHz/5.8&nbsp;GHz

Certain countries regulate the selling of internet access, requiring a license to sell internet access over a wireless network. In [[South Africa]] it is regulated by the [[Independent Communications Authority of South Africa]] (ICASA).<ref>{{cite book|title=OECD Economic Surveys: South Africa 2008: South Africa - Economic Assessment|author=OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop|date=July 24, 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXUw79-aEVkC&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=Independent+Communications+Authority+of+South+Africa+wireless+access&source=bl&ots=aLjMsQBbZ9&sig=hIYAq4QkUlpy2yW6VKs4u23srmc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SIETT7qmBsfKiALH47iuDQ&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=Independent%20Communications%20Authority%20of%20South%20Africa%20wireless%20access&f=false|page=103|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-04692-4}}</ref> They require that WISP's apply for a VANS or ECNS/ECS license before being allowed to resell internet access over a wireless link.

The cluster and mesh approaches are more common but rely primarily on the sharing of unmetered residential and business [[DSL]] and [[cable Internet]]. This sort of usage might be non-compliant with the [[Terms of Service]] (ToS) of the typical local providers that deliver their service via the consumer phone and cable duopoly. Wireless community network sometimes advocate complete freedom from censorship, and this position may be at odds with the [[Acceptable use policy|Acceptable Use Policies]] of some commercial services used. Some ISPs do allow sharing or reselling of bandwidth.<ref>[https://www.eff.org/Infrastructure/Wireless_cellular_radio/wireless_friendly_isp_list.html Wireless-Friendly ISPSs] [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] accessed 4 May 2011</ref>

==History==
These projects are in many senses an evolution of [[amateur radio]], and more specifically [[packet radio]], as well as an outgrowth of the [[free software]] community (which in itself substantially overlaps with amateur radio){{citation needed|date=December 2010}}. The key to using standard wireless networking devices designed for short-range use for multi-kilometre [[Long Range Wi-Fi]] linkups is the use of high-gain [[directional antenna]]s. Rather than purchasing commercially available units, such groups sometimes advocate homebuilt antenna construction. Examples include the [[cantenna]], which is typically constructed from a [[Pringles]] potato chip can, and [[RONJA]], an optical link that can be made from a smoke [[flue]] and [[LED]]s, with [[circuitry]] and instructions released under the [[GFDL]]. As with other [[wireless mesh network]]s, three distinct generations of mesh networks are used in wireless community networks.<ref>[http://wireless-straight-talk.blogspot.com/2006/11/talkin-bout-my-generation.html Talkin' 'bout my generation] November 16, 2006</ref><ref>[http://perspektive89.com/2006/10/18/free_culture_free_software_free_infrastructures_openness_and_freedom_in_every_layer_of_the_network_flo_fleissig_episo  Free Culture, Free Software, Free Infrastructures!], Interviews with Klohjschi, Jürgen Neumann (Freifunk Germany), Kurt Jansson (Wikimedia Germany), Rishab Aiyer Ghosh (United Nations University), Lawrence Lessig (Creative Commons), Allison, Benoit (Montréal Wireless Community) October 18, 2006</ref> In particular, in the 2004 timeframe, some mesh projects suffered poor performance when scaled up.<ref>[http://www.muniwireless.com/article/articleview/4537/1/2/Performance Analysis of Mesh Architectures] December 8, 2004</ref><ref>[http://www.dailywireless.org/2004/06/28/ugly-truth-about-mesh-networks/ Ugly truth about mesh networks] June 28, 2004</ref>

==Organization==
Organizationally, a wireless community network requires either a set of affordable commercial technical solutions or a critical mass of hobbyists willing to tinker to maintain operations. Mesh networks require that a high level of community participation and commitment be maintained for the network to be viable. The mesh approach currently requires uniform equipment. One market-driven aspect of the mesh approach is that users who receive a weak mesh signal can often convert it to a strong signal by obtaining and operating a repeater node, thus extending the mesh network.

Such volunteer organizations focusing in technology that is rapidly advancing sometimes have schisms and mergers.{{cn|date=May 2014}} The Wi-Fi service provided by such groups is usually free and without the stigma of [[piggybacking (internet access)|piggybacking]]. An alternative to the voluntary model is to use a [[co-operatives|co-operative]] structure.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9244199 Easier said than done: Second thoughts about municipal Wi-Fi] May 25th 2007</ref>

==People's Open Network==
People's Open Network is a [[community wireless network|community wireless mesh network]] being built by a local volunteer group, Sudo Mesh, based in [[Oakland, California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peoplesopen.net/|title=Welcome to the People's Open Network|website=peoplesopen.net|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref> It is a project of the [[Sudo Room]] hackerspace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://localwiki.org/oakland/Mesh_Network|title=Mesh Network - Oakland - LocalWiki|website=localwiki.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Adele |date=2017-12-19 |title=Want To Guarantee Net Neutrality?

Community members can join the network by purchasing an internet router and installing open-source firmware on the device. Once plugged in, the router can connect to the active mesh network and double as a hotspot that automatically connects with others in range. The group even runs educational workshops to spread awareness and help the public learn to create their own mesh networking solutions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mobiwm.com/technology/mesh-networking-net-neutrality/|title=Mesh Networking - Is This the Beginning of a New Kind of Net Neutrality?|date=2018-01-05|work=MOBI|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}</ref>

Matt Senate, one of the founders of Sudo Room, told Tech President in 2014 that Sudo Mesh is “building and growing a network run by and for the community." Senate explained that Occupy Oakland offered a new style of governance and that the People’s Open Network was building that community ethos into the telecommunications infrastructure. 

Jenny Ryan, a cyberanthropologist, free culture advocate, and one of the original members of the Sudo Mesh team, noted the East Bay has long nourished a particularly radical streak, largely at odds with authority. She told Tech President that Oakland “building a community-owned telecommunications infrastructure is one piece to the larger picture of building autonomy and people power.” <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://techpresident.com/news/25200/oakland-sudo-mesh-counter-censorship-digital-divide-mesh-net|title=Oakland's Sudo Mesh Looks to Counter Censorship and Digital Divide With a Mesh Network|website=TechPresident|access-date=2018-02-18}}</ref>
