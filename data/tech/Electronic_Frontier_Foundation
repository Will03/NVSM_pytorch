The '''Electronic Frontier Foundation''' ('''EFF''') is an international non-profit [[digital rights]] group based in [[San Francisco, California]]. The foundation was formed in July, 1990 by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[John Perry Barlow]] and [[Mitch Kapor]] to promote [[Internet]] [[civil liberties]].

EFF provides funds for legal defense in court, presents [[amicus curiae]] briefs, defends individuals and new [[Technology|technologies]] from what it considers abusive legal threats, works to expose [[government]] malfeasance, provides guidance to the government and [[court]]s, organizes political action and mass mailings, supports some new technologies which it believes preserve [[Liberty|personal freedoms]] and online civil liberties, maintains a [[database]] and web sites of related news and information, monitors and challenges potential [[legislation]] that it believes would infringe on [[Liberty|personal liberties]] and [[fair use]] and solicits a list of what it considers [[Patent misuse|abusive patents]] with intentions to defeat those that it considers without [[merit (law)|merit]].

EFF also provides tips, tools, how-tos, tutorials, and software for safer online communications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tools from EFF's Tech Team|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/tools}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Surveillance Self-Defense|url=https://ssd.eff.org/}}</ref>

===Foundation===
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formed in July 1990 by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[John Perry Barlow]] and [[Mitch Kapor]] in response to a series of actions by law enforcement agencies that led them to conclude that the authorities were gravely uninformed about emerging forms of online communication,<ref name=j1/> and that there was a need for increased protection for [[Internet]] [[civil liberties]].

In April 1990, Barlow had been visited by a U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent in relation to the theft and distribution of the source code for a series of Macintosh ROMs. Barlow described the visit as "complicated by [the agent's] fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology. I realized right away that before I could demonstrate my innocence, I would first have to explain to him what guilt might be." Barlow felt that his experience was symptomatic of a "great paroxysm of governmental confusion during which everyone's liberties would become at risk".

Barlow posted an account of this experience to [[The WELL]] online community and was contacted by Mitch Kapor, who had had a similar experience. The pair agreed that there was a need to defend civil liberties on the Internet. Kapor agreed to fund any legal fees associated with such a defense and the pair contacted New York lawyers Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky and Lieberman about defending several computer hackers from a ''Harper's'' magazine forum on computers and freedom who had been the target of [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] raids.<ref name="j1">{{Harvnb|Jones|2003|p=172}}</ref> This generated a large amount of publicity which led to offers of financial support from [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]] and [[Steve Wozniak]]. Barlow and Kapor continued to research conflicts between the government and technology and in June 1990, Barlow posted online the influential article entitled "Crime & Puzzlement" in which Barlow announced his and Kapor's plans to create an organization to "raise and disburse funds for education, lobbying, and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the Constitution into Cyberspace."<ref>{{cite web |title=Crime & Puzzlement |last=Barlow |first=John Perry |author-link=John Perry Barlow |date=June 8, 1990 |url=https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=August 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024192834/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html |archive-date=2014-10-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>

This generated further reaction and support for the ideas of Barlow and Kapor. In late June, Barlow held a series of dinners in [[San Francisco]] with major figures in the computer industry to develop a coherent response to these perceived threats. Barlow considered that: "The actions of the FBI and Secret Service were symptoms of a growing social crisis: Future Shock. America was entering the Information Age with neither laws nor metaphors for the appropriate protection and conveyance of information itself."<ref name="barlow-history">{{cite web |url= https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/not_too_brief_history.html |title=A Not Terribly Brief History of the Electronic Frontier Foundation |first=John |last=Barlow |date=November 8, 1990 |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=December 12, 2015}}</ref> Barlow felt that to confront this a formal organization would be needed; he hired Cathy Cook as press coordinator, and began to set up what would become the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formally founded on July 10, 1990, by Kapor and Barlow, who very soon after elected Gilmore, Wozniak, and [[Stewart Brand]] to join them on the Board of Directors.<ref name="barlow-history" />  Initial funding was provided by Kapor, Wozniak, and an anonymous benefactor.<ref name="mission">{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/?f=eff_creation.html |title=Formation documents and mission statement for the EFF |date=July 10, 1990 |last1=Kapor |first1=Mitch |author1-link=Mitch Kapor |last2=Barlow |first2=John Perry |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204082735/http://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/?f=eff_creation.html |archive-date=2015-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://weblogsky.com/technopolitics.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061110200326/http://www.weblogsky.com/technopolitics.htm |archive-date=November 10, 2006 |title=TechnoPolitics |first=Jon |last=Lebkowsky |author-link=Jon Lebkowsky |date=January 11, 1997 |website=Weblogsky |access-date=September 11, 2012}}</ref>

In 1990, [[Mike Godwin]] joined the organization as its first staff counsel. Then in 1991, [[Esther Dyson]] and [[Jerry Berman]] joined the EFF board of directors. By 1992, Cliff Figallo became the director of the original office, and in December 1992, Jerry Berman became the acting executive director of the organization as a whole, based in a new second office.

===Early cases===
The creation of the organization was motivated by the massive [[search and seizure]] on [[Steve Jackson Games]] executed by the [[United States Secret Service]] early in 1990. Similar but officially unconnected law-enforcement raids were being conducted across the United States at about that time as part of a state–federal task force called [[Operation Sundevil]]. [[GURPS Cyberpunk]], one of the game company's projects, was mistakenly labeled as a handbook for computer crime,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/SS/|title=SJ Games vs. the Secret Service|website=www.sjgames.com|access-date=2018-05-27}}</ref> and the Secret Service raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games. The [[search warrant]] for the raid was deemed hastily issued, and the games company soon after claimed unauthorized access as well as tampering of their emails. While phone calls were protected by legislation, digital emails were an early concept and had not been considered to fall under the right to personal privacy. The [[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service|Steve Jackson Games case]] was EFF's first high-profile case, was the major rallying point around which EFF began promoting computer- and Internet-related civil liberties.<ref>{{Citation|title=Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. US Secret Service|date=October 31, 1994|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3765716184001998475|volume=36|pages=457|accessdate=2018-05-27}}</ref>

EFF's second big case was ''[[Bernstein v. United States]]'' led by [[Cindy Cohn]], in which programmer and professor [[Daniel J. Bernstein]] sued the government for permission to publish his [[encryption]] software, Snuffle, and a paper describing it. More recently, the organization has been involved in defending [[Edward Felten]], [[Jon Lech Johansen]] and [[Dmitry Sklyarov]].

===Expansion and development===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Electronic Frontier Foundation 20th anniversary mecha poster.jpg|thumb|In early 2010, EFF released this poster in celebration of its founding 20 years before.]]

The organization was originally located at Mitch Kapor's Kapor Enterprises offices.<ref name=harris2002>{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Scott |authorlink= |date=2002 |title=Freedom Fighters of the Digital World |url=http://www.latimes.com:80/features/printedition/magazine/la-000003207jan13.story |work=LA Times |location= |access-date=10 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020117210844/http://www.latimes.com:80/features/printedition/magazine/la-000003207jan13.story |archive-date=2002-01-17 |dead-url=yes }}</ref> 
By the fall of 1993, the main EFF offices were consolidated into a single office,<ref name=harris2002/> 
headed by Executive Director Jerry Berman. 
During this time, some of EFF's attention focused on [[Lobbying|influencing national policy]],<ref name=harris2002/> 
to the dislike of some of the members of the organization.<ref name=harris2002/><ref name=timberg2013>{{cite news |last=Timberg |first=Craig |authorlink= |date=2013 |title=Try as it might, anti-surveillance group can’t avoid Washington |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/try-as-it-might-anti-surveillance-group-cant-avoid-washington/2013/10/11/2e14c0a0-2142-11e3-b73c-aab60bf735d0_story.html |work=The Washington Post |location= |access-date=10 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012034255/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/try-as-it-might-anti-surveillance-group-cant-avoid-washington/2013/10/11/2e14c0a0-2142-11e3-b73c-aab60bf735d0_story.html |archive-date=2013-10-12 |dead-url=no }}</ref> 
In 1994, Berman parted ways with EFF and formed the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]],<ref name=harris2002/> 
while Drew Taubman briefly took the reins as executive director.

In 1995, under the auspices of Executive Director [[Lori Fena]], 
after some downsizing and in an effort to regroup and refocus on their base of support, 
the organization moved offices to San Francisco, California.<ref name=harris2002/><ref name=timberg2013/> 
There, it took up temporary residence at [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore's]] Toad Hall, 
and soon afterward moved into the Hamm's Building at 1550 Bryant St. 
After Fena moved onto the EFF board of directors for a while, 
the organization was led briefly by [[Tara Lemmey]], 
followed by Barry Steinhardt 
(who had come from the closely allied Technology and Liberty Program at the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], 
and eventually returned to the ACLU). 
Not long before EFF's move into new offices at 454 Shotwell St. in SF's Mission District, 
Mike Godwin departed, 
long-time Legal Director Shari Steele was appointed as executive director, 
and staff attorney [[Cindy Cohn]] became the legal director.

In the spring of 2006, EFF announced the opening of an office again in Washington, D.C., with two new staff attorneys.<ref>{{cite news |first=Declan |last=McCullagh |author-link=Declan McCullagh |title=EFF reaches out to D.C. with new office | date=2006-04-27 |website=News.CNet.com |publisher=CBS Interactive |url= http://news.cnet.com/2100-1028_3-6065860.html |access-date=September 11, 2012}}</ref> 
In 2012, EFF began a fundraising campaign for the renovation of a building located at 815 Eddy Street in San Francisco, to serve as its new headquarters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/pages/eff-eddy | title=The New EFF HQ |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=December 2, 2014}}</ref> 
The move was completed in April, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/04/eddy-street-era-begins |title=The Eddy Street Era Begins |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=2 December 2014}}</ref> 
On April 1, 2015, Shari Steele stepped down as Executive Director.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/shari-steele-legacy-digital-rights |title=Shari Steele: A Legacy of Digital Rights |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=10 April 2015}}</ref> 
Cindy Cohn became the new executive director, 
Corynne McSherry became the legal director, 
and Kurt Opsahl became the general counsel.

===DES cracker===
{{main|EFF DES cracker}}
By the mid-1990s the EFF was becoming seriously concerned about the refusal of the US Government to license any secure encryption product for export unless it utilized [[key escrow|key recovery]] and claims that governments could not decrypt information when protected by [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], continuing even after the public breaking of the code in the first of the [[DES Challenges]]. They coordinated and supported the construction of the ''EFF DES cracker'' (nicknamed Deep Crack), using special purpose hardware and software and costing only $210,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_descracker_pressrel.html |title=EFF DES Cracker Machine Brings Honesty to Crypto Debate |date=July 17, 1998 |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722025129/https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_descracker_pressrel.html |archive-date=2012-07-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_des_faq.html#sources |title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About the Electronic Frontier Foundation's 'DES Cracker' Machine |date=July 16, 1998 |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918165854/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_des_faq.html#sources |archive-date=2012-09-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>
This brought the record for breaking a message down to 56 hours on 17 July 1998 and to under 24 hours on 19 Jan 1999 (in conjunction with [[distributed.net]]).

The EFF published the plans and source code for the cracker.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cracking DES - Secrets of Encryption Research, Wiretap Politics & Chip Design|author=Electronic Frontier Foundation|isbn=978-1-56592-520-5|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|year=1998|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565925205.do}}</ref> Within four years the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] was standardized as a replacement for DES.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burr|first=William E.|date=2003|title=Selecting the advanced encryption standard.|url=http://users.tricity.wsu.edu/~tyson/stuff/Selecting_the_AES.pdf|journal=IEEE Security & Privacy|volume=99|pages=43–52|via=}}</ref>

===Litigation===
[[File:2010 RSA Conference - EFF booth.jpg|thumb|EFF booth at the 2010 RSA Conference]]
{{Main|List of litigation involving the Electronic Frontier Foundation}}
The EFF regularly brings and defends lawsuits at all levels of the US legal system in pursuit of its goals and objectives. The EFF has long taken a stance against [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|strategic lawsuits against public participation]] (SLAPP) as attempts to stymie free speech and advocated for effective anti-SLAPP legislation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Many of the most significant technology law cases have involved the EFF, including ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]'', ''[[Apple v. Does]]'', and others.

===Awards===

The EFF organizes two sets of awards to promote work in accordance with its goals and objectives:

The [[EFF Pioneer Award]]s are awarded annually to recognize individuals who in its opinion are "leaders who are extending freedom and innovation on the electronic frontier."<ref name="Eff Pioneer Awards Website">{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/awards/pioneer |title=EFF Pioneer Awards |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=September 11, 2012}}</ref> In 2017, the honorees were [[Chelsea Manning]], [[Mike Masnick]] and Annie Game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Whistleblower Chelsea Manning, Techdirt Founder Mike Masnick, and Free Expression Defender Annie Game Named Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award Winners|url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/whistleblower-chelsea-manning-techdirt-founder-mike-masnick-and-free-expression|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=31 August 2017|date=16 August 2017}}</ref>

The EFF Cooperative Computing Awards are a series of four awards meant "to encourage ordinary Internet users to contribute to solving huge scientific problems," to be awarded to the first individual or group who discovers a prime number with a significant record number of decimal digits.

===Patent Busting Project===

The [[Patent Busting Project]] is an Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) initiative challenging patents that the organization claims are illegitimate and suppress innovation or limit online expression. The initiative launched on April 19, 2004 and involves two phases: documenting the damage caused by these patents, and submitting challenges to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO).

===Publications===
EFF publishes through several outlets such as the online periodical ''EFFector'' (ISSN 1062-9424),<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.eff.org/effector/ |title=EFFector |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |issn=1062-9424 |via=EFF.org |access-date=October 9, 2013}}</ref> as well as its websites, blogs, and on social networking services.

EFF's first book was published in 1993 as ''The Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet'', a beginners' how-to manual by contracted [[Technical writing|technical writer]] Adam Gaffin, and made available for free download in many formats. [[MIT Press]] published it in paperback form in 1994 as ''Everybody's Guide to the Internet'' ({{ISBN|9780262571050}}). The online edition was updated regularly throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, and translated into dozens of languages.

The organization's second book, ''Protecting Yourself Online'' ({{ISBN|9780062515124}}), an overview of digital civil liberties, was written in 1998 by technical writer Robert B. Gelman and EFF Communications Director Stanton McCandlish, and published by [[HarperCollins]].

A third book, ''Cracking DES: Secrets of Encryption Research, Wiretap Politics & Chip Design'' ({{ISBN|9781565925205}}), focusing on EFF's DES Cracker project, was published the same year by [[O'Reilly Media]].

A digital book, ''[[Pwn]]ing Tomorrow'', an [[anthology]] of [[speculative fiction]], was produced in 2015 as part of EFF's 25th anniversary activities, and includes contributions from 22 writers, including [[Charlie Jane Anders]], [[Paolo Bacigalupi]], [[Lauren Beukes]], [[David Brin]], [[Pat Cadigan]], [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Eileen Gunn]], [[Kameron Hurley]], [[James Patrick Kelly]], [[Ramez Naam]], [[Annalee Newitz]], [[Hannu Rajaniemi]], [[Rudy Rucker]], [[Lewis Shiner]], [[Bruce Sterling]], and [[Charles Yu]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/eff-publishes-pwning-tomorrow-speculative-fiction-anthology |title=EFF Publishes 'Pwning Tomorrow,' a Speculative Fiction Anthology |first=Dave |last=Maass |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |date=December 16, 2015 |access-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref>

The Electronic Frontier Foundation's [[blog]], ''DeepLinks'', is a major section of its main website at EFF.org.

The EFF sent a video message of support to global grassroots movement [[CryptoParty]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/cryptopartymelb |dead-url=yes |title=Message from EFF San Francisco to Cryptoparty Melbourne |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |via=YouTube |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130719171319/https://www.youtube.com/cryptopartymelb |archive-date=July 19, 2013 |access-date=July 17, 2013}}</ref>

=== Recent activism ===
The EFF was active in the [[United States presidential election 2016]] because of online [[phishing]] related to the controversy over [[Lie#Fabrication|fabrication]] of election results. [[J. Alex Halderman]], a computer security professor at the [[University of Michigan]], wrote an article that was published in [[Medium (website)|''Medium'']] in 2016 stating he thought it was advisable to have a recount on some of the election results from states like [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], and [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@jhalderm/want-to-know-if-the-election-was-hacked-look-at-the-ballots-c61a6113b0ba|title=Want to Know if the Election was Hacked? Look at the Ballots|last=Halderman|first=J. Alex|date=November 23, 2016|website=Medium|access-date=}}</ref> In retaliation for Halderman standing up for the uncertain election results, a hacker sent [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and [[Racism|racist]] emails to students at University of Michigan signed from Halderman. The EFF publicizes these controversies and promotes the reduction of online phishing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/not-okay-professor-smeared-after-advocating-election-integrity|title=Not Okay: Professor Smeared After Advocating for Election Integrity|last=Williams|first=Jamie|date=February 13, 2017|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=}}</ref>

==Software==
The EFF has developed some software and browser add-ons, including [[Switzerland (software)|Switzerland]], [[HTTPS Everywhere]], and [[Privacy Badger]].

=== Secure Messaging Scorecard ===
The EFF has also conducted a project named Secure Messaging Scorecard which "evaluated apps and tools based on a set of seven specific criteria ranging from whether messages were encrypted in transit to whether or not the code had been recently audited."<ref name="auto">{{cite web|title=Secure Messaging Scorecard|url=https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard|publisher=EFF|accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> Version 1.0 is accessible [https://www.eff.org/node/82654 here]. {{as of|2017|April|21|df=US}}, a revised version is under development.<ref name="auto"/>

==Support==

[[Charity Navigator]] has given the EFF an overall rating of four out of four stars, including four stars for its financial efficiency and capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=7576 |title=Electronic Frontier Foundation: Overall Score and Rating |work=[[Charity Navigator]] |access-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref>

EFF {{as of|2014|lc=y}} had $23 million in assets,<ref name=FY2014/> having received multiple grants or donations above 1 million dollars in its history. On February 18, 2004, the EFF announced that it had received a [[bequest]] of [[United States dollar|US$]]1.2 million from the estate of EFF member Leonard Zubkoff, a software developer and entrepreneur.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://w2.eff.org/effector/17/5.php#VI |title=Internet Pioneer Gives Over $1.2 Million to EFF to Defend Online Freedom |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=December 8, 2011}}</ref> It used $1 million of this money to establish the EFF Endowment Fund for Digital Civil Liberties.

Beginning in 2010, the EFF began regularly receiving income from the [[Humble Indie Bundle]]. In 2010, these donations made up 14% of EFF's total revenue.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/humble-indie-bundle-epic-win-creators-customers |title=The Humble Indie Bundle: Epic Win for Creators, Customers, and Digital Civil Liberties |first=Richard |last=Esguerra |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |date=July 28, 2011 |access-date=May 19, 2013}}</ref>  Between 2011 and 2014, the amount received from [[Humble Bundle]] reached $7.5 million or 23% of the EFF total revenues.<ref name="FY2014">{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/files/2015/08/06/2014_statement_of_activities.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement of Activities: July 2013 – June 2014 |date=2014 |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name="FY2013">{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/files/2014/10/29/2013_statement_of_activities.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement of Activities: July 2012 – June 2012 |date=2013 |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name="FY2012">{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/files/2014/10/29/2012_statement_of_activities.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement of Activities: July 2011 – June 2012 |date=2012 |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref>

In 2011, the EFF received $1 million from [[Google]] as part of a settlement of a class action related to privacy issues involving [[Google Buzz]].
The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] and seven other privacy-focused nonprofits protested that the plaintiffs' lawyers and Google had, in effect, arranged to give the majority of those funds "to organizations that are currently paid by Google to lobby for or to consult for the company." An additional $1 million was obtained from [[Facebook]] in a similar settlement.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/07/30/google-and-facebooks-new-tactic-in-the-tech-wars/ |title=Google and Facebook's new tactic in the tech wars |last=Parloff |first=Roger |date=July 30, 2012 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |publisher=Time, Inc. |access-date=December 3, 2014}}</ref>

==Criticism==
[[Yasha Levine]], writing for magazine ''[[The Baffler]]'', described the EFF as [[Astroturfing|astroturf]] created and funded by [[Silicon Valley]], stating they don't actually defend rights for the users of Internet platforms, instead defending large Internet companies (which are, according to him, EFF's biggest benefactors) by lobbying for said companies' interests and deviating attention from their business practices (especially regarding [[copyright]] and [[privacy]]) to government practices regarding privacy and [[censorship]], as well as actually [[lobbying in the United States|lobbying]] in ways that actively harm Internet users.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Levine |first=Yasha |date=July 2018 |author-link=Yasha Levine |title=All EFF’d Up |url=https://thebaffler.com/salvos/all-effd-up-levine |magazine=[[The Baffler]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=The Baffler Foundation |issue=40 |access-date=July 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720153706/https://thebaffler.com/salvos/all-effd-up-levine |archive-date=July 20, 2018 |dead-url=no}}</ref>
