'''Napster''' is the name given to three music-focused online services. It was founded as a pioneering [[peer-to-peer file sharing|peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing]] [[Internet]] service that emphasized sharing [[digital audio]] files, typically audio songs, encoded in [[MP3]] format. The company ran into legal difficulties over [[copyright infringement]].  It ceased operations and was eventually acquired by [[Roxio]]. In its second incarnation, Napster became an [[online music store]] until it was acquired by [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] from [[Best Buy]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Sisario |first=Ben |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/rhapsody-to-acquire-napster-in-deal-with-best-buy/ |title=Rhapsody to Acquire Napster in Deal With Best Buy - NYTimes.com |location=United States |publisher=Mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2011-10-03 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref> on December 1, 2011.

Later, more decentralized projects followed Napster's P2P file sharing example, such as [[Gnutella]], [[Freenet]], and [[BearShare]]. However, some services, like [[LimeWire]], [[Scour Inc.|Scour]], [[Kazaa]], [[Grokster]], [[Madster]], and [[eDonkey2000]], were brought down or changed due to copyright issues.

==Origin==
Napster was founded by [[Shawn Fanning]] and [[Sean Parker]].<ref name=wiredspotify>Pollack, Neal.

==History==
Although there were already networks that facilitated the distribution of files across the Internet, such as [[IRC]], [[Hotline Communications|Hotline]], and [[Usenet]], Napster specialized in MP3 files of music and a user-friendly interface. At its peak the Napster service had about 80 million registered users.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/22380/requiem_napster/ | title=Requiem for Napster | publisher=Pcworld.com | date=2002-05-18 | accessdate=2013-06-13 | last=Gowan | first=Michael}}</ref> Napster made it relatively easy for music enthusiasts to download copies of songs that were otherwise difficult to obtain, such as older songs, unreleased recordings, studio recordings, and songs from concert bootleg recordings.

High-speed networks in college dormitories became overloaded, with as much as 61% of external network traffic consisting of MP3 file transfers.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.isp-planet.com/politics/napster.html | title=The Napster Nightmare | publisher=ISP-Planet | date=March 13, 2000 | last=Fusco | first=Patricia | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019152028/http://www.isp-planet.com/politics/napster.html | archivedate=2011-10-19}}</ref> Many colleges blocked its use for this reason,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/942090.stm | title=Napster expelled by universities | publisher=BBC News | date=September 26, 2000 | last=Anderson | first=Kevin | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021085514/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/942090.stm | archivedate=2007-10-21}}</ref> even before concerns about liability for facilitating copyright violations on campus.

===Macintosh version===
[[Image:Napster running on an original iBook (2001-03-11).png|right|thumb|Napster running under Mac OS 9 in March 2001.]]
The service and software program began as [[Windows]]-only. However, in 2000, Black Hole Media wrote a Macintosh client called Macster. Macster was later bought by Napster and designated the official Mac Napster client ("Napster for the Mac"), at which point the Macster name was discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macobserver.com/article/2000/10/25.2.shtml|title=Official Napster Client For Mac OS, OS X -- The Mac Observer|work=macobserver.com}}</ref>  Even before the acquisition of Macster, the Macintosh community had a variety of independently-developed Napster clients. The most notable was the   open [[open source software|source]] client called MacStar, released by Squirrel Software in early 2000 and Rapster, released by Overcaster Family in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/players.shtml | title=Eight MP3 Players For The Macintosh | publisher=Applelinks | accessdate=April 26, 2014 | author=Moore, Charles W. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112184840/http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/players.shtml | archivedate=November 12, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>  The release of MacStar's source code paved the way for third-party Napster clients across all computing platforms, giving users advertisement-free music distribution options.

===Legal challenges===
Heavy metal band [[Metallica]] discovered a demo of their song "[[I Disappear]]" had been circulating across the network before it was released. This led to it being played on several radio stations across the United States and alerted Metallica to the fact that their entire back catalogue of studio material was also available. On March 13, 2000, they filed a [[Metallica v. Napster, Inc.|lawsuit against Napster]]. A month later, rapper and producer [[Dr. Dre]], who shared a litigator and legal firm with Metallica, filed a similar lawsuit after Napster refused his written request to remove his works from its service. Separately, Metallica and Dr. Dre later delivered to Napster thousands of usernames of people who they believed were pirating their songs. In March 2001, Napster settled both suits, after being shut down by the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in a separate lawsuit from several major record labels (see below).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/522098 |title=Conflict and Compromise: Drama in Marketplace Evolution |year=2008 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=739–753|url=http://visionarymarketing.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/giesler2007jcr.pdf }}</ref> In 2000, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s [[Single (music)|single]] "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]" was leaked out onto the web and Napster prior to its commercial release, causing widespread media coverage.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.com/2100-1023-241341.html?legacy=cnet | title=Unreleased Madonna Single Slips On To Net | publisher=CNET News.com | date=June 1, 2000 | last=Borland | first=John | archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120628232111/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-241341.html | archivedate=June 28, 2012 | deadurl=yes | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Verified Napster use peaked with 26.4 million users worldwide in February 2001.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?id=249 | title=GLOBAL NAPSTER USAGE PLUMMETS, BUT NEW FILE-SHARING ALTERNATIVES GAINING GROUND, REPORTS JUPITER MEDIA METRIX | publisher=comScore | date=2001-07-20 | accessdate=April 26, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413104420/http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?id=249 | archivedate=2008-04-13}}</ref>

In 2000, the American musical recording company [[A&M Records]] along with several other recording companies, through the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), sued Napster (''[[A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.]]'') on grounds of contributory and vicarious copyright infringement under the US [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA).<ref>17 U.S.C. A&M Records. Inc. v. Napster. Inc. 114 F. Supp. 2d 896 (N. D. Cal. 2000).</ref> Napster was faced with the following allegations from the music industry:

# That its users were directly violating the plaintiffs' copyrights.
# That Napster was responsible for contributory infringement of the plaintiffs' copyrights.
# That Napster was responsible for vicarious infringement of the plaintiffs' copyrights.

Napster lost the case in the District Court but then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Although it was clear that Napster could have commercially significant non-infringing uses, the Ninth Circuit upheld the District Court's decision. Immediately after, the District Court commanded Napster to keep track of the activities of its network and to restrict access to infringing material when informed of that material's location. Napster wasn't able to comply and thus had to close down its service in July 2001. In 2002, Napster announced that it was bankrupt and sold its assets to a third party.<ref>.A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001).

===Promotional power===
[[Image:Napster Unique Users.svg|thumb|right|300px|Napster peaked in February 2001.]]

Along with the accusations that Napster was hurting the sales of the record industry, there were those who felt just the opposite, that file trading on Napster stimulated, rather than hurt, sales. Some evidence may have come in July 2000 when tracks from [[England|English]] rock band [[Radiohead]]'s album ''[[Kid A]]'' found their way to Napster three months before the album's release. Unlike Madonna, Dr. Dre or Metallica, Radiohead had never hit the top 20 in the US. Furthermore, ''Kid A'' was an album without any [[single (music)|singles]] released, and received relatively little radio [[airplay]]. By the time of the album's release, the album was estimated to have been downloaded for free by millions of people worldwide, and in October 2000 ''Kid A'' captured the number one spot on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] sales chart in its debut week. According to [[Richard Menta]] of [[MP3 Newswire]],<ref>{{cite news | last=Menta | first=Richard | title=Did Napster Take Radiohead's New Album to Number 1? | date=October 28, 2000 | publisher=MP3 Newswire | url=http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/2000/radiohead.html}}</ref> the effect of Napster in this instance was isolated from other elements that could be credited for driving sales, and the album's unexpected success suggested that Napster was a good promotional tool for music.

Since 2000, many musical artists, particularly those not signed to major labels and without access to traditional mass media outlets such as radio and television, have said that Napster and successive Internet file-sharing networks have helped get their music heard, spread word of mouth, and may have improved their sales in the long term{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. One such musician to publicly defend Napster as a promotional tool for independent artists was [[Dj xealot]], who became directly involved in the 2000 A&M Records Lawsuit.<ref name="Declaration of D.J. Xealot in Supp. of. Napster">{{cite web |title=Case Nos.

===Lawsuit===
{{Main|A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.}}

Napster's facilitation of transfer of copyrighted material raised the ire of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), which almost immediately—on December 7, 1999—filed a [[lawsuit]] against the popular service.<ref>''[[A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.]]'', 114 F. Supp. 2d 896 ([[N.D. Cal.]] 2000), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 239 F.3d 1004 ([[9th Cir.]] 2001)</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Menta | first=Richard | title= RIAA Sues Music Startup Napster for $20 Billion | date=December 9, 1999 | publisher=MP3 Newswire | url=http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/napster.html}}</ref> The service would only get bigger as the trial, meant to shut down Napster, also gave it [[Streisand effect|a great deal of publicity]]. Soon millions of users, many of whom were college students, flocked to it.
After a failed appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court]], an injunction was issued on March 5, 2001 ordering Napster to prevent the trading of copyrighted music on its network.<ref>2001 US Dist. LEXIS 2186 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 5, 2001), aff’d, 284 F. 3d 1091 (9th Cir. 2002).</ref>

|isbn= 978-0-14-303465-0 |pages= 73–74 }}</ref> claimed, however, that this decision made little sense from the perspective of copyright protection:  "When Napster told the district court that it had developed a technology to block the transfer of 99.4 percent of identified infringing material, the district court told counsel for Napster 99.4 percent was not good enough.  Napster had to push the infringements 'down to zero.' If 99.4 percent is not good enough," Lessig concluded, "then this is a war on file-sharing technologies, not a war on copyright infringement."

===Shutdown===
On July 11, 2001, Napster shut down its entire network in order to comply with the injunction. On September 24, 2001, the case was partially settled. Napster agreed to pay music creators and copyright owners a $26 million settlement for past, unauthorized uses of music, and as an advance against future licensing royalties of $10 million. In order to pay those fees Napster attempted to convert its free service into a subscription system, and thus traffic to Napster was reduced. A prototype solution was tested in 2002: the Napster 3.0 Alpha, using the ".nap" secure file format from [[PlayMedia Systems]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/07/23/napster_to_ditch_mp3/|title=Napster to ditch MP3 for proprietary format|work=theregister.co.uk}}</ref> and audio fingerprinting technology licensed from [[Relatable]]. Napster 3.0 was, according to many former Napster employees, ready to deploy, but it had significant trouble obtaining licenses to distribute major-label music. On May 17, 2002, Napster announced that its assets would be acquired by German media firm [[Bertelsmann]] for $85 million with the goal of transforming Napster into an online music subscription service. The two companies had been collaborating since the middle of 2000<ref>{{Cite web

===2008–2016===
Napster's brand and logos were acquired at bankruptcy auction by [[Roxio]] which used them to re-brand the [[Pressplay]] music service as [[Napster (pay service)|Napster 2.0]].
