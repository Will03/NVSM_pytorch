'''Urban informatics''' refers to the study of people creating, applying and using [[information and communication technology]] and [[data]] in the context of [[cities]] and [[urban environments]]. Various definitions are available, some provided in the [[#Definitions|Definitions]] section. Urban informatics is a trans-disciplinary field of research and practice that draws on three broad domains: people, place and technology.<ref name="FothChoi2011" />

* People can refer to city residents, [[citizens]], [[community groups]], from various socio-cultural backgrounds, as well as the social dimensions of non-profit organisations and businesses. The social research domains that urban informatics draws from include [[urban sociology]], [[media studies]], [[communication studies]], [[cultural studies]], [[city planning]] and others.
* Place can refer to distinct urban sites, [[Locale (geographic)|locales]] and [[habitats]], as well as to larger scale geographic entities such as [[neighbourhoods]], [[public space]], [[suburbs]], [[regions]], or peri-urban areas. The place or spatial research domains entail [[urban studies]], [[architecture]], [[urban design]], [[urban planning]], [[geography]], and others.
* Technology can refer to various types of [[information and communication technology]] and [[ubiquitous computing]] / [[urban computing]] technology such as [[mobile phones]], [[wearable devices]], urban screens, media façades, [[sensors]], and other [[Internet of Things]] devices. The technology research domains span [[informatics]], [[computer science]], [[software engineering]], [[human-computer interaction]], and others.

In addition to [[geographic data]] / [[spatial data]], most common sources of data relevant to urban informatics can be divided into three broad categories: government data ([[census]] data, [[open data]], etc.); personal data ([[social media]], [[quantified self]] data, etc.), and; sensor data ([[transport]], [[surveillance]], [[CCTV]], Internet of Things devices, etc.).<ref name="kitchin2011" /><ref name="Street Computing 2012">{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Ricky|last2=Rittenbruch|first2=Markus|last3=Foth|first3=Marcus|last4=Filonik|first4=Daniel|last5=Viller|first5=Stephen|title=Street Computing: Towards an Integrated Open Data Application Programming Interface (API) for Cities|journal=Journal of Urban Technology|date=April 2012|volume=19|issue=2|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/10630732.2012.698064}}</ref>

Although first mentions of the term date back as early as 1987, urban informatics did not emerge as a notable field of research and practice until 2006 (see [[#History|History]] section). Since then, the emergence and growing popularity of ubiquitous computing, open data and [[big data analytics]], as well as [[smart cities]] contributed to a surge in interest in urban informatics, not just from academics but also from industry and city governments seeking to explore and apply the possibilities and opportunities of urban informatics.

== Definitions ==

Many definitions of urban informatics have been published and can be found online. The descriptions provided by Townsend in his foreword and by Foth in his preface to the "Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics"<ref name="foth2009">{{cite book|last1=Foth|first1=Marcus|title=Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics: The Practice and Promise of the Real-Time City|date=2009|publisher=Information Science Reference|location=Hershey, PA|isbn=978-1-60566-152-0|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/13308/}}</ref> emphasize two key aspects: (1) the new possibilities (including real-time data) for both citizens and city administrations afforded by [[ubiquitous computing]], and (2) the convergence of physical and digital aspects of the city.

{{Quotation|"Urban informatics is the study, design, and practice of urban experiences across different urban contexts that are created by new opportunities of real-time, ubiquitous technology and the augmentation that mediates the physical and digital layers of people networks and urban infrastructures."|Foth, Choi, Satchell, 2011|Urban Informatics<ref name="FothChoi2011">{{cite conference|first1=Marcus|last1=Foth|first2=Jaz Hee-jeong|last2=Choi|first3=Christine|last3=Satchell|title=Urban Informatics|conference=Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)|pages=1–8|date=2011|location=Hangzhou, China|doi=10.1145/1958824.1958826}}</ref>}}

Although closely related, Foth differentiates urban informatics from the field of [[urban computing]] by suggesting that the former focusses more on the social and human implications of technology in cities (similar to the community and social emphases of how [[community informatics]] and [[social informatics]] are defined), and the latter focusses more on technology and computing.<ref name="foth2009" /> Urban informatics emphasises the relationship between urbanity, as expressed through the many dimensions of urban life, and technology.

Later, with the increasing popularity of commercial opportunities under the label of [[smart city]] and [[big data]], subsequent definitions became narrow and limited in defining urban informatics mainly as [[big data analytics]] for efficiency and productivity gains in city contexts – unless the arts and social sciences are added to the interdisciplinary mix.<ref name="thrift">{{cite journal|last1=Thrift|first1=Nigel|title=The Promise of Urban Informatics: Some Speculations|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=2014|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1263–1266|doi=10.1068/a472c}}</ref> This specialisation within urban informatics is sometimes referred to as 'data-driven, [[Urbanism#Network-based theories|networked urbanism]]'<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kitchin|first1=Rob|title=Data-Driven, Networked Urbanism|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=2015|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2641802|ssrn=2641802}}</ref> or [[urban science]].<ref name="batty">{{cite book|last1=Batty|first1=Michael|title=The New Science of Cities|date=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780262019521|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-science-cities}}</ref>

== History ==

One of the first occurrences of the term can be found in Mark E. Hepworth's 1987 article "The Information City",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hepworth|first1=Mark E.|title=The Information City|journal=Cities|date=August 1987|volume=4|issue=3|pages=253–262|doi=10.1016/0264-2751(87)90033-3}}</ref> which mentions the term "urban informatics" on page 261, however, Hepworth's overall discussion is more concerned with the broader notion of "informatics planning." Considering the article pre-dates the advent of ubiquitous computing and urban computing, it does contain some visionary thoughts about major changes on the horizon brought about by [[information and communication technology]] and the impact on cities.

The Urban Informatics Research Lab was founded at [[Queensland University of Technology]] in 2006, the first research group explicitly named to reflect its dedication to the study of urban informatics.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The first edited book on the topic, the "Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics", published in 2009.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, brought together researchers and scholars from three broad domains: people, place, and technology, or; the social, the spatial, and the technical.

There were many precursors to this [[transdisciplinarity]] of "people, place, and technology."<ref name="FothChoi2011" /> From an [[architecture]], [[planning]] and [[design]] background, there is the work of the late [[William J. Mitchell]], Dean of the [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning]], and author of the 1995 book "City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=William J.|title=City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn|date=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-13309-8|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/city-bits}}</ref> Mitchell was influential in suggesting a profound relationship between place and technology at a time when mainstream interest was focused on the promise of the [[Information Superhighway]] and what [[Frances Cairncross]] called the "Death of Distance."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cairncross|first1=Frances|title=The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution will Change our Lives|date=1997|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=978-0-87584-806-8}}</ref> Rather than a decline in the significance of place through services such as [[telecommuting]], [[distance education]], [[e-commerce]], the physical / tangible layers of the city started to mix with the digital layers of the internet and online communications. Aspects of this trend have been studied under the terms community informatics<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gurstein|first1=Michael|title=Community Informatics: Enabling Communities with Information and Communications Technologies|date=2000|publisher=Idea Group Publishing|location=Hershey, PA|isbn=978-1-878289-69-8}}</ref> and [[community network]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schuler|first1=Douglas|title=Community Networks: New Community Networks: Wired for Change|date=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Mass.|isbn=978-0-201-59553-6}}</ref>

One of the first texts that systematically examined the impact of information technologies on the spatial and social evolution of cities is Telecommunications and the City: Electronic Spaces, Urban Places,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen|last2=Marvin|first2=Simon|title=Telecommunications and the City: Electronic Spaces, Urban Places.|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}</ref> by Stephen Graham and Simon Marvin. The relationship between cities and the internet was further expanded upon in a volume edited by Stephen Graham entitled "Cybercities Reader"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen|title=The Cybercities Reader|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-27956-7}}</ref> and by various authors in the 2006 book "Networked Neighbourhoods: The Connected Community in Context"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Purcell|first1=Patrick|title=Networked Neighbourhoods: The Connected Community in Context|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=London|isbn=978-1-84628-267-6|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781846282676}}</ref> edited by Patrick Purcell. Additionally, contributions from architecture, design and planning scholars are contained in the 2007 journal special issue on "Space, Sociality, and Pervasive Computing"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dave|first1=Bharat|title=Space, Sociality, and Pervasive Computing|journal=Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design|date=2007|volume=34|issue=3|pages=381–382|doi=10.1068/b3403ed}}</ref> published in the journal Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 34(3), guest edited by the late Bharat Dave, as well as in the 2008 book "Augmented Urban Spaces: Articulating the Physical and Electronic City"<ref name="aurigi2008">{{cite book|last1=Aurigi|first1=Alessandro|last2=De Cindio|first2=Fiorella|title=Augmented Urban Spaces: Articulating the Physical and Electronic City|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|isbn=978-0-7546-7149-7}}</ref> edited by Alessandro Aurigi and Fiorella De Cindio, based on contributions to the Digital Cities 4 workshop held in conjunction with the Communities and Technologies (C&T) conference 2005 in Milan, Italy.

The first prominent and explicit use of the term urban informatics in the [[sociology]] and [[media studies]] literature appears in the 2007 special issue "Urban Informatics: Software, Cities and the New Cartographies of Knowing Capitalism"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ellison|first1=Nick|last2=Burrows|first2=Roger|last3=Parker|first3=Simon|title=Urban Informatics: Software, Cities and the New Cartographies of Knowing Capitalism|journal=Information, Communication & Society|date=December 2007|volume=10|issue=6|pages=785–788|doi=10.1080/13691180701750975}}</ref> published in the journal Information, Communication & Society, 10(6), guest edited by Ellison, Burrows, & Parker. Later on, in 2013, Burrows and Beer argued that the socio-technical transformations described by research studies conducted in the field of urban informatics give reason for sociologists more broadly to not only question epistemological and methodological norms and practices but also to rethink spatial assumptions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burrows|first1=Roger|last2=Beer|first2=David|editor1-last=Orton-Johnson|editor1-first=Kate|editor2-last=Prior|editor2-first=Nick|title=Digital Sociology: Critical Perspectives|chapter=Rethinking Space: Urban Informatics and the Sociological Imagination|date=2013| pages=61–78|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-230-22283-0|doi=10.1057/9781137297792_5}}</ref>

In [[computer science]], the sub-domains of [[human-computer interaction]], ubiquitous computing, and urban computing, provided early contributions that influenced the emerging field of urban informatics. Examples include the Digital Cities workshop series (see below), Greenfield’s 2006 book "Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing|last=Greenfield|first=Adam|publisher=New Riders|year=2006|isbn=0321384016|location=San Francisco, US|pages=|via=}}</ref> as well as the 2006 special issue "Urban Computing: Navigating Space and Context"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shklovski|first1=Irina|last2=Chang|first2=M.

== Digital Cities Workshop Series ==

The Digital Cities Workshop Series started in 1999<ref name="dc1" /> and is the longest running academic workshop series that has focused on, and profoundly influenced the field of urban informatics.<ref name="foth2015" /> The first two workshops in 1999 and 2001 were both held in Kyoto, Japan, with subsequent workshops since 2003 held in conjunction with the biennial International Conference on Communities and Technologies (C&T).

Each Digital Cities workshop proceedings have become the basis for key anthologies listed below, which in turn have also been formative to a diverse set of emerging fields, including urban informatics, urban computing, smart cities, [[pervasive computing]], [[internet of things]], media architecture, urban [[interaction design]], and urban science.

== Methods ==

The diverse range of people, groups and organisations involved in urban informatics is reflective of the diversity of methods being used in its pursuit and practice. As a result, urban informatics borrows from a wide range of methodologies across the [[social sciences]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[design]], [[architecture]], [[planning]] (including [[geographic information systems]]), and [[technology]] (in particular [[computer science]], pervasive computing, and ubiquitous computing), and applies those to the urban domain. Examples include:

* [[action research]] and [[participatory action research]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hearn|first1=Greg|last2=Tacchi|first2=Jo|last3=Foth|first3=Marcus|last4=Lennie|first4=June|title=Action Research and New Media: Concepts, Methods, and Cases|date=2009|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|isbn=978-1-57273-866-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Foth|first1=Marcus|last2=Brynskov|first2=Martin|editor1-last=Gordon|editor1-first=Eric|editor2-last=Mihailidis|editor2-first=Paul|title=Civic Media: Technology, Design, Practice|chapter=Participatory Action Research for Civic Engagement|date=2016|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-03427-2|pages=563–580}}</ref>
