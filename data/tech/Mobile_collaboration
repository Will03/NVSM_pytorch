'''Mobile collaboration''' is a technology-based process of communicating using electronic assets and accompanying software designed for use in remote locations. Newest generation hand-held electronic devices feature video, audio, and telestration (on-screen drawing) capabilities broadcast over secure networks, enabling multi-party conferencing in real time (although real time communication is not a strict requirement of mobile collaboration and may not be applicable or practical in many collaboration scenarios).

Differing from traditional [[videoconferencing|video conferencing]], mobile collaboration utilizes [[wireless]], [[Cellular network|cellular]] and [[broadband]] technologies enabling effective [[collaboration]] independent of location. Where traditional video conferencing has been limited to boardrooms, offices, and lecture theatres, [[recent technological advancements]] have extended the capabilities of video conferencing for use with discreet, [[Mobile device|hand-held mobile devices]], permitting true mobile collaborative possibilities.<ref>{{cite news

== Scope ==
The scope of mobile collaboration takes into account a number of elements that continue to evolve in their sophistication and complexity: video, audio and telestration capabilities, conferencing and [[telepresence]] systems, collaboration tools, [[Data transmission|transmission]] technologies, and mobility.

== Forecasts ==
[[Cisco Systems]] predicts "two-thirds of the world's mobile data traffic will be video by 2015."<ref>{{cite news

No segment is growing faster than mobile communications, and virtually every [[Smartphone|smart phone]] will be equipped with [[Videotelephony|video chat]], [[Instant Messaging|IM]], directory, and other UC features within a few years."<ref>{{cite news

This can be done in real time with advanced video, audio and telestrator capabilities, comparable to working together in the same room but without the associated expense and downtime typically involved in getting the experts to remote locations.<ref>{{cite news

=== Manufacturing ===
Manufacturers of all kinds use mobile collaboration technology in a number of ways. Recent trends in [[globalization]] and [[outsourcing]] in particular, have meant that companies need to communicate with employees, suppliers, and customers the world over.<ref>{{cite news

=== Energy ===
Companies in the energy sector face unique challenges due to, for example, the vast distances between a head office and the remote, harsh environment of an offshore oil rig, as well as the often inadequacies or absence of  necessary transmission networks. Recent advancements in mobile collaboration technology and transmission networks are making it possible for employees in these situations to collaborate in secure and reliable ways with colleagues thousands of miles away. The use of mobile collaboration in the energy sector is enabling companies to conduct remote inspections, safety audits, maintenance, repair and overhaul work, as well as IT/communication infrastructure troubleshooting.<ref>{{cite news

=== Healthcare ===
Although [[telemedicine]] technology has been in use for a number of years in the healthcare sector, mobile collaboration technology extends these capabilities to locations now reachable through the use of hand-held devices such as a remote community, long-term care facility, or a patient’s home. Healthcare professionals in multiple locations can together view, discuss, and assess patient issues. The use of mobile collaboration technology within the healthcare sector has the potential to improve the quality and access to care, while making its delivery more cost-effective.<ref>{{cite news

=== Education ===
Mobile collaboration technology might also be used for remote education. From one on one tutoring to large classes it has many uses. Homeschooling could really benefit from this technology as you participate in a lecture from anywhere in the world. Most useful you can record your classes or lectures and review them. Internet schools, including higher education, will most certainly also benefit from this development in mobile education. Though these methods are not widely used they are quite useful and most likely will become widely popular.<ref>{{cite news

== Franchise businesses ==
Mobile collaboration between franchiser and franchisee allows modern technology to be used to allow a better flow of communications similar to face-to-face, albeit remotely via video/voice media such as smartphones, tablets, iPhones, iPads, etc. to be collectively used without requiring one party to travel to another location.  This in turn reduces travel time and expenses not to mention better and quicker modes of communication.

Franchisers who have several hundred franchisees find it an absolute must.<ref>{{cite news
