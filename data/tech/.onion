'''.onion''' is a special-use [[top level domain]] suffix designating an anonymous [[onion service]] (formerly known as a "hidden service"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winter |first1=Philipp |title=How Do Tor Users Interact With Onion Services? |url=https://nymity.ch/onion-services/pdf/sec18-onion-services.pdf |accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref>) reachable via the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network. Such addresses are not actual [[DNS name]]s, and the .onion TLD is not in the [[DNS root zone|Internet DNS root]], but with the appropriate proxy software installed, Internet programs such as [[web browser]]s can access sites with .onion [[Url|addresses]] by sending the request through the network of Tor servers.

The purpose of using such a system is to make both the information provider and the person accessing the information more difficult to trace, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider. Sites that offer dedicated .onion addresses may provide an additional layer of identity assurance via [[Extended Validation Certificate|EV HTTPS Certificates]], and provision of an HTTP certificate also enables browser features which would otherwise be unavailable to users of .onion sites. Provision of an onion site also helps mitigate<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schuhmacher|first1=Sophie|title=Blockchain.Info Launches Darknet Site In Response To Thefts Over TOR|url=http://bravenewcoin.com/news/blockchain-info-launches-darknet-site-in-response-to-thefts-over-tor/|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=5 December 2014}}</ref> [[SSL stripping]] attacks by [[Tor (anonymity network)#Exit node eavesdropping|malicious exit nodes]] on the Tor network upon users who would otherwise access traditional HTTPS [[clearnet (networking)|clearnet]] sites over Tor.

== Format ==
Addresses in the .onion TLD are generally opaque, non-[[mnemonic]], 16- or 56-character<ref>{{cite web|title=Intro to Next Gen Onion Services (aka prop224)|url=https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/NextGenOnions|publisher=The Tor Project|accessdate=5 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=We Want You to Test Next-Gen Onion Services|url=https://blog.torproject.org/we-want-you-test-next-gen-onion-services|website=Tor Blog|publisher=The Tor Project|accessdate=5 May 2018}}</ref> alpha-semi-numerical strings which are automatically generated based on a [[public key]] when a [[Tor (anonymity network)#Onion services|onion service]] is configured. These strings can be made up of any letter of the alphabet, and decimal digits from 2 to 7, representing in [[base32]] either an 80-bit [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] ("version 2", or 16 character) or an [[EdDSA#Ed25519|ed25519]] public key ("version 3", "next gen", or 56-character). It is possible to set up a human-readable .onion URL (e.g. starting with an organization name) by generating massive numbers of [[public-key cryptography|key pairs]] (a computational process that can be [[parallelized]]) until a sufficiently desirable URL is found.<ref name="scallion">{{cite web | url=https://github.com/lachesis/scallion | title=Scallion | publisher=GitHub | accessdate=2014-11-02}}</ref><ref name="facebook url">{{cite mailing list | url=http://archives.seul.org/tor/talk/Oct-2014/msg00433.html | title=Re: Facebook brute forcing hidden services | publisher=Simple End-User Linux | mailinglist=tor-talk | date=2014-10-31 | accessdate=2014-11-02 | author=Muffett, Alec}}</ref>

The "onion" name refers to [[onion routing]], the technique used by Tor to achieve a degree of [[anonymity]].

== WWW to .onion gateways ==
Proxies into the Tor network like [[Tor2web]] allow access to onion services from non-Tor browsers and for search engines that are not Tor-aware. By using a gateway, users give up their own anonymity and trust the gateway to deliver the correct content. Both the gateway and the onion service can fingerprint the browser, and access user IP address data. Some proxies use caching techniques to provide better page-loading<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onion.cab/?a=why|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521220306/https://onion.cab/?a=why|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-05-21|title=Onion.cab: Advantages of this TOR2WEB-Proxy|accessdate=2014-05-21}}</ref> than the official [[Tor (anonymity network)#Tor Browser|Tor Browser]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en|title=Tor Browser Bundle|accessdate=2014-05-21}}</ref>

== .exit (defunct pseudo-top-level domain) ==
'''.exit''' was a [[pseudo-top-level domain]] used by [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] users to indicate on the fly to the Tor software the preferred [[Tor (anonymity network)#Anonymous outgoing connections|exit node]] that should be used while connecting to a service such as a [[World Wide Web|web server]], without having to edit the configuration file for Tor (''torrc'').

The syntax used with this domain was ''hostname'' + ''.exitnode'' + ''.exit'', so that a user wanting to connect to <nowiki>http://www.torproject.org/</nowiki> through node ''tor26'' would have to enter the URL ''<nowiki>http://www.torproject.org.tor26.exit</nowiki>''.

Example uses for this would include accessing a site available only to addresses of a certain country or checking if a certain node is working.

Users could also type ''exitnode.exit'' alone to access the IP address of ''exitnode''.

The .exit notation was deprecated as of version 0.2.9.8.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/ReleaseNotes |title=Tor Release Notes |accessdate=2017-10-04}}</ref> It is disabled by default as of version 0.2.2.1-alpha due to potential application-level attacks,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/address-spec.txt |title=Special Hostnames in Tor |accessdate=2012-06-30}}</ref> and with the release of 0.3-series Tor as "stable"<ref>{{cite web|title=Tor 0.3.2.9 is released: We have a new stable series!|url=https://blog.torproject.org/tor-0329-released-we-have-new-stable-series|publisher=The Tor Project|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref> may now be considered defunct.

== Official designation ==
The domain was formerly a [[pseudo-top-level domain]] host suffix, similar in concept to such endings as [[.bitnet]] and [[.uucp]] used in earlier times.

On 9 September 2015 [[ICANN]], [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] and the [[IETF]] designated .onion as a 'special use domain', giving the domain an official status following a proposal from [[Jacob Appelbaum]] of the Tor Project and [[Facebook]] security engineer [[Alec Muffett]].<ref name=lwn-iana>{{cite news |author=Nathan Willis |date={{date|2015-09-10}} |title=Tor's .onion domain approved by IETF/IANA |publisher=[[LWN.net]] |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/657056/ }}</ref><ref name="official">{{cite news|last1=Franceschi-Bicchierai|first1=Lorenzo|title=Internet Regulators Just Legitimized The Dark Web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/internet-regulators-just-legitimized-the-dark-web|accessdate=10 September 2015|date=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Special-Use Domain Names|url=https://www.iana.org/assignments/special-use-domain-names/special-use-domain-names.xhtml|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref>

== HTTPS support ==

Prior to the adoption of [[CA/Browser Forum]] Ballot 144, a [[HTTPS]] certificate for a .onion name could only be acquired by treating .onion as an Internal Server Name.<ref name="ballot144">{{cite web|title=CA/Browser Forum Ballot 144 - Validation rules for .onion names|url=https://cabforum.org/2015/02/18/ballot-144-validation-rules-dot-onion-names/|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> Per the CA/Browser Forum's Baseline Requirements, these certificates could be issued, but were required to expire before 1 November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management Publicly-Trusted Certificates, v1.0|url=https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/Baseline_Requirements_V1.pdf|accessdate=13 September 2015|format=PDF}}</ref>

Despite these restrictions, [[DuckDuckGo]] launched an onion site with a self-signed certificate in July 2013;<ref>{{cite web|title=We've updated our Tor hidden service to work over SSL.

Following the adoption of CA/Browser Forum Ballot 144 and the designation of the domain as 'special use' in September 2015, .onion meets the criteria for [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761 RFC 6761].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Arkko|first1=Jari|title=.onion|url=https://www.ietf.org/blog/2015/09/onion/|accessdate=13 September 2015|date=10 September 2015}}</ref>  Certificate authorities may issue SSL certificates for HTTPS .onion sites per the process documented in the [[CA/Browser Forum]]'s Baseline Requirements,<ref>{{cite web|title=Baseline Requirements Documents|url=https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> introduced in Ballot 144.<ref name="ballot144"/>

As of August 2016, 13 onion domains are https signed across 7 different organisations via [[DigiCert]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jamie Lewis|first1=Sarah|title=OnionScan Report: July 2016 - HTTPS Somewhere Sometimes|url=https://mascherari.press/onionscan-report-july-2016-https-somewhere-sometimes/|accessdate=15 August 2016|date=7 August 2016}}</ref>
