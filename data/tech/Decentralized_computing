'''Decentralized computing''' is the allocation of resources, both [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]], to each individual [[workstation]], or office location. In contrast, centralized computing exists when the majority of functions are carried out, or obtained from a remote centralized location. Decentralized computing is a trend in modern-day business environments. This is the opposite of [[centralized computing]], which was prevalent during the early days of computers. 
A decentralized computer system has many benefits over a conventional centralized [[Computer network|network]]. [[Desktop computer]]s have advanced so rapidly, that their potential performance far exceeds the requirements of most [[business application]]s. This results in most desktop computers remaining [[Idle (CPU)|idle]] (in relation to their full potential). A decentralized system can use the potential of these systems to maximize efficiency. However, it is debatable whether these networks increase overall effectiveness.

All computers have to be updated individually with new software, unlike a centralised computer system. Decentralised systems still enable [[file sharing]] and all computers can share [[peripherals]] such as [[Computer printer|printers]] and [[Image scanner|scanners]] as well as [[modems]], allowing all the computers in the network to connect to the [[internet]].

A collection of decentralized computers systems are components of a larger computer network, held together by local stations of equal importance and capability. These systems are capable of running independently of each other.

== Origins of decentralized computing ==
The origins of decentralized computing originate from the work of [[David Chaum]]. 

During 1979 he conceived the first concept of a decentralized computer system known as [[Mix network|Mix Network]]. It enabled for an anonymous email communications network which decentralized the authentication of the messages in a protocol which would become the precursor to [[Onion routing|Onion Routing]], the protocol of the infamous [[Tor (anonymity network)|TOR browser]]. Through this initial development of an anonymous communications network, David Chaum applied his Mix Network philosophy to design the world's first decentralized payment system and patented it in 1980 ([https://patents.google.com/patent/US4529870 Patent US4529870]). Later in 1982, for his PhD dissertation, he wrote about the need for decentralized computing services in the paper [https://chaum.com/publications/research_chaum_2.pdf Computer Systems Established, Maintained and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups]. He would go on to launch the world's first decentralized payment system in 1990 called [[Ecash|eCash]]. ([[DigiCash|Digicash]])

== Peer-to-peer ==

Based on a "grid model" a [[peer-to-peer]] system, or P2P system, is a collection of applications run on several local computers, which connect remotely to each other to complete a function or a task. There is no main [[operating system]] to which satellite systems are subordinate. This approach to [[software development]] (and distribution) affords developers great savings, as they don't have to create a central control point. An example application is [[LAN messenger|LAN messaging]] which allows users to communicate without a central server.

== File sharing applications ==

One of the most interesting debates over decentralized computing involved [[Napster#Origin|Napster]], a music [[file sharing]] application, which granted users access to an enormous database of files. [[Record industry|Record companies]] brought legal action against Napster, blaming the system for lost record sales. Napster was found in violation of [[copyright]] laws by distributing [[Copyright infringement of software|unlicensed software]], and was shut down.

After the fall of Napster, there was a demand for a file sharing system that would be less vulnerable to [[Lawsuit|litigation]]. [[Gnutella]], a decentralized system, was developed. This system allowed files to be queried and shared between users, without a central [[Directory (file systems)|directory]], and therefore shielded the network from legal issues of individual users.
