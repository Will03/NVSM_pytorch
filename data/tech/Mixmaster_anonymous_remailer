'''Mixmaster''' is a Type II [[anonymous remailer]] which sends messages in fixed-size packets and reorders them, preventing anyone watching the messages go in and out of remailers from tracing them.  It is an implementation of a Chaumian [[Mix network]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mixmaster.sourceforge.net/manpage.html |title=Mixmaster man page |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=January 14, 2008  |publisher=[[SourceForge]] |accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
Mixmaster was originally written by [[Lance Cottrell]], and was maintained by [[Len Sassaman]]. [[Peter Palfrader]] is the current maintainer. Current Mixmaster software can be compiled to handle [[Cypherpunk anonymous remailer|Cypherpunk]] messages as well; they are needed as reply blocks for [[nym server]]s.
