'''Tor-ramdisk''' is an [[i686]] [[uClibc]]-based micro [[Linux distribution]] whose only purpose is to host a [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] server in an environment that maximizes security and privacy. Security is enhanced in Tor-ramdisk by employing a monolithically compiled [[Grsecurity|GRSEC]]/[[PaX]] patched kernel and hardened system tools. Privacy is enhanced by turning off logging at all levels so that even the Tor operator only has access to minimal information. Finally, since everything runs in ephemeral memory, no information survives a reboot, except for the Tor configuration file and the private [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] key, which may be exported and imported by [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or [[Secure copy|SCP]].
