'''Context-aware computing''' refers to a general class of mobile systems that can sense their physical environment, and adapt their behavior accordingly.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJSH/vol4_no1_2010/1.pdf|last= Rosslin John |first= Robles|date=January 2010|title= Review: Context Aware Tools for Smart Home Development|journal= International Journal of Smart Home|volume=4|pages=2–3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Thyagaraju |last= GS |author2=Umakant P Kulkarni |title=Design and Implementation of User Context aware Recommendation Engine for Mobile using Bayesian Network, Fuzzy Logic and Rule Base|journal=International Journal of Computer Applications|volume=40 |issue=3|pages=47–63 |year= 2012|doi= 10.5120/5028-7176}}</ref>

Context-aware systems are a component of a [[ubiquitous computing]] or [[pervasive computing]] environment.<ref name="Design and Implementation of User Context aware Recommendation Engine for Mobile using Bayesian Network, Fuzzy Logic and Rule Base ">Review:{{cite journal |first=Thyagaraju |last= GS |author2=Umakant P Kulkarni |title=Design and Implementation of User Context aware Recommendation Engine for Mobile using Bayesian Network, Fuzzy Logic and Rule Base|journal=International Journal of Computer Applications|volume=40 |issue=3|pages=47–63 |year= 2012|doi= 10.5120/5028-7176}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Three important aspects of context are: where you are; who you are with; and what resources are nearby. Although location is a primary capability, location-aware does not necessarily capture things of interest that are mobile or changing. Context-aware in contrast is used more generally to include nearby people, devices, lighting, noise level, network availability, and even the social situation, e.g., whether you are with your family or a friend from school.<ref name=" Review: Context Aware Tools for Smart Home Development ">Review: {{cite web|url= http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJSH/vol4_no1_2010/1.pdf|last= Rosslin John |first= Robles|date=January 2010|title= Review: Context Aware Tools for Smart Home Development|journal= International Journal of Smart Home|volume=4|pages=2–3}}</ref>

== History ==
The concept emerged from [[ubiquitous computing]] research at [[Xerox PARC]] and elsewhere in the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The term 'context-aware' was first used by Schilit and Theimer in their 1994 paper ''Disseminating Active Map Information to Mobile Hosts'' where they describe a model of computing ''in which users interact with many different mobile and stationary computers'' and classify a context-aware systems as one that can ''adapt according to its location of use, the collection of nearby people and objects, as well as the changes to those objects over time over the course of the day.''<ref name="schilit94b">{{cite journal
