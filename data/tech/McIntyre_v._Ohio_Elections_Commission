'''''McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission''''', 514 U.S. 334 (1995),<ref name=findlaw>{{ussc|name=McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission|volume=514|page=334|pin=|year=1995}}. {{usgovpd}}</ref> is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that an Ohio statute that prohibits anonymous political or campaign literature is unconstitutional.  Writing for the Court, Justice Stevens asserted that such action is protected by the First Amendment, and therefore violated the constitutional principle of [[freedom of speech]]. Justice Scalia dissented, in an opinion which Chief Justice Rehnquist joined.  Justice Ginsburg wrote a concurrence, while Justice Thomas wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment.

== Background ==
Margaret McIntyre, a [[taxpayer]], passed out pamphlets that opposed a proposed school tax.  The Ohio Elections Commission found her guilty of violating Ohio Code ยง 3599.09(A), which forbade "the distribution of campaign literature that does not contain the name and address of the person or campaign official issuing the literature."<ref name=findlaw/> The Board fined her.<ref name=findlaw />

McIntyre appealed to the Court of Common Pleas, which reversed the decision. The [[Ohio Court of Appeals]] reversed that court, putting back the fine.  The [[Ohio Supreme Court]] affirmed the [[Appellate jurisdiction|appellate]] court.  She petitioned to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted ''[[writ of certiorari]]''.  Extensive ''[[amici curiae|amici]]'' briefs were filed in the case.  In the meanwhile, the plaintiff had died, but her [[executor]] continued the [[litigation]].<ref name=findlaw />

==Subsequent law==
Fifteen years later, the Supreme Court distinguished the ''McIntyre'' rule in ''[[Doe v. Reed]]'', 561 U.S. 186 (2010).  In ''Doe'', they held that the disclosure of [[signature]]s on a [[referendum]] does '''not''' violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.<ref>{{ussc|name=Doe v. Reed|volume=561|page=186|pin=|year=2010}}.</ref>  This holding came out of the [[Washington Referendum 71 (2009)]], in which the people of Washington state confirmed Senate Bill 5688, a law extending the rights and obligations of [[domestic partnership]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

A defendant in a [[defamation]] lawsuit attempted to use this case as a [[precedent]] that "sources have the right of anonymous speech under the First Amendment", but in 2011, the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] rejected the argument, distinguishing that case from ''McIntyre''.<ref>''[http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/opinions/supreme/A710TooMuchMediavHale.pdf Too Much Media, LLC v. Hale]'' (N.J. 2011), slip. op. at 37, fn. 5, citing ''McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission'', 514 U.S. 334, 341-43, 115 S. Ct. 1511, 1516-17, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426, 436-37 (1995).  Accessed June 7, 2011.</ref>  In that case, the defendant was held not to be a [[journalist]] for the purposes of [[Privilege (evidence)|privilege]], but was she also not anonymous, as she had posted her identity.<ref>''Too Much Media, LLC v. Hale,'', ''supra'', slip. op. at 38, fn. 5.</ref>

During the [[Albany, New York]] 2011 school budget campaign, anonymous flyers were mailed and telephones called that (unsuccessfully) aimed to defeat the [[Albany City School District]] budget.<ref name=Albany>{{cite news|publisher=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]|title=Proposed law: Blast a school budget, attach your name; Legislators want more disclosure on efforts to sway school votes|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Proposed-law-Blast-a-school-budget-attach-your-1402289.php|author=Scott Waldman|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>  It was later revealed that it was funded by "a charter-affiliated group ... connected to Tom Carroll," who was "founder of the Brighter Choice Foundation, which supports all of the city's 11 [[charter school]]s."<ref name=Albany />  The opponents of the [[state school|public school]]s spent $6,766 on [[postage]] for the mailings, while "the total cost of the {{Sic|hide=y|professionally|-}}produced postcards, as well as a telephone [[push poll]], likely far exceeded $10,000."<ref name=Albany />  This led to a bill being introduced into the [[New York State Legislature]] to require disclosure for political mailings that cost over $1,000.<ref name=Albany />  The bill was written by majority legislators Member of the Assembly [[Sam Hoyt]] and Senator [[Kenneth LaValle]].<ref name=Albany />  That bill is pending as of June 2011.

==The importance of anonymous speech==
In striking down the law, the court considered some important reasons to allow anonymous speech that weighed in their decision.
# Enhance authority - "Anonymity thereby provides a way for a writer who may be personally unpopular to ensure that readers will not prejudge her message simply because they do not like its proponent."<ref>''McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission'', 514 U.S. 334, 342.</ref>
# Encourage open discourse - "The interest in having anonymous works enter the marketplace of ideas unquestionably outweighs any public interest in requiring disclosure as a condition of entry."<ref>''McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission'', 514 U.S. 334, 374.</ref>
# Safety from retaliation - "The decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a desire to preserve as much of one's privacy as possible."<ref>''McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission'', 514 U.S. 334, 341.</ref>
