A '''smart city''' is an [[urban area]] that uses different types of electronic [[data collection]] sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently. This includes data collected from citizens, devices, and assets that is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste management, law enforcement, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLaren|first1=Duncan|last2=Agyeman|first2=Julian|title=Sharing Cities: A Case for Truly Smart and Sustainable Cities|date=2015|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262029728|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KhvLCgAAQBAJ&dq=smart+cities+and+sustainability|language=en}}</ref><ref name="academia.edu">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/21181336|title=Smart City Roadmap|author=Sam Musa|publisher=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2017}} The smart city concept integrates [[information and communication technology ]] (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the network (the [[Internet of things]] or IoT) to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3047795/the-3-generations-of-smart-cities|title=The 3 Generations Of Smart Cities|date=10 August 2015|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Peris-Ortiz|first1=Marta|last2=Bennett|first2=Dag R.|last3=Yábar|first3=Diana Pérez-Bustamante|title=Sustainable Smart Cities: Creating Spaces for Technological, Social and Business Development|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319408958|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AtQ0DQAAQBAJ&dq=smart+cities+and+sustainability|language=en}}</ref> Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving.

==Terminology==
Due to the breadth of technologies that have been implemented under the smart city label, it is difficult to distill a precise definition of a smart city. Deakin and Al Wear<ref name=DeakinAl_jrnl>{{cite journal |title=From Intelligent to Smart Cities |journal=Journal of Intelligent Buildings International: From Intelligent Cities to Smart Cities |last=Deakin |first=Mark |last2=Al Waer |first2=Husam |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=140–152 |doi=10.1080/17508975.2011.586671 |year=2011 }}</ref> list four factors that contribute to the definition of a smart city:

# The application of a wide range of electronic and digital technologies to communities and cities
# The use of ICT to transform life and working environments within the region
# The embedding of such Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) in government systems
# The territorialisation of practices that brings ICTs and people together to enhance the innovation and knowledge that they offer.

Deakin defines the smart city as one that utilises ICT to meet the demands of the market (the citizens of the city), and that community involvement in the process is necessary for a smart city.<ref name=DeakinIntro>{{cite book |last=Deakin |first1=Mark |title=Smart Cities: Governing, Modelling and Analysing the Transition |chapter=From intelligent to smart cities |editor-last=Deakin | editor-first=Mark |publisher=Taylor and Francis |date=2013-08-22 |page=15 |isbn=978-1135124144 }}</ref> A smart city would thus be a city that not only possesses ICT technology in particular areas, but has also implemented this technology in a manner that positively impacts the local community.

==Characteristics==
It has been suggested that a smart city (also community, [[business cluster]], [[urban agglomeration]] or region) uses [[information and communication technologies|information technologies]] to:

These forms of intelligence in smart cities have been demonstrated in three ways:
[[File:Bletchley Park - Draco2008.jpg|thumbnail|right|Bletchley Park often considered to be the first smart community.]]
# '''Orchestration intelligence''':<ref name=Komninos_ch /> Where cities establish institutions and community-based problem solving and collaborations, such as in [[Bletchley Park]], where the Nazi Enigma cypher was decoded by a team led by [[Alan Turing]]. This has been referred to as the first example of a smart city or an intelligent community.<ref>{{cite book |last=Komninos |first1=Nicos |title=From Intelligent to Smart Cities |journal=Journal of Intelligent Buildings International: From Intelligent Cities to Smart Cities |chapter=Intelligent cities: Variable geometries of spatial intelligence. |editor-last=Deakin |editor-first=Mark |editor-last2=Al Waer |editor-first2=Husam |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=140–152 |doi=10.1080/17508975.2011.586671 |year=2011 }}</ref>
# '''Empowerment intelligence''': Cities provide [[open platform]]s, experimental facilities and smart city infrastructure in order to cluster innovation in certain districts. These are seen in the Kista Science City in Stockholm and the Cyberport Zone in Hong Kong. Similar facilities have also been established in Melbourne.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nre.vic.gov.au/melbourne2030online/content/implementation_plans/03b_actions.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530120605/http://www.nre.vic.gov.au/melbourne2030online/content/implementation_plans/03b_actions.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-05-30 |title=Melbourne 2030 |author=Department of Sustainability and Environment |publisher=State Government of Victoria |date=2005 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}</ref>[[File:C1&C2look.jpg|thumbnail|right|Hong Kong Cyberport 1 and Cyberport 2 Buildings]]
# '''Instrumentation intelligence''': Where city infrastructure is made smart through [[real-time data]] collection, with analysis and [[predictive modelling]] across city districts. There is much controversy surrounding this, particularly with regards to [[surveillance issues in smart cities]]. Examples of Instrumentation intelligence have been implemented in Amsterdam.<ref name=Amsterdam /> This is implemented through:<ref name=Komninos_ch />
## A common [[internet protocol|IP]] infrastructure that is open to researchers to develop applications.
## Wireless meters and devices transmit information at the point in time.
## A number of homes being provided with [[smart energy meter]]s to become aware of energy consumption and reduce energy usage
## [[Solar power]] [[garbage compactor]]s, [[Charging station|car recharging stations]] and [[energy saving lamp]]s.

According to David K. Owens, the former executive vice president of the [[Edison Electric Institute]], two key elements that a smart city must have are an integrated communications platform and a "dynamic resilient grid." Both are large investments.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/9120-america-needs-smart-grid-investments-pronto-stakeholders-say-naruc-event/|title=America needs smart grid investments pronto, stakeholders say at NARUC event|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2017-11-16|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Frameworks ==
In order to achieve an accurate description and explanation of the concept of Smart City it is needed to first analyse the topic through a specific framework. The framework is divided into 4 main dimensions:

=== Technology framework ===
Several concepts of the Smart city rely heavily on the use of technology; a technological Smart City is not just one concept but there are different combinations of technological infrastructure that build a concept of smart city.
* '''Digital city''': it combines service oriented infrastructure, innovation services and communication infrastructure; Yovanof, G. S. & Hazapis, G. N.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yovanof|first=Gregory S.|last2=Hazapis|first2=George N.|date=2009-03-19|title=An Architectural Framework and Enabling Wireless Technologies for Digital Cities &amp; Intelligent Urban Environments|journal=Wireless Personal Communications|language=en|volume=49|issue=3|pages=445–463|doi=10.1007/s11277-009-9693-4|issn=0929-6212}}</ref> define a digital city “a connected community that combines broadband communications infrastructure; a flexible, service-oriented computing infrastructure based on open industry standards; and, innovative services to meet the needs of governments and their employees, citizens and businesses”.
: The main purpose is to create an environment in which citizens are interconnected and easily share information anywhere in the city.
* '''Virtual city''': In these kinds of cities functions are implemented in a cyberspace; it includes the notion of hybrid city, which consists of a reality with real citizens and entities and a parallel virtual city of real entities and people. Having a smart city that is virtual means that in some cities it is possible the coexistence between these two reality, however the issue of physical distance and location is still not easy to manage. The vision of the world without distance still remains unmet in many ways. In practice this idea is hold up through physical [[IT infrastructure]] of cables, data centers, and exchanges.
* '''Information city:''' It collects local information and delivered them to the public portal; In that city, many inhabitants are able to live and even work on the Internet because they could obtain every information through IT infrastructures, thanks to the sharing information method among citizens themselves. Using this approach, an information city could be an urban centre both economically and socially speaking; the most important thing is the linkage among civic services, people interactions and government institutions.
* '''Intelligent city:''' it involves function as research or technological innovation to support learning and innovation procedure. The notion emerges in a social context in which knowledge, learning process and creativity have great importance and the human capital is considered the most precious resource within this type of technological city. In particular one of the most significant feature of an intelligent city is that every infrastructure is up to date, that means have the latest technology in telecommunications, electronic and mechanical technology. According to Komninos and Sefertzi,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urenio.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/Intelligent-Cities-Shenzhen-2009-Komninos-Sefertzi.pdf|title=Intelligent Cities: R&D offshoring, web 2.0 product development and globalization of innovation systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> the attempt to build an “intelligent” Smart City is more a radical innovation rather than an incremental innovation owing to a big quantity of efforts to use IT trying to transform the daily life.
* '''Ubiquitous city''' (U-city): It creates an environment that connect citizens to any services through any device. According to Anthopoulos, L., & Fitsilis, P.,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Next Generation Society. Technological and Legal Issues|last=Anthopoulos|first=Leonidas|last2=Fitsilis|first2=Panos|date=2009-09-23|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642116292|editor-last=Sideridis|editor-first=Alexander B.|series=Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering|pages=360–372|language=en|editor-last2=Patrikakis|editor-first2=Charalampos Z.|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-11631-5_33}}</ref> U-city is a further extension of digital city concept because of the facility in terms of accessibility to every infrastructure. This makes easier to the citizen the use of any available devices to interconnect them. Its goal is to create a city where any citizen can get any services anywhere and anytime through any kind of devices. It is important to highlights that the ubiquitous city is different from the above virtual city: while the virtual city creates another space by visualizing the real urban elements within the virtual space, U-city is given by the computer chips inserted to those urban elements.
* '''Cognitive Smart City:''' [[Cognitive smart city]] expands the concept of the smart city by referring to the convergence of the emerging [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) and smart city technologies, their generated [[big data]], and artificial intelligence techniques. Continuous learning through human interactions and consequently performing a dynamic and flexible behavior and actions based on the dynamic environment of the city are the core components of such framework.

=== Human framework ===
Human infrastructure (i.e., creative occupations and workforce, knowledge networks, voluntary organisations) is a crucial axis for city development.
* '''Creative city''': creativity is recognized as a key driver to smart city and it represents also a version of it. Social infrastructures, like for instance intellectual and social capital are indispensable factors to build a city that is smart according to the human framework. These infrastructures concern people and their relationship. Smart City benefits from social capital and it could be possible and easier to create a Smart city concept if there are mix of education and training, culture and arts, business and commerce as Bartlett, L.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.engagingcommunities2005.org/abstracts/Bartlet-%20Leo-final.pdf|title=engagingcommunities2005.org|website=www.engagingcommunities2005.org|access-date=2016-12-20}}</ref> said.
* '''Learning city''': according to Moser, M. A.,<ref name="Brent">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/ejournal/archive/v10-11/v10-11n1Moser-browse.html|title=What is Smart about the Smart Communities Movement?|last=Moser|first=Mary Anne|website=www.ucalgary.ca|publisher=University of Calgary EJournal 10-11(1)|access-date=2016-12-20}}</ref> learning city is involved in building skilled workforce. This type of city in the human context improves the competitiveness in the global knowledge economy and Campbell [16] established a typology of cities that are learning to be smart: individually proactive city, city cluster, one-to-one link between cities, and city network. That lead a city to learn how it should be possible and realistic to be smart through learning process followed by city workforce.
* '''Humane city:''' It exploits human potential, in particular the knowledge workforce. Following this approach, it is possible focus on education and builds a center of higher education, which is the city, obtaining better-educated individuals. According to Glaeser, E. L., & Berry, C.

As a consequence of the above movement, the difference between Smart City and not are getting wider; Smart places are getting smarter while other places getting less smart because such places act as a magnet for creative people and workers (Malanga, S. 2004 <ref>{{cite web |last1=Malanga |first1=Steven |title=The Curse of the Creative Class |url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/curse-creative-class-12491.html |website=City Journal |language=en |date=23 December 2015}}</ref>).
* '''Knowledge city:''' It is related to knowledge economy and innovation process; this type of Smart City is very similar to a learning city, the only difference refers to “a knowledge city is heavily related to knowledge economy, and its distinction is stress on innovation” (Dirks, S., Gurdgiev, C., & Keeling, M.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zurich.ibm.com/pdf/isl/infoportal/IBV_SC3_report_GBE03348USEN.pdf|title=Smarter cities for smarter growth: How cities can optimize their systems for the talent-based economy|last=|first=|date=|website=www.zurich.ibm.com|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>).
:The concept of knowledge city is linked with similar evolving concepts of Smart City such as intelligent city and educating city. The most important feature of this city is the fundamental concept of knowledge-based urban development, which has become an important and widespread mechanism for the development of knowledge cities.

=== Institutional framework ===
According to Moser, M. A.,<ref name="Brent"/> since 1990s the Smart Communities movement took shape as a strategy to broaden the base of users involved in IT. Members of these Communities are people that share their interest and work in a partnership with government and other institutional organizations to push the use of IT to improve the quality of daily life as a consequence of different worsening in daily actions. Eger, J. M.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eger |first1=John M. |title=Smart Growth, Smart Cities, and the Crisis at the Pump A Worldwide Phenomenon |issue=1 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1552016 |journal=Iways |volume=32 |pages=47–53 |date=1 January 2009}}</ref> said that a smart community makes a conscious and agreed-upon decision to deploy technology as a catalyst to solving its social and business needs. It is very important to understand that this use of IT and the consequent improvement could be more demanding without the institutional help; indeed institutional involvement is essential to the success of smart community initiatives. Again Moser, M. A.<ref name="Brent"/> explained that “building and planning a smart community seeks for smart growth”; a smart growth is essential what the partnership between citizen and institutional organizations try to do that is a reaction to worsening trends in daily things, like for instance traffic congestion, school overcrowding and air pollution. However it is important noticed that technological propagation is not an end in itself, but only a means to reinventing cities for a new economy and society. To sum up, it could possible to assert that any Smart City initiatives necessitate the governance support for their success.

The importance of these three different dimensions consist that only a link, correlation among them make possible a development of a real concept of Smart City. According to the definition of Smart City given by Caragliu, A., Del Bo, C., & Nijkamp, P.,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Caragliu |first1=A. |last2=Del Bo |first2=C. |last3=Nijkamp |first3=P. |title=Smart cities in Europe |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/vua/wpaper/2009-48.html |publisher=VU University Amsterdam, Faculty of Economics, Business Administration and Econometrics |language=en |date=2009}}</ref> a city is smart when investments in human/social capital and IT infrastructure fuel sustainable growth and enhance quality of life, through participatory governance.

=== Energy framework ===
Smart cities use data and technology to create efficiencies, improve sustainability, create economic development, and enhance quality of life factors for people living and working in the city. It also means that the city has a smarter energy infrastructure. A more formal definition is this: “… An urban area that has securely integrated technology across the information . . . and Internet of Things (IoT) sectors to better manage a city’s assets.”<ref name=":5" />

A smart city is powered by “smart connections” for various items such as street lighting, [[Building automation|smart buildings]], [[Distributed generation|distributed energy resources]] (DER), [[Data analysis|data analytics]], and smart transportation. Amongst these things, energy is paramount; this is why utility companies play a key role in smart cities. Electric companies, working partnership with city officials, technology companies and a number of other institutions, are among the major players that helped accelerate the growth of America’s smart cities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/5836-pittsburgh-san-diego-city-officials-put-utilities-major-players-smart-city-partnerships/|title=Pittsburgh, San Diego city officials put utilities as major players in smart-city partnerships|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2017-06-15|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Data Management framework===
Smart city employs a combination of data collection, processing, and disseminating technologies in conjunction with networking and computing technologies and data security and privacy measures encouraging application innovation to promote the overall quality of life for its citizens and covering dimensions that include: utilities, health, transportation, entertainment and government services.<ref>Gharaibeh, A., Salahuddin, M.

In London, a traffic management system known as SCOOT optimises green light time at traffic intersections by feeding back magnetometer and inductive loop data to a supercomputer, which can co-ordinate traffic lights across the city to improve traffic throughout.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9AiDAAAQBAJ|title=Science and the City: The Mechanics Behind the Metropolis|last=Winkless|first=Laurie|date=2016-08-11|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781472913227|language=en}}</ref>

The city of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] in [[Cantabria]], northern [[Spain]], has 20,000 sensors connecting buildings, infrastructure, transport, networks and utilities, offers a physical space for experimentation and validation of the IoT functions, such as interaction and management protocols, device technologies, and support services such as discovery, [[identity management]] and security<ref name= Schaffers>{{cite book|isbn=9783642208973|authors=Schaffers, H., Komninos, N., Pallot, M., Trousse, B., and Nilsson M. |year=2011 |title= Smart Cities and the Future Internet: Towards Cooperation Frameworks for Open Innovation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=Vol. 6656 |series= ''The Future Internet'' |pages= 431–446}}</ref>  In Santander, the sensors monitor the levels of [[pollution]], [[noise]], [[traffic]] and parking.

Electronic cards (known as [[smart card]]s) are another common platform in smart city contexts. These cards possess a unique encrypted identifier that allows the owner to log into a range of government provided services (or [[e-service]]s) without setting up multiple accounts. The single identifier allows governments to aggregate [[big data|data]] [[Mass surveillance|about citizens]] and their preferences to improve the provision of services and to determine common interests of groups. This technology has been implemented in Southampton.<ref name=DeakinAl_jrnl />

==Roadmap==
{{One source|section|date=October 2017}}
A smart city roadmap consists of four/three (the first is a preliminary check) major components:<ref name="academia.edu" />
# Define exactly what is the community: maybe that definition can condition what you are doing in the subsequent steps; it relates to geography, links between cities and countryside and flows of people between them; maybe – even – that in some Countries the definition of City/community that is stated does not correspond effectively to what – in fact – happens in the real life
# Study the Community: Before deciding to build a smart city, first we need to know why.  This can be done by determining the benefits of such an initiative.  Study the community to know the citizens, the business's needs –  know the citizens and the community's unique attributes, such as the age of the citizens, their education, hobbies, and attractions of the city.
# Develop a Smart City Policy: Develop a [[policy]] to drive the initiatives, where roles, responsibilities, objective, and goals, can be defined.  Create plans and strategies on how the goals will be achieved.
# Engage The Citizens: This can be done by engaging the citizens through the use of [[e-government]] initiatives, [[open data]], sport events, etc.
In short, People, Processes, and Technology (PPT) are the three principles of the success of a smart city initiative.  Cities must study their citizens and communities, know the processes, business drivers, create policies, and objectives to meet the citizens' needs.  Then, technology can be implemented to meet the citizens' need, in order to improve the quality of life and create real economic opportunities.This requires a holistic customized approach that accounts for city cultures, long-term city planning, and local regulations.<blockquote>“Whether to improve security, resiliency, sustainability, traffic congestion, public safety, or city services, each community may have different reasons for wanting to be smart. But all smart communities share common attributes—and they all are powered by smart connections and by our industry’s smarter energy infrastructure. A [[smart grid]] is the foundational piece in building a smart community.” — Pat Vincent-Collawn, chairman of the [[Edison Electric Institute]] and president and CEO of [[PNM Resources]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/8322-eei-chairman-pledges-collaborate-communities-powering-technology-support-smart-cities/|title=EEI chairman pledges to collaborate with communities on powering technology to support smart cities|last=Carey|first=Liz|date=2017-10-06|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}</ref></blockquote>

==Commercialisation==
Large IT, telecommunication and energy management companies such as [[Cisco]], [[Schneider Electric]], [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]] market initiatives for intelligent cities. Cisco, launched the ''Global Intelligent Urbanization'' initiative<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2009/prod_021209c.html|title=Network as the Next Utility for "Intelligent Urbanisation"|publisher=CISCO|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215022011/http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2009/prod_021209c.html|archivedate=2014-12-15|df=}}</ref> to help cities using the network as the fourth utility for integrated city management, better [[quality of life]] for citizens, and economic development.

There are a number of cities actively pursuing a smart city strategy:

=== Amsterdam ===
[[File:KeizersgrachtReguliersgrachtAmsterdam.jpg|thumbnail|right|Street lamps in [[Amsterdam]] have been upgraded to allow municipal councils to dim the lights based on pedestrian usage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/projects/detail/id/9/slug/climate-street |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ Climate Street |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}</ref>]]The [[Amsterdam]] Smart City initiative<ref name=Amsterdam /> which began in 2009 currently includes 170+ projects collaboratively developed by local residents, government and businesses.<ref name=DeakinIntro /> These projects run on an interconnected platform through [[wireless device]]s to enhance the city's real time decision making abilities.

=== Barcelona ===
[[File:Bus Articulat Barcelona.JPG|thumbnail|left|A new bus network was implemented in Barcelona due to smart city data analytics.]]
[[Barcelona]] has established a number of projects that can be considered 'smart city' applications within its "CityOS" strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibarcelona.bcn.cat/en/o-government/city-os|title=iBarcelona|publisher=}}</ref> For example, sensor technology has been implemented in the irrigation system in Parc del Centre de Poblenou, where real time data is transmitted to gardening crews about the level of water required for the plants.<ref name=Barcelona /><ref>{{cite news |last=Laursen |first=Lucas |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/532511/barcelonas-smart-city-ecosystem/ |title=Barcelona's Smart City Ecosystem |work=MIT Technology Review |date=2014-11-18 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}</ref> Barcelona has also designed a new bus network based on data analysis of the most common traffic flows in Barcelona, utilising primarily vertical, horizontal and diagonal routes with a number of interchanges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smartcity.bcn.cat/en/new-bus-network.html |title=New bus network |author=BCN Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}</ref> Integration of multiple smart city technologies can be seen through the implementation of smart traffic lights<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smartcity.bcn.cat/en/smart-traffic-lights.html |title=Smart traffic lights |author=BCN Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}</ref> as buses run on routes designed to optimise the number of green lights. In addition, where an emergency is reported in Barcelona, the approximate route of the emergency vehicle is entered into the traffic light system, setting all the lights to green as the vehicle approaches through a mix of GPS and traffic management software, allowing emergency services to reach the incident without delay. Much of this data is managed by the [[Sentilo Platform]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.22barcelona.com/content/blogcategory/50/281/ |title=Urban Innovation |author=Ajuntament de Barcelona |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://connecta.bcn.cat |title=Sentilo BCN:Platform Sensors and Actuators Barcelona |date=|website=|publisher=|access-date= 26 March 2017 }}</ref>

=== Columbus, Ohio ===
{{Commons category|Smart Columbus Experience Center}}

In the summer of 2017, the [[Columbus, Ohio|City of Columbus]], Ohio began its pursuit of a smart city initiative. It partnered with [[American Electric Power|American Electric Power Ohio]] to create a group of new [[Charging station|electric vehicle charging stations]]. Many smart cities such as Columbus are using agreements such as this one to prepare for climate change, expand electric infrastructure, convert existing public vehicle fleets to electric cars, and create incentives for people to [[Carpool|share rides when commuting]]. For doing this, the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] gave the City of Columbus a $40 million grant. The city also received $10 million from [[Vulcan Inc.]]<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/7711-aep-ohio-build-car-charging-stations-part-columbus-smart-city-initiative/|title=AEP Ohio to build car charging stations as part of Columbus Smart City initiative|last=Galford|first=Chris|date=2017-09-08|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}</ref>

One key reason why the utility was involved in the picking of locations for new electric vehicle charging stations was to gather data. According to ''Daily Energy Insider'', the group Infrastructure and Business Continuity for AEP said, "You don’t want to put infrastructure where it won’t be used or maintained. The data we collect will help us build a much bigger market in the future."<ref name=":4" />

Because autonomous vehicles are currently seeing "an increased industrial research and legislative push globally", building routes and connections for them is another important part of the Columbus Smart City initiative.<ref name=":4" />

===Dubai===

A document written in 2011 refers to 18th century [[Żejtun]] as the earliest "smart city" in Malta,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of History Week|last=Vassallo|first=Carmel|date=2011|title=Żejtun: An Eighteenth-Century 'Smart City'|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Proceedings%20of%20History%20Week/PHW2011/07s.pdf|volume=|issue=7|pages=105–118}}</ref> but not in the modern context of a smart city.  By the 21st century, [[SmartCity Malta]], a planned technology park, is partially operational while the rest is on construction, as a [[Foreign Direct Investment]].

=== Manchester ===
In December 2015, [[Manchester]]'s CityVerve project was chosen as the winner of a government-led technology competition and awarded £10m to develop an [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) smart cities demonstrator.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/manchester-wins-10m-prize-to-become-world-leader-in-smart-city-technology], Manchester wins £10m prize to become world leader in 'smart city' technology.</ref>

Established in July 2016, the project is being carried out by a consortium of 22 public and private organisations, including [[Manchester City Council]], and is aligned with the city's on-going devolution commitment.<ref>[http://www.manchester.gov.uk/news/article/7343/manchester_announced_as_uk_s_internet_of_things_iot_city_demonstrator_and_awarded_10m_investment], Manchester announced as UK's Internet of Things (IoT) City Demonstrator and awarded £10m investment.</ref>

The project has a two-year remit to demonstrate the capability of IoT applications and address barriers to deploying smart cities, such as city governance, network security, user trust and adoption, interoperability, scalability and justifying investment.

CityVerve is based on an open data principle that incorporates a 'platform of platforms'<ref>[http://www.cityverve.org.uk/platform-of-platforms/], Platform of Platforms.</ref> which ties together applications for its four key themes: transport and travel; health and social care; energy and the environment; culture and the public realm. This will also ensure that the project is scalable and able to be redeployed to other locations worldwide.

=== Milan ===
Milan, Italy was prompted to begin its Smart City strategies and initiatives by the European Union's Smart Cities and Communities initiative. However, unlike many European cities, Milan's Smart City strategies focus more on social sustainability rather than environmental sustainability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trivellato|first=Benedetta|date=January 2016|title=How can ‘smart’ also be socially sustainable? Insights from the case of Milan|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5465/ambpp.2016.10641abstract|journal=Academy of Management Proceedings|volume=2016|issue=1|pages=10641|doi=10.5465/ambpp.2016.10641abstract|issn=0065-0668}}</ref> This focus is almost exclusive to Milan and has a major influence in the way content and way its strategies are implemented as shown in the case study of the Bicocca District in Milan.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sacco|first=Pierluigi|last2=Tavano Blessi|first2=Giorgio|date=May 2009|title=The Social Viability of Culture-led Urban Transformation Processes: Evidence from the Bicocca District, Milan|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0042098009103857|journal=Urban Studies|volume=46|issue=5-6|pages=1115–1135|doi=10.1177/0042098009103857|issn=0042-0980}}</ref>

=== Milton Keynes ===
[[Milton Keynes]] has a commitment to making itself a Smart City. Currently the mechanism through which this is approached is the MK:Smart initiative,<ref name=":0" /> a collaboration of local government, businesses, academia and 3rd sector organisations. The focus of the initiative is on making energy use, water use and transport more [[sustainable]] whilst promoting [[economic growth]] in the city. Central to the project is the creation of a state-of-the-art 'MK [[Data Hub]]' which will support the acquisition and management of vast amounts of data relevant to city systems from a variety of data sources. These will include data about [[energy consumption|energy]] and [[water consumption]], transport data, data acquired through satellite technology, social and economic datasets, and [[crowdsource]]d data from [[social media]] or specialised apps.

The MK:Smart initiative has two aspects which extend our understanding of how Smart Cities should operate. The first, Our MK,<ref name=":1"/> is a scheme for promoting citizen-led sustainability issues in the city. The scheme provides funding and support to engage with citizens and help turn their ideas around sustainability into a reality.  The second aspect is in providing citizens with the skills to operate effectively in a Smart City. The Urban Data school<ref name=":2"/> is an online platform to teach school students about data skills while the project has also produced a [[MOOC]]<ref name=":3"/> to inform citizens about what a Smart City is.

=== New York City ===
New York City is developing a number of smart city initiatives. A notable example is the series of city service kiosks in the [[LinkNYC]] network. These provide services including free WiFi, phone calls, device charging stations, local wayfinding, and more, funded by advertising that plays on the kiosk’s screens{{cn|date=August 2018}}

=== San Leandro ===
The city of [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]], California is in the midst of transforming from an industrial center to a tech hub of the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]] (IoT) (technology that lets devices communicate with each other over the Internet). California's utility company [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|PG&E]] is working with the city in this endeavor and on a smart energy pilot program that would develop a distributed energy network across the city that would be monitored by IoT sensors. The goal would be to give the city an energy system that has enough capacity to receive and redistribute electricity to and from multiple energy sources.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/5732-eeis-new-board-chairman-cites-smart-city-opportunities-convention-gets-way/|title=EEI’s new board chairman cites smart-city opportunities as convention gets under way|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2017-06-12|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Santa Cruz ===
An alternative use of smart city technology can be found in [[Santa Cruz, California]], where local authorities analyse historical crime data in order to [[Predictive policing|predict police requirements]] and maximise police presence where it is required.<ref>{{cite news |last=Baxter |first=Stephen |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/general-news/20120226/modest-gains-in-first-six-months-of-santa-cruzs-predictive-police-program |title=Modest gains in first six months of Santa Cruz's predictive police program |work=Santa Cruz Sentinel |date=2012-02-26 |accessdate=2015-05-26 }}</ref> The analytical tools generate a list of 10 places each day where [[property crime]]s are more likely to occur, and then placing police efforts on these regions when officers are not responding to any emergency. This use of ICT technology is different to the manner in which European cities utilise smart city technology, possibly highlighting the breadth of the smart city concept in different parts of the world.

===Shanghai===
[[Shanghai]]'s development of the IoT and internet connection speeds have allowed for third party companies to revolutionize the productivity of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.driversofchange.com/projects/shaping-a-smart-shanghai/|title=Shaping a Smart Shanghai {{!}} Arup Foresight|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref> As mobile ride share giant, [[DiDi|DiDi Chuxing]], continuously adds more user protection features such as ride recording, and a new quick response safety center, Shanghai is furthering their smart city agenda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/features/News-News/58714/Here’s-what-you-need-to-know-about-Didi’s-new-safety-features.html|title=Here’s what you need to know about Didi’s new safety features|last=Group|first=SEEC Media|website=www.timeoutshanghai.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref> During the first [[China International Import Expo]], Shanghai focused on smart mobility and implemented sensors to accept smartphone traffic cards in all metro stations and buses to increase efficiency in the city.

===Smart cities in India===
{{Main Article|Smart Cities Mission}}
It's a retrofitting and urban renewal program being spearheaded by the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. The Government of India has the ambitious vision of developing 100 cities by modernizing existing mid-sized cities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://smartcities.gov.in/ | title=Smart Cities Mission | publisher=Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=3 August 2016}}</ref>

===Smart Nation Singapore===
{{main|Smart Nation}}
Despite its size and lack of natural resources, [[Singapore]] (a [[city-state]]) has overcome many of its challenges in 50 short years to become one of the world's most advanced and liveable countries. It has embarked on its next phase of transformation towards a Smart Nation, and endeavours to harness the power of networks, data and info-comm technologies to improve living, create economic opportunities and build closer communities.

=== Stockholm ===
[[File:Kista.jpg|thumbnail|right|The [[Kista]] Science City from above.]]
[[Stockholm]]'s smart city technology is underpinned by the [[Stokab dark fibre system]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stokab.se/In-english/ |title=This is stokab |author=Stockholm: the capital of Scandinavia |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}</ref> which was developed in 1994 to provide a universal fibre optic network across Stockholm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/toolkit/notes/PracticeNote/3244/ |title=Models for Infrastructure Sharing: Sweden's Stokab |author=ICT Regulation Toolkit |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}</ref> Private companies are able to lease fibre as service providers on equal terms. The company is owned by the City of Stockholm itself.<ref name=Stockholm /> Within this framework, Stockholm has created a Green IT strategy.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://international.stockholm.se/globalassets/ovriga-bilder-och-filer/green-it-strategy.pdf |format=PDF |title=Green IT |author=Stockholm: the Capital of Scandinavia |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}</ref> The Green IT program seeks to reduce the environmental impact of Stockholm through IT functions such as energy efficient buildings (minimising heating costs), traffic monitoring (minimising the time spent on the road) and development of e-services (minimising paper usage). The e-Stockholm platform is centred on the provision of e-services, including political announcements, parking space booking and snow clearance.<ref name=esthlm>{{cite press release |url=http://international.stockholm.se/globalassets/ovriga-bilder-och-filer/e-strategy-city-of-stockholm.pdf |format=PDF |title=e-sthlm |author=Stockholm: the Capital of Scandinavia |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}</ref> This is further being developed through GPS analytics, allowing residents to plan their route through the city.<ref name=esthlm /> An example of district-specific smart city technology can be found in the Kista Science City region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kista.com/ |title=Kista Science City |author=Kista Science City Online |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}</ref> This region is based on the triple helix concept of smart cities,<ref name=Hollands2008 /> where university, industry and government work together to develop ICT applications for implementation in a smart city strategy.

==Criticism==
{{See also|Surveillance issues in smart cities}}
The criticisms of smart cities revolve around:<ref name=Hollands2008/>
* A bias in strategic interest may lead to ignoring alternative avenues of promising urban development.<ref>{{cite book|author=Greenfield, A.|year=2013|title=Against the Smart City. |location=London|publisher=Verso|asin=B00FHQ5DBS}}</ref>
* A smart city, as a scientifically planned city, would defy the fact that real development in cities is often haphazard. In that line of criticism, the smart city is seen as unattractive for citizens as they "can deaden and stupefy the people who live in its all-efficient embrace".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/04/smart-city-rio-songdo-masdar|title=No one likes a city that's too smart|last=Sennett|first=Richard|date=4 December 2012|work=The Guardian|access-date=}}</ref> Instead, people would prefer cities they can participate to shape.
* The focus of the concept of smart city may lead to an underestimation of the possible negative effects of the development of the new technological and networked infrastructures needed for a city to be smart.<ref>{{cite book|author=Graham, S.|author2=Marvin, S. |year=1996|title=Telecommunications and the city: electronic spaces, urban place|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203430453}}</ref>
* As a [[globalization|globalized]] [[business model]] is based on [[capital mobility]], following a business-oriented model may result in a losing long term strategy: "The 'spatial fix' inevitably means that mobile capital can often 'write its own deals' to come to town, only to move on when it receives a better deal elsewhere. This is no less true for the smart city than it was for the industrial, [or] manufacturing city."<ref name=Hollands2008/>
* The high level of [[big data]] collection and analytics has raised questions regarding [[surveillance issues in smart cities|surveillance in smart cities]], particularly as it relates to [[predictive policing]].
* As of August 2018, the discussion on smart cities centres around the usage and implementation of technology rather than on the inhabitants of the cities and how they can be involved in the process.<ref>Marrone, M. & Hammerle, M.  Bus Inf Syst Eng (2018). 60: 197. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12599-018-0535-3</ref>
*Especially in low-income countries, smart cities are irrelevant to the majority of the urban population, which lives in poverty with limited access to basic services. A focus on smart cities may worsen inequality and marginalization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Vanessa|date=2013-12-06|title=African urban fantasies: dreams or nightmares?|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=215–231|doi=10.1177/0956247813513705|issn=0956-2478}}</ref>
