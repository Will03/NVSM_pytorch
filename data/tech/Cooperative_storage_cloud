A '''cooperative storage cloud''' is a decentralized model of networked [[computer data storage|online storage]] where data is stored on multiple computers ([[Node (networking)|nodes]]), hosted by the participants cooperating in the cloud. For the cooperative scheme to be viable, the total storage contributed in aggregate must be at least equal to the amount of storage needed by end users.  However, some nodes may contribute less storage and some may contribute more.  There may be reward models to compensate the nodes contributing more.

Unlike a traditional [[Cloud storage|storage cloud]], a cooperative does not directly employ dedicated servers for the actual storage of the data, thereby eliminating the need for a significant dedicated hardware investment. Each node in the cooperative runs specialized [[software]] which communicates with a centralized{{cn|date=April 2017}} control and orchestration server, thereby allowing the node to both consume and contribute storage space to the cloud. The centralized control and orchestration server requires several orders of magnitude less resources (storage, computing power, and bandwidth) to operate, relative to the overall capacity of the cooperative.

== Data security ==
Files hosted in the cloud are fragmented and [[Encryption|encrypted]] before leaving the local machine. They are then distributed randomly using a [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[geo-distribution]] [[algorithm]] to other nodes in the cooperative. Users can add an additional layer of [[Information security|security]] and reduce storage space by [[Data compression|compressing]] and encrypting files before they are copied to the cloud.

== Data redundancy ==
In order to maintain [[data integrity]] and high availability across a relatively unreliable set of computers over a [[wide area network]] like the [[Internet]], the source node will add some level of [[Data redundancy|redundancy]] to each [[Block (data storage)|data block]].<ref name=computerworld/> This allows the system to recreate the entire block even if some nodes are temporarily unavailable (due to loss of network connectivity, the machine being powered off or a hardware failure).  The most storage and [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] efficient forms of redundancy use [[Erasure code|erasure coding]] techniques like [[Reed-Solomon]].  A simple, less [[CPU]] intensive but more expensive form of redundancy is duplicate copies.

== Flexible contribution ==
Due to bandwidth or hardware constraints some nodes may not be able to contribute as much space as they consume in the cloud. On the other hand, nodes with large storage space and limited or no bandwidth constraints may contribute more than they consume, thereby the cooperative can stay in balance.

== Examples ==
The University of California's OceanStore project, MIT's [[Chord_(peer-to-peer)|Chord]], is a non-commercial example.<ref name=computerworld/>

Sia is a fully distributed system using a [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]] where a [[cryptocurrency]] is exchanged for storage, and a [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]] that can act both as a file host and as a "renter" of storage, using [[Merkle tree|Merkle trees]] to provide strong guarantees that hosts will only get paid if they successfully hold data for the duration of a "storage contract".<ref>{{Cite web

STORJ is another example: based on the [[Bitcoin]] blockchain technology and a [[peer-to-peer]] architecture, it intends to provide cloud storage to people. It is currently developing two applications to achieve this goal: ''MetaDisk'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://metadisk.org|title=Decentralized Cloud Storage — Storj|website=Decentralized Cloud Storage — Storj|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref> which lets the user upload files to the network, and ''DriveShare'', allowing users to rent out their storage space to MetaDisk users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://storj.io/|title=Decentralized Cloud Storage — Storj|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref>
