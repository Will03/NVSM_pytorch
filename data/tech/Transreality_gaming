'''Transreality gaming''', sometimes written as trans-reality gaming, also known as '''Real Life Gaming''', describes a type or a mode of [[gameplay]] that combines playing a game in a [[virtual environment]] with game-related, physical experiences in the real world and vice versa. In this approach a player evolves and moves seamlessly through various physical and virtual stages, brought together in one unified game space.<ref>Trans-Reality Gaming, Craig A. Lindley, Institution Technology, Art and New Media, University of Gotland, Visby, Sweden (2004).</ref> Alongside the rising trend of [[gamification]], the application of game mechanics to tasks that are not traditionally associated with play, a transreality approach to gaming incorporates mechanics that extend over time and space, effectively playing through a players day-to-day interactions.<ref>Bonsignore, Elizabeth M., et al. "Mixed reality games." Proceedings of the ACM 2012 conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work Companion. ACM, 2012. {{doi|10.1145/2141512.2141517}}</ref>

The essential part of transreality gaming is considered to be the fluidity between physical and virtual stages of gameplay, making it more and more difficult to see the distinction between what is allegedly 'virtual' and what is allegedly 'real' while playing.<ref>Edward Castronova, ''Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games'', The University of Chicago Press, 2005)</ref> Looking at a transreality game from that perspective it may also integrate [[big data|(big) data]] feeds into the storylines of games as a means to make the gameplay more immersive,<ref>"[http://iperg.sics.se/Publications/LindleyEladhari_DIGRA05.pdf Narrative Structure in TransReality RolePlaying Games: Integrating Story Construction from Live Action, Table Top and ComputerBased RolePlaying Games]", Craig A. Lindley, Institution Technology, Art and New Media, University of Gotland, Visby, Sweden (2005)</ref> like in the setup of Liping Xie's experimental scientific simulations in which a population of sample individuals search a real-world optimum in a virtual problem space, driven by real world forces in that space.<ref>Xie, Liping, Jianchao Zeng, and Zhihua Cui.

Different authors have used the adjective 'transreal' as a starting point for the design of [[Location-based game|location-based games]] (like [[pervasive game]]s,<ref>Kasapakis, Vlasios, Damianos Gavalas, and Nikos Bubaris.

All of these genres offer game experiences integrated with everyday routines and social networks. Its applications are to be found in [[serious game]]s (education,<ref>Dunleavy, Matt.

From a broader perspective it is argued that different [[location aware]] and [[transmedia]]l game formats may also be considered to merely provide a facilitating infrastructure for transreality gaming in a broader sense, positioned as a new way of looking at the design of game spaces, meant to be played across different realities rather than across different media.<ref>Game Space Design Foundations for Trans-Reality Games, Craig A.
