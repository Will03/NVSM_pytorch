'''OpenWrt''' is an open source project for [[embedded operating system]] based on [[Linux kernel | Linux]], primarily used on [[Embedded system|embedded devices]] to [[Router (computing)|route]] network traffic. The main components are Linux, [[util-linux]], [[musl]],<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.embedded.openwrt.devel/32651|title = OpenWrt switches to musl by default|last = Fietkau|first = Felix|date = 16 June 2015|work = |access-date = 16 June 2015|via = }}</ref> and [[BusyBox]]. All components have been optimized to be small enough to fit into the limited storage and memory available in home routers.

OpenWrt is configured using a [[command-line interface]] ([[Almquist shell|ash]] shell), or a web interface (LuCI). There are about 3500 optional [[software package (installation)|software packages]] available for installation via the [[opkg]] [[package management system]].

OpenWrt can run on various types of devices, including [[Customer-premises equipment|CPE]] routers, [[residential gateway]]s, [[smartphone]]s, [[pocket computer]]s (e.g. [[Ben NanoNote]]), and [[laptop]]s. It is also possible to run OpenWrt on [[personal computer]]s, which are most commonly based on the [[x86]] architecture.

== History ==
The OpenWrt project was started in 2004 after [[Linksys]] had built the [[firmware]] for their [[Linksys WRT54G series|WRT54G series]] of wireless routers with code licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite mailing list | url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/7/164 | title=Linksys WRT54G and the GPL | date=7 June 2003 | accessdate=5 July 2018 | mailing-list=Linux kernel mailing list | last=Miklas | first=Andrew}}</ref> Under the terms of that license, Linksys was required to make the source code of its modified version available under the same license,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3562391 | title=The Open Source WRT54G Story | last=Weiss | first=Aaron | date=8 November 2005 | website=Wi-Fi Planet | access-date=5 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/03/07/06/2121234/linksys-releases-gpled-code-for-wrt54g | title=Linksys Releases GPLed Code for WRT54G | date=6 July 2003 | website=Slashdot | access-date=5 July 2018}}</ref> which enabled independent developers to create derivative versions. Support was originally limited to the WRT54G series, but has since been expanded to include many other routers and devices from many different manufacturers.

Using this code as a base and later as a reference, developers created a [[Linux distribution]] that offers many features not previously found in consumer-level routers. Some features formerly required proprietary software. Before the introduction of OpenWrt 8.09, using Linux 2.6.25 and the <code>b43</code> kernel module, WLAN for many [[Broadcom]]-based routers was only available through the proprietary <code>wl.o</code> module that was also provided for Linux 2.4.x only. 

OpenWrt releases were historically named after cocktails, such as [[White Russian (cocktail)|White Russian]], [[Kamikaze (cocktail)|Kamikaze]], Backfire, Attitude Adjustment, Barrier Breaker and Chaos Calmer, and their recipes were included in the [[motd (Unix)|message of the day (motd)]] displayed after logging in using the [[command-line interface]].

In May 2016, OpenWrt was forked by a group of core OpenWrt contributors due to disagreements on internal process.<ref>{{Cite web

With the Attitude Adjustment (12.09) release of OpenWrt, all hardware devices with 16&nbsp;MB or less RAM are no longer supported as they can run out of memory easily.

== Features ==
OpenWrt features a writeable [[Root directory|root file system]], enabling users to modify any file and easily install additional software. This is in contrast with other firmware based on read-only file systems which don't allow modifying installed software without rebuilding and flashing a complete firmware image. This is accomplished by overlaying a read-only compressed [[SquashFS]] file system with a writeable [[JFFS2]] file system using [[overlayfs]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/flash.layout | title=The OpenWrt Flash Layout | website=OpenWrt Project | access-date=7 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://lwn.net/Articles/447650/ | title=Debating overlayfs | last=Corbet | first=Jonathan | date=15 June 2011 | website=LWN.net | access-date=7 July 2018}}</ref> Additional software can be installed with the ''opkg'' package manager and the package repository contains approximately 3500 packages.

[[Image:Openwrt-luci-firewall.png | thumb | LuCI]]
OpenWrt can be configured through either a [[command-line interface]] or a web interface called LuCI. OpenWrt provides set of scripts called UCI (unified configuration interface) to unify and simplify configuration through the command-line interface.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/uci | title=The UCI System | website=OpenWrt Project | access-date=8 July 2018}}</ref> Additional web interfaces, such as [[Gargoyle (router firmware)|Gargoyle]], are also available.

OpenWrt provides regular bug fixes and security updates even for devices that are no longer supported by their manufacturers.

Other features include:
* Extensible configuration of the entire hardware drivers, e.g. built-in [[network switch]]es and their [[VLAN]]-capabilities, [[Wireless network interface controller|WNIC]]s, [[DSL modem]]s, [[Foreign exchange service (telecommunications)|FX]], available hardware buttons, etc.
* Exhaustive possibilities to configure [[Computer network|network]]-related features, like:
** IPv4 support.
** [[IPv6]] native stack: 
*** Prefix Handling,

*** [[IPv6]] transitioning technologies (6rd, 6to4, 6in4, ds-lite, lw4o6, map-e), 
*** Downstream IPv6 configuration (Router Advertisement, [[DHCPv6]] (stateless and stateful) and DHCPv6-PD).
** [[Routing]] through [[iproute2]], [[Quagga (software)|Quagga]], [[Bird Internet routing daemon|BIRD]], [[Babel (protocol)|Babel]] etc.
** [[Mesh network]]ing through [[B.A.T.M.A.N.]], [[Optimized Link State Routing Protocol|OLSR]] and [[IEEE 802.11s]]-capabilities of the [[Comparison of open-source wireless drivers|WNIC drivers]] and other ad hoc mesh routing protocols that have been implemented within Linux.
** Wireless functionality, e.g. make the device act as a [[wireless repeater]], a [[wireless access point]], a [[wireless bridge]], a [[captive portal]], or a combination of these with e.g. [[ChilliSpot]], [[WiFiDog Captive Portal]], etc.
** Wireless security: [[Packet injection]], e.g. [http://airpwn.sourceforge.net/Airpwn.html Airpwn], [[lorcon]], e.a.
** [[Stateful firewall]], [[Network address translation|NAT]] and [[port forwarding]] through [[netfilter]]; additionally [[PeerGuardian]] is available
** Dynamically-configured port forwarding protocols [[UPnP]] and [[NAT-PMP]] through upnpd, etc.
** [[Port knocking]] via knockd and knock
** [[TR-069]] (CWMP) client<ref>{{cite web|url=https://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/Fahrplan/events/5112.en.html|title=29C3: ISP's black box|date=January 19, 2013|website=events.ccc.de}}</ref>
** [[Intrusion prevention system|IPS]] via [[Snort (software)]]
** [[Active queue management]] (AQM) through the [[network scheduler]] of the Linux kernel, with many available [[queuing discipline]]s.

== {{Anchor|BUILDROOT}}Development ==
OpenWrt's development environment and build system, known together as ''OpenWrt Buildroot'', are based on a heavily modified [[Buildroot]] system.  OpenWrt Buildroot is a set of [[Makefile]]s and [[patch (Unix)|patches]] that automates the process of building a complete Linux-based OpenWrt system for an embedded device, by building and using an appropriate [[Cross compiler|cross-compilation]] [[toolchain]].<ref name="buildroot-about">{{cite web

Embedded devices usually use a different processor than the one found in host computers used for building their OpenWrt system images, requiring a cross-compilation toolchain.  Such a compilation toolchain runs on a host system, but generates code for a targeted embedded device and its processor's [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA).  For example, if a host system uses [[x86]] and a target system uses [[MIPS32]], the regular compilation toolchain of the host runs on x86 and generates code for x86 architecture, while the cross-compilation toolchain runs on x86 and generates code for the MIPS32 architecture.  OpenWrt Buildroot automates this whole process to work on the instruction set architectures of most embedded devices and host systems.<ref name="buildroot-about" /><ref name="openwrt-dev-guide">{{cite web

OpenWrt Buildroot provides the following features:<ref name="buildroot-about" /><ref name="openwrt-dev-guide" />
* Makes it easy to port software across architectures
* Uses kconfig (Linux kernel [[menuconfig]]) for the configuration of all options
* Provides an integrated cross-compiler toolchain ([[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]], [[ld (Unix)|ld]], [[uClibc]] etc.)
* Provides an abstraction for [[autotools]] ([[automake]], [[autoconf]]), [[cmake]] and [[SCons]]
* Handles standard OpenWrt image build workflow: downloading, patching, configuration, compilation and packaging
* Provides a number of common fixes for known badly behaving packages

Besides building system images, OpenWrt development environment also provides a mechanism for simplified cross-platform building of OpenWrt software packages.  Source code for each software package is required to provide a Makefile-like set of building instructions, and an optional set of patches for bug fixes or footprint optimizations.<ref>{{cite web

== Hardware compatibility ==
OpenWrt runs many different routers, and includes a table of compatible hardware on its website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openwrt.org/toh/start|title=OpenWrt Project: Table of Hardware|website=openwrt.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> In its buyer's guide<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openwrt.org/toh/buyerguide|title=OpenWrt Project: Buyers' Guide|website=openwrt.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref>, it notes that users recommend devices equipped with wireless chips from either Qualcomm's [[Qualcomm Atheros|Atheros]] or Ralink (now [[MediaTek]]).

== Adoption ==
OpenWrt, especially its Buildroot build system, has been adopted many times:
* [[Freifunk]] and other mesh network communities
* Bufferbloat.net (Cerowrt)
* SIMET Box, developed by [[NIC.br]], is OpenWrt-based<ref>{{cite web |url=https://simet.nic.br/simetbox.html |title=Simet Box |accessdate=2017-09-14}}</ref>
