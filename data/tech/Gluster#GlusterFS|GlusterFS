'''Gluster Inc.''' was a [[software company]] that provided an open source platform for [[scale-out]] public and private [[cloud storage]]. The company was privately funded and headquartered in [[Sunnyvale, California]], with an engineering center in [[Bangalore]], India. Gluster was funded by Nexus Venture Partners and [[Index Ventures]]. Gluster was acquired by [[Red Hat]] on October 7, 2011.<ref name="buy">{{cite web |url=http://www.redhat.com/promo/storage/press-release.html |title=Red Hat to Acquire Gluster |publisher=redhat.com |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530203435/http://www.redhat.com/promo/storage/press-release.html |archivedate=May 30, 2013 |df= }}</ref>

==History==

The name ''Gluster'' combined ''[[GNU]]'' and ''cluster''. Despite the similarity in names, Gluster is not related to the [[Lustre (file system)|Lustre]] file system and does not incorporate any Lustre code.
Gluster based its product on ''GlusterFS'', an open-source software-based [[Network-attached storage|network-attached]] [[filesystem]] that deploys on commodity hardware.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.infostor.com/nas/gluster-open-source-scale-out-nas-.html |title=Gluster: Open source scale-out NAS |publisher=InfoStor.com |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>  The initial version of GlusterFS was written by Anand Babu Periasamy, Gluster's founder and CTO.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kovar |first=Joseph F. |url=http://www.crn.com/slide-shows/storage/225700107/2010-storage-superstars-25-you-need-to-know.htm?pgno=17 |title=Page 17 - 2010 Storage Superstars: 25 You Need To Know |publisher=Crn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>

[[Red Hat]] became the primary author and maintainer of the GlusterFS [[open-source software|open-source]] project after acquiring the Gluster company in October 2011.<ref name="buy" />
The product was first marketed as Red Hat Storage Server, but in early 2015 renamed to be Red Hat Gluster Storage since Red Hat has also acquired the [[Ceph (software)|Ceph]] file system technology.<ref>{{Cite web |title= New product names.

==Architecture==
The GlusterFS architecture aggregates compute, storage, and I/O resources into a global namespace. Each server plus attached commodity storage (configured as [[direct-attached storage]], [[JBOD]], or using a [[storage area network]]) is considered to be a node. Capacity is scaled by adding additional nodes or adding additional storage to each node. Performance is increased by deploying storage among more nodes. High availability is achieved by replicating data n-way between nodes.

===Public cloud deployment===
For public cloud deployments, GlusterFS offers an [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS) [[Amazon Machine Image]] (AMI), which is deployed on Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances rather than physical servers and the underlying storage is Amazon's [[Elastic Block Storage]] (EBS).<ref>{{cite web|author=Nathan Eddy |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Midmarket/Gluster-Introduces-NAS-Virtual-Appliances-for-VMware-Amazon-Web-Services-148680/ |title=Gluster Introduces NAS Virtual Appliances for VMware, Amazon Web Services |publisher=Eweek.com |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> In this environment, capacity is scaled by deploying more EBS storage units, performance is scaled by deploying more EC2 instances, and availability is scaled by n-way replication between AWS availability zones.

===Private cloud deployment===
A typical on-premises, or private cloud deployment will consist of GlusterFS installed as a virtual appliance on top of multiple commodity servers running [[hypervisor]]s such as [[Kernel-based Virtual Machine|KVM]], [[Xen]], or [[VMware]]; or on bare metal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gluster Virtual Storage Appliance|url=http://www.storage-switzerland.com/Blog/Entries/2011/2/22_Gluster_Virtual_Storage_Appliance.html|publisher=Storage Switzerland, LLC|accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref>

'''GlusterFS''' is a [[Scale out|scale-out]] [[network-attached storage]] [[file system]].  It has found applications including [[cloud computing]], streaming media services, and content delivery networks. GlusterFS was developed originally by Gluster, Inc. and then by [[Red Hat]], Inc., as a result of Red Hat acquiring Gluster in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Timothy Prickett Morgan|title=Red Hat snatches storage Gluster file system for $136m|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/04/redhat_buys_gluster/|publisher=[[The Register]]|accessdate=3 July 2016|date=4 October 2011}}</ref>

In June 2012, [[Red Hat Storage Server]] was announced as a commercially supported integration of GlusterFS with [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]].<ref>{{Cite news |title= Red Hat Storage Server NAS takes on Lustre, NetApp |author= Timothy Prickett Morgan |work= The Register |date= 27 June 2012 |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/06/27/redhat_storage_server_2_launch/ |accessdate= 30 May 2013 }}</ref>  Red Hat bought [[Inktank Storage]] in April 2014, which is the company behind the [[Ceph (software)|Ceph]] distributed file system, and re-branded GlusterFS-based Red Hat Storage Server to "Red Hat Gluster Storage".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://app.engage.redhat.com/e/es.aspx?s=1795&e=556851 |title=Red Hat Storage.

=== Design ===
GlusterFS aggregates various storage servers over [[Ethernet]] or [[Infiniband]] [[Remote direct memory access|RDMA]] interconnect into one large parallel network file system. It is free software, with some parts licensed under the GNU [[General Public License]] (GPL) v3 while others are dual licensed under either GPL v2 or the [[Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL) v3. GlusterFS is based on a stackable user space design.

GlusterFS has a client and server component. Servers are typically deployed as ''storage bricks'', with each server running a <tt>glusterfsd</tt> daemon to export a local file system as a ''volume''. The <tt>glusterfs</tt> client process, which connects to servers with a custom protocol over [[TCP/IP]], InfiniBand or [[Sockets Direct Protocol]], creates composite virtual volumes from multiple remote servers using stackable ''translators''. By default, files are stored whole, but [[data striping|striping]] of files across multiple remote volumes is also supported. The final volume may then be mounted by the client host using its own native protocol via the [[Filesystem in Userspace|FUSE]] mechanism, using [[Network File System|NFS]] v3 protocol using a built-in server translator, or accessed via <tt>gfapi</tt> client library. Native-protocol mounts may then be re-exported e.g. via the kernel NFSv4 server, [[SAMBA]], or the object-based [[OpenStack]] Storage (Swift) protocol using the "UFO" (Unified File and Object) translator.

Most of the functionality of GlusterFS is implemented as translators, including file-based [[Web mirror|mirroring]] and [[replication (computer science)|replication]], file-based [[data striping|striping]], file-based [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]], volume [[failover]], [[I/O scheduling|scheduling]] and [[disk buffer|disk caching]], [[Disk quota|storage quotas]], and volume snapshots with user serviceability (since GlusterFS version 3.6).

The GlusterFS server is intentionally kept simple: it exports an existing directory as-is, leaving it up to client-side translators to structure the store. The clients themselves are stateless, do not communicate with each other, and are expected to have translator configurations consistent with each other. GlusterFS relies on an elastic [[hash function|hashing]] algorithm, rather than using either a centralized or distributed metadata model. With version 3.1 and later of GlusterFS, volumes can be added, deleted, or migrated dynamically, helping to avoid configuration [[consistency model|coherency]] problems, and allowing GlusterFS to scale up to several [[petabyte]]s on [[commodity hardware]] by avoiding bottlenecks that normally affect more tightly coupled distributed file systems.

GlusterFS provides data reliability and availability through various options of replication: replicated volumes and [[Geo-replication]].<ref>{{Cite news |title= GlusterFS Documentation |url= https://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/Quick-Start-Guide/Architecture/ |accessdate= January 28, 2018 }}</ref> Replicated volumes ensure that exists at least one copy of each file across the bricks, thus if one fails, data can be still accessed. Geo-replication provides a master-slave model of replication, where volumes are copied across geographically distinct locations. This happens asynchronously and it is useful for backup of data in case of failure.

GlusterFS has been used as the foundation for academic research<ref>{{cite conference
