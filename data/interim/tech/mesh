A mesh is a barrier made of connected strands of metal, fiber, or other flexible or ductile materials. A mesh is similar to a spider web|web or a Net (textile)|net in that it has many attached or woven strands.

Types
* A plastic mesh may be extruded, oriented, expanded, weaving|woven<ref>[http://www.wiremeshes.eu/ Synthetic woven wire mesh] Information on polyester and polypropylene wire cloth</ref> or Cylinder (geometry)|tubular. It can be made from polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, PVC or PTFE.
* A metal mesh may be weaving|woven, knitting|knitted, welded, Expanded metal|expanded, photo-chemically etched or Electroforming|electroformed (screen filter) from steel or other metals.
* In clothing, mesh is loosely woven or knitted fabric that has a large number of closely spaced holes.  Knitted mesh is frequently used for modern sports jersey (clothing)|jerseys and other clothing.
* A mesh skin graft is a skin patch that has been cut systematically to create a mesh. Meshing of skin grafts provides coverage of a greater surface area at the recipient site, and also allows for the egress of serous or sanguinous fluid. However, it results in a rather pebbled appearance upon healing that may ultimately look less aesthetically pleasing.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1295109-overview emedicine >Skin, Grafts] Author: Benjamin C Wood.

*Fiberglass mesh<ref>Fiberglass mesh Fiberglass mesh</ref> is a neatly woven, crisscross pattern of fiberglass thread that can be used to create new products such as door screens, filtration components, and reinforced adhesive tapes. It is commonly sprayed with a Polyvinyl chloride|PVC coating to make it stronger, last longer, and to prevent Fibreglass #Health problems|skin irritation.

Uses
* Meshes are often used to screen out insects. Window screen|Wire screens on windows and mosquito netting are meshes.
* Wire screens can be used to shield against radio frequency radiation, e.g. in microwave ovens and Faraday cages.
* Metal and nylon wire mesh filters are used in Water purification|filtration.
* Wire mesh is used in guarding for secure areas and as protection in the form of Vandalism|vandal screens.
* Wire mesh can be fabricated to produce park benches, waste baskets and other baskets for material handling.
* Woven meshes are basic to screen printing.
* Surgical mesh is used to provide a reinforcing structure in surgical procedures like inguinal hernioplasty, and umbilical hernia repair.
* Meshes are used as drum heads in practice and electronic drum sets.
* Fence for livestock or poultry (chicken wire or hardware cloth)
* Humane animal trapping uses woven or welded wire mesh cages (chicken wire or hardware cloth) to trap wild animals like raccoons and skunks in populated areas.
