The Global Internet Freedom Consortium is a consortium of organizations that develop and deploy anti-censorship technologies for use by Internet users in countries whose governments restrict Web-based information access.  The organization was reportedly begun in 2001 by Chinese-born scientists living in the United States reacting against Chinese government oppression of the Falun Gong.

Products

Funding
The organization states that the majority of its funding comes from its members.  In May 2010, the group was offered a $1.5 million (USD) grant from the United States Department of State.<ref>cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/11/AR2010051105154.html?hpid%3Dtopnews&sub=AR |title=U.S. risks China's ire with decision to fund software maker tied to Falun Gong |work=Washington Post |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2010-06-06 | first=John | last=Pomfret</ref>  This move received criticism from representatives of the Chinese government.<ref>cite news|last=Smith-Spark  |first=Laura |title= US 'to give $1.5m to Falun Gong internet freedom group'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8678760.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 June 2010|date=12 May 2010</ref>
