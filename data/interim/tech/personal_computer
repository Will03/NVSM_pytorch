Early computer owners in the 1960s, invariably institutional or corporate, had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines. In the 2010s, personal computer users have access to a wide range of commercial software, free-of-charge software ("freeware") and free and open-source software, which are provided in ready-to-run form. Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or OS manufacturers.<ref>citation |author=Conlon, Tom |url=http://www.popsci.com/gadgets/article/2010-01/ipad%E2%80%99s-closed-system-sometimes-i-hate-being-right |title=The iPad's Closed System: Sometimes I Hate Being Right |publisher=Popular Science |date=January 29, 2010 |quote=The iPad is not a personal computer in the sense that we currently understand. |accessdate=2010-10-14</ref> Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer, although end-user programming is still feasible.

"PC" is an initialism for "personal computer". The IBM Personal Computer incorporated the designation in its model name, but IBM has not used this brand for many years.  It is sometimes useful, especially in a marketing context, to distinguish personal computers of the "IBM Personal Computer" family from personal computers made by other manufacturers. For example,  "PC" is used in contrast with "Mac", an Macintosh|Apple Macintosh computer.<ref>cite web|title=Mac* vs. PC Debate|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/tech-tips-and-tricks/pc-vs-mac-the-big-debate.html|website=intel.com|publisher=Intel|accessdate=5 October 2014</ref><ref>cite web|last1=Finnie|first1=Scot|title=Mac vs. PC cost analysis: How does it all add up?|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2541666/computer-hardware/mac-vs--pc-cost-analysis--how-does-it-all-add-up-.html|website=Computerworld|publisher=Computerworld, Inc|accessdate=5 October 2014|date=8 June 2007</ref><ref>cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Dan|title=Don't buy a new PC or Mac before you read this|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/dont-buy-a-new-pc-or-mac-before-you-read-this/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=5 October 2014|date=22 August 2013</ref><ref>cite web|last1=Haslam|first1=Karen|title=Mac or PC?

In the history of computing there were many examples of computers designed to be used by one person, as opposed to terminals connected to mainframe computers. It took a while for computers to be developed that meet the modern definition of a "personal computers", one that is designed for one person, is easy to use, and is cheap enough for an individual to buy.<ref name="auto">Roy A.

The Soviet MIR (computer)|MIR series of computers was developed from 1965 to 1969 in a group headed by Victor Glushkov. It was designed as a relatively small-scale computer for use in engineering and scientific applications, and contained a hardware implementation of a high-level programming language. Another innovative feature for that time was the user interface combining a keyboard with a monitor and light pen for correcting texts and drawing on screen.<ref>cite web |last=Pospelov |first=Dmitry |script-title=ru:ЭВМ серии МИР - первые персональные ЭВМ |trans-title=MIR series of computers.

The demonstration required technical support staff and a mainframe time-sharing computer that were far too costly for individual business use at the time.

By the early 1970s, people in academic or research institutions had the opportunity for single-person use of a LINC|computer system in interactive mode for extended durations, although these systems would still have been too expensive to be owned by a single person. Early personal computersmdashbgenerally called microcomputersmdashbwere often sold in a Electronic kit|kit form and in limited volumes, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians. Minimal programming was done with toggle switches to enter instructions, and output was provided by front panel lamps. Practical use required adding peripherals such as keyboards, computer displays, disk drives, and printer (computing)|printers. Micral N was the earliest commercial, non-kit microcomputer based on a microprocessor, the Intel 8008. It was built starting in 1972, and few hundred units were sold. This had been preceded by the Datapoint 2200 in 1970, for which the Intel 8008 had been commissioned, though not accepted for use. The CPU design implemented in the Datapoint 2200 became the basis for x86 instruction set architecture|architecture<ref name="Weidendorfer 2011">Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing, Intel Core Microarchitecture, x86 Processor Family|last=Weidendorfer|first=Josef|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-0-387-09765-7|location=Boston, MA|pages=</ref> used in the original IBM PC and its descendants.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9111341|title=Forgotten PC history: The true origins of the personal computer|date=22 August 2008|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822130226/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9111341|archivedate=22 August 2008|df=</ref>

In 1973, the IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center developed a portable computer prototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) based on the IBM PALM processor|IBM PALM processor with a Philips compact cassette drive, small Cathode ray tube|CRT, and full function keyboard. SCAMP emulated an IBM 1130 minicomputer in order to run APL/1130.<ref name="www03.ibm.com">cite web|url=http://www03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc/pc_1.html|title=IBM Archives|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030210111221/http://www03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc/pc_1.html|archivedate=10 February 2003|df=</ref> In 1973, APL (programming language)|APL was generally available only on mainframe computers, and most desktop sized microcomputers such as the Wang 2200 or HP 9800 series|HP 9800 offered only BASIC. Because SCAMP was the first to emulate APL/1130 performance on a portable, single user computer, ''PC Magazine'' in 1983 designated SCAMP a "revolutionary concept" and "the world's first personal computer".<ref name="www03.ibm.com" /><ref>''PC Magazine'', Vol. 2, No. 6, November 1983, ‘'SCAMP: The Missing Link in the PC's Past?‘’</ref> This seminal, single user portable computer now resides in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.. Successful demonstrations of the 1973 SCAMP prototype led to the IBM 5100 portable microcomputer launched in 1975 with the ability to be programmed in both APL and BASIC for engineers, analysts, statisticians, and other business problem-solvers. In the late 1960s such a machine would have been nearly as large as two desks and would have weighed about half a ton.<ref name="www03.ibm.com" />

Another desktop portable APL machine, the MCM/70, was demonstrated in 1973 and shipped in 1974.  It used the Intel 8008 processor.

A seminal step in personal computing was the 1973 Xerox Alto, developed at Xerox's PARC (company)|Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). It had a graphical user interface (GUI) which later served as inspiration for Apple's Macintosh, and Microsoft's Windows operating system. The Alto was a demonstration project, not commercialized, as the parts were too expensive to be affordable.<ref name="auto"/>

Also in 1973 HP 9800 series|Hewlett Packard introduced fully BASIC programmable microcomputers that fit entirely on top of a desk, including a keyboard, a small one-line display, and printer. The Wang 2200 microcomputer of 1973 had a full-size cathode ray tube (CRT) and cassette tape storage.<ref>cite web|title=The Wang 2200|url=http://www.wang2200.org/#2200|work=Wang2200.org|publisher=Jim Battle|accessdate=November 13, 2013|author=Jim Battle|date=August 9, 2008</ref> These were generally expensive specialized computers sold for business or scientific uses. The introduction of the microprocessor, a single integrated circuit|chip with all the circuitry that formerly occupied large cabinets, led to the proliferation of personal computers after 1975.

In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak sold the Apple I computer circuit board, which was fully prepared and contained about 30 chips. The Apple I computer differed from the other kit-style hobby computers of era. At the request of Paul Terrell, owner of the Byte Shop, Jobs and Wozniak were given their first purchase order, for 50 Apple I computers, only if the computers were assembled and tested and not a kit computer. Terrell wanted to have computers to sell to a wide range of users, not just experienced electronics hobbyists who had the soldering skills to assemble a computer kit. The Apple I as delivered was still technically a kit computer, as it did not have a power supply, case, or keyboard when it was delivered to the Byte Shop.

The first successfully mass marketed personal computer to be announced was the Commodore PET after being revealed in January 1977. However, it was back-ordered and not available until later that year.<ref name="Byte Feb 1978">Citation | author = What's New |date=February 1978 | title = Commodore Ships First PET Computers | journal = BYTE | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | page = 190  Commodore press release.

Together, these 3 machines were referred to as the "1977 trinity". Mass-market, ready-assembled computers had arrived, and allowed a wider range of people to use computers, focusing more on software applications and less on development of the processor hardware.

During the early 1980s, home computers were further developed for household use, with software for personal productivity, programming and games. They typically could be used with a television already in the home as the computer display, with low-detail blocky graphics and a limited color range, and text about 40 characters wide by 25 characters tall.

Somewhat larger and more expensive systems (for example, running CP/M), or sometimes a home computer with additional interfaces and devices, although still low-cost compared with minicomputers and Mainframe computer|mainframes, were aimed at office and small business use, typically using "high resolution" monitors capable of at least 80 column text display, and often no graphical or color drawing capability.
Workstations were characterized by high-performance processors and graphics displays, with large-capacity local disk storage, networking capability, and running under a multitasking operating system. Eventually, due to the influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market, personal computers and home computers lost any technical distinction. Business computers acquired color graphics capability and sound, and home computers and game systems users used the same processors and operating systems as office workers. Mass-market computers had graphics capabilities and memory comparable to dedicated workstations of a few years before. Even local area networking, originally a way to allow business computers to share expensive mass storage and peripherals, became a standard feature of personal computers used at home.

In 1982 "The Computer" was named Time Person of the Year|Machine of the Year by ''Time (magazine)|Time'' magazine. In the 2010s, several companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Sony sold off their PC and laptop divisions. As a result, the personal computer was declared dead several times during this period.<ref>cite web|last=Angler|first=Martin|title=Obituary: The PC is Dead|url=http://jackedin.martinangler.com/2014/02/obituary-personal-computer/|publisher=JACKED IN|accessdate=February 12, 2014</ref>

Before the widespread use of PCs, a computer that could fit on a desk was remarkably small, leading to the "desktop" nomenclature. More recently, the phrase usually indicates a particular style of computer case. Desktop computers come in a variety of styles ranging from large vertical tower cases to small models which can be tucked behind an LCD monitor.

The term "desktop" typically refers to a computer with a vertically aligned computer case that holds the systems [https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/hardware-1.html hardware] components such as the motherboard, processor chip, other internal operating parts. Desktop computers have an external monitor with a display screen and an external keyboard, which are plugged into [https://web.archive.org/web/20110208121819/http://www.usb.org/home USB] ports on the back of the computer case. Desktop computers are popular for [https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/H/home_computer.html home] and business computing applications as they leave space on the desk for Multi-monitor|multiple monitors.

All-in-one PCs (also known as single-unit PCs) are a subtype of desktop computer that combines the monitor and processor within a single unit. A separate keyboard and mouse  are standard input devices, with some monitors including touchscreen capability. The processor and other working components are typically reduced in size relative to standard desktops, located behind the monitor, and configured similarly to laptops.

 Nettop 
Main|Nettop

A subtype of desktops, called Nettop (computer)|nettops, was introduced by Intel in February 2008, characterized by low cost and lean functionality. A similar subtype of laptops (or notebooks) is the netbook, described below. The product line features the new Intel Atom processor, which specifically enables nettops to consume less power and fit into small enclosures.

 Home theater PC 
Main|Home theater PC
File:Home theater PC front with keyboard.jpg|right|thumb|An Antec Fusion V2 home theater PC, with a keyboard placed on top of it

A Home cinema|home theater PC (HTPC) is a convergence device that combines the functions of a personal computer and a digital video recorder. It is connected to a TV set or an appropriately sized computer display, and is often used as a digital photo viewer, music and video player, TV receiver, and digital video recorder. HTPCs are also referred to as media center systems or media servers. The general goal in a HTPC is usually to combine many or all components of a home cinema|home theater setup into one box. More recently, HTPCs gained the ability to connect to services providing on-demand movies and TV shows. HTPCs can be purchased pre-configured with the required hardware and software needed to add television programming to the PC, or can be cobbled together out of discrete components, what is commonly done with software support from MythTV, Windows Media Center, GB-PVR, SageTV, Famulent or LinuxMCE.

= Portable =

 Laptop 
Main|Laptop
File:MSI laptop with English Wikipedia screenshot 20100614.jpg|thumb|A laptop computer

A laptop computer (also called a notebook) is similar to a desktop, but is designed for portability. Usually, all of the hardware and interfaces needed to operate a laptop, such as the graphics card, audio devices or USB ports (previously parallel port|parallel and serial ports), are built into a single unit. Laptops usually have "Flip (form)|clamshell" design, in which the keyboard and computer components are on one panel and a flat display screen on a second panel, which is hinged to the first panel. The laptop is opened for use and closed for transport. Closing the laptop also protects the screen and keyboard during transportation. Laptops have both a power cable that can be plugged in and high-capacity battery (electricity)|batteries that can power the device, enhancing its portability. Once the battery charge is depleted, it will have to be recharged through a power outlet. In the interests of saving power, weight and space, laptop graphics cards are in many cases integrated into the CPU or chipset and use system RAM, resulting in reduced graphics performance when compared to an equivalent desktop machine. For this reason, desktop computers are usually preferred over laptops for Video game|gaming purposes.
 
One of the drawbacks of laptops is that, due to the size and configuration of components, usually relatively little can be done to upgrade the overall computer from its original design or add components. Internal upgrades are either not manufacturer-recommended, can damage the laptop if done with poor care or knowledge, or in some cases impossible, making the desktop PC more modular and upgradable. Desktop PCs typically have a case that has extra empty space inside, where users can install new components. Some internal upgrades to laptops, such as memory and hard disk drive upgrades are often easily performed, while a display or keyboard upgrade is usually difficult or impossible. Just like desktops, laptops also have the same input and output ports for connecting to a wide variety of devices, including external displays, mice, cameras, storage devices and keyboards, which may be attached externally through USB ports and other less common ports such as external video. Laptops are also a little more expensive compared to desktops, as the miniaturized components for laptops themselves are expensive.

A subtype of notebooks, called subnotebook, has most of the features of a standard laptop computer, but with smaller physical dimensions. Subnotebooks are larger than hand-held computers, and usually run full versions of desktop or laptop operating systems. Ultra-mobile PCs (UMPC) are usually considered subnotebooks, or more specifically, subnotebook tablet computer|tablet PCs, which are described below. Netbooks are sometimes considered to belong to this category, though they are sometimes separated into a category of their own (see below).

A desktop replacement computer (DTR) is a personal computer that provides the full capabilities of a desktop computer while remaining Mobile computing|mobile. Such computers are often actually larger, bulkier laptops. Because of their increased size, this class of computers usually includes more powerful components and a larger display than generally found in smaller portable computers, and can have a relatively limited battery capacity or none at all in some cases. Some use a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance at the expense of battery life. Desktop replacement computers are sometimes called ''desknotes'', as a portmanteau of words "desktop" and "notebook", though the term is also applied to desktop replacement computers in general.<ref>[http://www.news.com/2100-1040-979763.html Desktop notebooks stake their claim], accessed October 19, 2007</ref>

Some tablets may use a "hybrid" or "convertible" design, offering a keyboard that can either be removed as an attachment, or a screen that can be rotated and folded directly over top the keyboard. Some tablets may run a traditional PC operating system such as Windows or Linux; Microsoft attempted to enter the tablet market in 2002 with its Microsoft Tablet PC specifications, for tablets and convertible laptops running Windows XP. However, Microsoft's early attempts were overshadowed by the release of Apple's iPad; following in its footsteps, most tablets now run mobile operating systems such as Android (operating system)|Android and iOS.

Main|Personal computer hardware

Computer hardware is a comprehensive term for all physical parts of a computer, as distinguished from the data it contains or operates on, and the software that provides instructions for the hardware to accomplish tasks. The boundary between hardware and software has become blurred, with the existence of firmware that is software "built into" the hardware. For example, a 2010-era LCD display screen contains a small computer inside. Mass-market consumer computers use highly standardized components and so are simple for an end user to assemble into a working system. Most 2010s-era computers only require users to plug in the power supply, monitor, and other cables. A typical desktop computer consists of a computer case (or "tower"), a metal chassis that holds the Computer power supply|power supply, motherboard, hard disk drive, and often an optical disc drive. Most towers have empty space where users can add additional components. External devices such as a computer monitor or visual display unit, computer keyboard|keyboard, and a pointing device (Computer mouse|mouse) are usually found in a personal computer.

The motherboard connects all processor, memory and peripheral devices together. The RAM, graphics card and processor are in most cases mounted directly onto the motherboard. The central processing unit (microprocessor chip) plugs into a CPU socket, while the memory modules plug into corresponding memory sockets. Some motherboards have the video display adapter, sound and other peripherals integrated onto the motherboard, while others use expansion slots for graphics cards, network cards, or other Input/output|I/O devices.  The graphics card or sound card may employ a break out box to keep the analog parts away from the electromagnetic radiation inside the computer case. Disk drives, which provide mass storage, are connected to the motherboard with one cable, and to the power supply through another cable. Usually, disk drives are mounted in the same case as the motherboard; expansion chassis are also made for additional disk storage.

For large amounts of data, a tape drive can be used or extra hard disks can be put together in an external case. The keyboard and the mouse are external devices plugged into the computer through connectors on an I/O panel on the back of the computer case. The monitor is also connected to the input/output (I/O) panel, either through an onboard port on the motherboard, or a port on the graphics card. Capabilities of the personal computers hardware can sometimes be extended by the addition of expansion cards connected via an expansion computer bus|bus. Standard peripheral buses often used for adding expansion cards in personal computers include Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI, PCI Express (PCIe), and Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP (a high-speed PCI bus dedicated to graphics adapters, found in older computers). Most modern personal computers have multiple physical PCI Express expansion slots, with some of the having PCI slots as well.

A computer case is an enclosure that contains the main components of a computer. They are usually constructed from steel or aluminum combined with plastic, although other materials such as wood and tempered glass have been used for specialized units. Cases are available in different sizes and shapes; the size and shape of a computer case are usually determined by the configuration of the motherboard that it is designed to accommodate since this is the largest and most central component of most computers. The most popular style for desktop computers is ATX, although microATX and similar layouts became very popular for a variety of uses. Companies like Shuttle Inc. and Acer (company)|AOpen have popularized small cases, for which FlexATX is the most common motherboard size. In the 1990s, desktop computer cases were larger and taller than 2010-era computer cases.

File:PSU-Open1.jpg|right|thumb|Computer power supply unit with top cover removed

The power supply unit (PSU) converts general-purpose mains electricity|mains AC electricity to direct current (DC) for the other components of the computer. The rated output capacity of a PSU should usually be about 40% greater than the calculated system power consumption needs to be obtained by adding up all the system components. This protects against overloading the supply, and guards against performance degradation. Power supply capacities range from 250 to 2000  watts for desktop computers.

The central processing unit (CPU) is a part of a computer that executes instructions of a software computer program|program. In newer PCs, the CPU contains over a million transistors in one integrated circuit chip called the microprocessor. In most cases, the processor plugs directly into the motherboard. The processor chip may have a heat sink and a fan attached for cooling. A large number of computers today<ref>Cite journal|last=Baumann|first=Andrew|date=2017|title=Hardware is the new Software|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/baumann-hotos17.pdf|journal=Hot Topics in Operating Systems (HotOS)|volume=|pages=132–137|via=Microsoft</ref> are suited to run an x86-compatible microprocessor<ref name="Weidendorfer 2011"/> manufactured by Intel, AMD, or VIA Technologies.

= Motherboard =

The motherboard, also referred to as system board or main board, is the primary circuit board within a personal computer, and other major system components plug directly into it or via a cable. A motherboard contains a microprocessor, the central processing unit|CPU supporting circuitry (mostly integrated circuits) that provide the interface between  memory and input/output peripheral circuits, main memory, and facilities for initial setup of the computer immediately after power-on (often called boot firmware or, in IBM PC compatible computers, a BIOS or UEFI). In many portable and embedded personal computers, the motherboard houses nearly all of the PC's core components. Often a motherboard will also contain one or more peripheral buses and physical connectors for expansion purposes. Sometimes a secondary daughter board is connected to the motherboard to provide further expandability or to satisfy space constraints.

A PC's main memory is a fast primary storage device that is directly accessible by the CPU, and is used to store the currently executing program and immediately needed data. PCs use semiconductor random-access memory (RAM) of various kinds such as dynamic random access memory|DRAM, SDRAM or static random access memory|SRAM as their primary storage. Which exact kind is used depends on cost/performance issues at any particular time. Main memory is much faster than mass storage devices like hard disk drives or optical discs, but is usually volatile memory|volatile, meaning that it does not retain its contents (instructions or data) in the absence of power, and is much more expensive for a given capacity than is most mass storage. As a result, main memory is generally not suitable for long-term or archival data storage.

= Storage drive =
Main|Hard disk drive
See also|Solid state drive
File:35-Desktop-Hard-Drive.jpg|thumb|right|A 3.5" hard disk drive|hard drive with the cover removed.

Mass storage devices store programs and data even when the power is off; they do require power to perform read and write functions during usage. Although flash memory has dropped in cost, the prevailing form of mass storage in personal computers is still the hard disk drive. If the mass storage controller provides additional ports for expandability, a PC may also be upgraded by the addition of extra hard disk or optical disc drives. For example, Blu-ray|BD-ROMs, DVD-RWs, and various optical disc recorders may all be added by the user to certain PCs. Standard internal storage device connection interfaces are Parallel ATA|PATA, Serial ATA|SATA and SCSI. Solid state drives (SSDs) are a much faster replacement for traditional mechanical hard disk drives but are also more expensive in terms of cost per gigabyte. Solid state drives connect using several connectors, including SATA, M.2, and U.2. Some models use the NVM Express|NVMe protocol, which have vastly improved performance over standard hard disk drives and older SSDs that use the older Advanced Host Controller Interface|AHCI protocol.

= Visual display unit =
Main|Visual display unit

A visual display unit, computer monitor or just display, is a piece of electrical equipment, usually separate from the computer case, which displays visual images without producing a permanent computer record. A display device was usually a cathode ray tube|CRT in the 1980s, but by the 2000s, flat panel displays such as a TFT LCD had largely replaced the bulkier, heavier CRT screens. Multi-monitor setups are quite common in the 2010s, as they enable a user to display multiple programs at the same time (e.g., an email inbox and a word processing program). The display unit enclosure (electrical)|houses an electronic circuitry that generates its picture from signal (electrical engineering)|signals received from the computer. Within the computer, either integral to the motherboard or plugged into it as an expansion card, there is pre-processing circuitry to convert the microprocessor's output data (computing)|data to a format compatible with the display unit's circuitry.  The images from computer monitors originally contained only text, but as graphical user interfaces emerged and became common, they began to display more images and multimedia content. The term "monitor" is also used, particularly by technicians in broadcasting television, where a picture of the broadcast data is displayed to a highly standardized reference monitor for confidence checking purposes.

The video cardmdashotherwise called a graphics card, graphics adapter or video adaptermdashprocesses the graphics output from the motherboard and transmits it to the display. It is an essential part of modern multimedia-enriched computing. Graphics circuitry may be integrated with the motherboard, or may be on cards istalled in Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI, Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP, or PCI Express slots. When the IBM PC was introduced, most existing business-oriented personal computers used text-only display adapters and had no graphics capability. Home computers at that time had graphics compatible with television signals, but with low resolution owing to the limited memory available to the eight-bit processors available at the time.

File:ModelM.jpg|thumb|right|A Model M keyboard|"Model M" IBM computer keyboard from the early 1980s. Commonly called the "Clicky Keyboard" due to its buckling spring key spring design, which gives the keyboard its iconic 'click' sound with each keystroke.

A Computer keyboard|keyboard is an arrangement of buttons that each correspond to a function, letter, or number. They are the primary devices used for inputting text. In most cases, they contain an array of keys specifically organized with the corresponding letters, numbers, and functions printed or engraved on the button. They are generally designed around an operators language, and many different versions for different languages exist. In English, the most common layout is the QWERTY layout, which was originally used in typewriters. They have evolved over time, and have been modified for use in computers with the addition of function keys, number keys, arrow keys, and keys specific to an operating system. Often, specific functions can be achieved by pressing multiple keys at once or in succession, such as inputting characters with accents or opening a task manager. Programs use keyboard shortcuts very differently and all use different keyboard shortcuts for different program specific operations, such as refreshing a web page in a web browser or selecting all text in a word processor. In addition to the alphabetic keys found on a typewriter, computer keyboards typically have a numeric keyboard and a row of function keys and special keys, such as Control key|CTRL, Alt key|ALT, Delete key|DEL and Esc key|Esc

Many keyboards include LED lights under the keys that increase the visibility of the letters or symbols in dark environments.

A computer Computer mouse|mouse is a small handheld device that users hold and slide across a flat surface, pointing at various elements of a graphical user interface with an on-screen Cursor (computing)|cursor, and selecting and moving objects using the mouse buttons. Mice may be plugged into a dedicated mouse socket, or a USB port, or, may be connected wirelessly. Mice include one or more buttons to allow a user to signal the computer to carry out some operation, such as selecting an item from  a menu of choices on the screen.  A mouse may have a scroll wheel, to allow users to move the displayed image. The scroll wheel can also be pressed down, and used as a third button. Some mouse wheels may be tilted from side to side to allow sideways scrolling. Different programs make use of these functions differently, and may scroll horizontally by default with the scroll wheel, open different menus with different buttons, etc. These functions may be also user-defined through software utilities. Mechanical mice used a ball, which drove pulse generators to detect movement along "north-south" or "east-west" axies. Optical mice use a special mouse pad with a printed grid to allow detection of motion, or else use an imaging chip that allows detection of motion on almost any opaque surface.

All computers require either fixed or removable storage for their operating system, programs and user-generated material. Early home computers used Compact Cassette|compact audio cassettes for file storage; these were at the time a very low cost storage solution, but were displaced by floppy disk drives when manufacturing costs dropped, by the mid-1980s. Initially, the 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch floppy drives were the principal forms of removable storage for backup of user files and distribution of software.  As memory sizes increased, the capacity of the floppy did not keep pace; the Zip drive and other higher-capacity removable media were introduced but never became as prevalent as the floppy drive. By the late 1990s, the optical drive, in CD and later DVD and Blu-ray Disc forms, became the main method for software distribution, and writeable media provided means for data backup and file interchange. As a result, floppy drives became uncommon in desktop personal computers since about 2000, and were dropped from many laptop systems even earlier.<ref group=note>The NeXT computer introduced in 1988 did not include a floppy drive, which at the time was unusual.</ref>

A second generation of tape recorders was provided when videocassette recorders were pressed into service as backup media for larger disk drives. All these systems were less reliable and slower than purpose-built magnetic tape drives. Such tape drives were uncommon in consumer-type personal computers but were a necessity in business or industrial use. Interchange of data such as photographs from digital cameras is greatly expedited by installation of a card reader, which is often compatible with several forms of flash memory devices. It is usually faster and more convenient to move large amounts of data by removing the card from the mobile device, instead of communicating with the mobile device through a USB interface.

A USB flash drive performs much of the data transfer and backup functions formerly done with floppy drives, Zip disks and other devices. Mainstream operating systems for personal computers provide built-in support for USB flash drives, allowing interchange even between computers with different processors and operating systems. The compact size and lack of moving parts or dirt-sensitive media, combined with low cost and high capacity, have made USB flash drives a popular and useful accessory for any personal computer user.

The operating system can be located on any storage, but is typically installed on a hard disk or solid-state drive. A Live CD represents the concept of running an operating system directly from a CD. While this is slow compared to storing the operating system on a hard disk drive, it is typically used for installation of operating systems, demonstrations, system recovery, or other special purposes. Large flash memory is currently more expensive than hard disk drives of similar size (as of mid-2014) but are starting to appear in laptop computers because of their low weight, small size and low power requirements. Computer communications involve Softmodem|internal modem cards, modems, Network card|network adapter cards, and Router (computing)|routers.  Common peripherals and adapter cards include Headset (audio)|headsets, joysticks, microphones, Computer printer|printers, Image scanner|scanners, Sound card|sound adapter cards (as a separate card rather than located on the motherboard), Loudspeaker|speakers and webcams.

Software applications are common for word processing, Internet browsing, Internet faxing, e-mail and other digital messaging, multimedia playback, playing of computer game, and computer programming. The user may have significant knowledge of the operating environment and application programs, but is not necessarily interested in programming nor even able to write programs for the computer. Therefore, most software written primarily for personal computers tends to be designed with simplicity of use, or "usability|user-friendliness" in mind. However, the software industry continuously provide a wide range of new products for use in personal computers, targeted at both the expert and the non-expert user.

An operating system (OS) manages computer resources and provides programmers with an User interface|interface used to access those resources. An operating system processes system data and user input, and responds by allocating and managing tasks and internal system resources as a service to users and programs of the system. An operating system performs basic tasks such as controlling and allocating Computer data storage|memory, prioritizing system requests, controlling input/output|input and output devices, facilitating computer networking, and managing files.

Common contemporary desktop operating systems are Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris (operating system)|Solaris and FreeBSD. Windows, macOS, and Linux all have server and personal variants. With the exception of Microsoft Windows, the designs of each of them were inspired by or directly inherited from the Unix operating system, which was developed at Bell Labs beginning in the late 1960s and spawned the development of numerous free and proprietary operating systems.

 macOS 
Main|macOS

macOS (formerly OS&nbsp;X) is a line of operating systems developed, marketed and sold by Apple Inc. macOS is the successor to the original Classic Mac OS|Mac OS, which had been Apple's primary operating system since 1984. macOS is a Unix-based graphical user interfaces|graphical operating system, and Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard, Mac OS X Leopard|Leopard, Mac OS X Lion|Lion, OS X Mountain Lion|Mountain Lion, OS X Mavericks|Mavericks, OS X Yosemite|Yosemite, OS X El Capitan|El Capitan and macOS Sierra|Sierra are its version codenames. The most recent version of macOS is codenamed macOS Mojave. The macOS is based upon the Mach kernel. Certain parts from FreeBSD's and NetBSD's implementation of Unix were incorporated in NeXTSTEP, the core of Mac OS X. Most libraries and utilities are from FreeBSD, but some are derived from NetBSD. For future development, OS X has adopted FreeBSD as a reference code base for Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD technology. Work is ongoing to more closely synchronize all BSD tools and libraries with the FreeBSD-stable branch..

 FreeBSD 
Main|FreeBSD
FreeBSD is an operating system for a variety of platforms which focuses on features, speed, and stability. It is derived from 4.4BSD, the version of Unix|UNIX developed at the University of California, Berkeley. It is developed and maintained by a large community. While FreeBSD is popular as a server for its performance and stability, it is also suited for day-to-day use as a desktop. With over 30,000 applications available as FreeBSD packages or ports, it is easy to build a customized desktop that runs  a wide variety of desktop applications. Some specific projects in this category include improved FUSE support, Linuxulator improvements, Intel graphics support, WiFi improvements, 802.11ac support, and driver updates, and work to finish and integrate the packaged base effort. Usually, many people consider servers when thinking of FreeBSD, but FreeBSD also continues to run well on client devices (laptops and desktops). This allows developers to test their work as well as the work of others on an ongoing basis under a variety of usage conditions. In addition, technologies often transition from being perceived as relevant only to client devices to being a critical requirement for servers – for example, power management. It has OpenZFS integration which is an open source file system and Logical volume management|logical volume manager originally designed by Sun Microsystems. There is also two downstream projects known as TrueOS, which is a bit "cutting-edge FreeBSD", and Project Trident, which is a desktop-focused operating system based on TrueOS.

 Linux

End-user development tailors systems to meet the user's specific needs. User-written software include spreadsheet templates, word processor macros, scientific simulations, graphics and animation scripts; even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.

=Average selling price=
Selling prices of personal computers steadily declined due to lower costs of production and manufacture, while the capabilities of computers increased. In 1975, an Altair kit sold for only around US$400, but required customers to solder components into circuit boards; peripherals required to interact with the system in alphanumeric form instead of blinking lights would add another $2,000, and the resultant system was only of use to hobbyists.<ref name=Sussman85>Marvin B. Sussman ''Personal Computers and the Family'' Routledge, 1985 ISBN|0-86656-361-X, p. 90.</ref>

At their introduction in 1981, the US$1,795 price of the Osborne 1 and its competitor Kaypro was considered an attractive price point; these systems had text-only displays and only floppy disks for storage. By 1982, Michael Dell observed that a personal computer system selling at retail for about $3,000 US was made of components that cost the dealer about $600; typical gross margin on a computer unit was around $1,000.<ref>Kateri M. Drexler ''Icons of business: an encyclopedia of mavericks, movers, and shakers, Volume 1'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, ISBN|0-313-33863-9, p. 102</ref> The total value of personal computer purchases in the US in 1983 was about $4 billion, comparable to total sales of pet food. By late 1998, the average selling price of personal computer systems in the United States had dropped below $1,000.<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/9150/average_pc_price_drops_below_1000.html Nancy Weil, ''Average PC Price drops below $1000'', ''PC World'' December 1998.

For Microsoft Windows systems, the average selling price (ASP) showed a decline in 2008/2009, possibly due to low-cost netbooks, drawing $569 for desktop computers and $689 for laptops at U.S. retail in August 2008. In 2009, ASP had further fallen to $533 for desktops and to $602 for notebooks by January and to $540 and $560 in February.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Netbooks-Are-Destroying-the-Laptop-Market-and-Microsoft-Needs-to-Act-Now-863307/ |title=Netbooks Are Destroying the Laptop Market and Microsoft Needs to Act Now |publisher=eWeek |author=Joe Wilcox |date=April 16, 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-14</ref> According to research firm NPD Group|NPD, the average selling price of all Windows portable PCs has fallen from $659 in October 2008 to $519 in October 2009.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.cio.com/article/509556/Falling_PC_Prices_Pit_Microsoft_Against_PC_Makers |title=Falling PC Prices Pit Microsoft Against PC Makers |author=Shane O'Neill |date=December 2, 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-14</ref>

Environmental impact

Main|Computer recycling
External costs of environmental impact are not fully included in the selling price of personal computers. This impact differs between desktop computers and laptops.<ref>cite web|last1=Mattison|first1=Richard|title=The true cost of personal computers|url=https://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2012/10/03/true-cost-personal-computers|website=GreenBiz|publisher=GreenBiz Group Inc.|accessdate=28 September 2016|date=2012-10-03</ref>

Personal computers have become a large contributor to the 50 million tons of discarded electronic waste that is being generated annually, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. To address the electronic waste issue affecting developing countries and the environment, Extended producer responsibility|extended producer responsibility (EPR) acts have been implemented in various countries and states.<ref>cite journal|last1=Nash|first1=Jennifer|last2=Bosso|first2=Christopher|title=Extended Producer Responsibility in the United States: Full Speed Ahead?|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|date=2013|volume=17 | issue = 2 – RPP–2013–04|pages=175–185|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/centers-programs/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/Nash_Bosso_2013-10.pdf|accessdate=August 23, 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00572.x</ref> Organizations, such as the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, Basel Action Network, Toxics Link India, SCOPE, and Greenpeace have contributed to these efforts. In the absence of comprehensive national legislation or regulation on the export and import of electronic waste, the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition and BAN (Basel Action Network) teamed up with 32 electronic recyclers in the US and Canada to create an e-steward program for the orderly disposal of manufacturers' and customers' electronic waste. The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition founded the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, a coalition that advocates for the production of environmentally friendly products. The TakeBack Coalition works with policy makers, recyclers, and smart businesses to get manufacturers to take full responsibility of their products. There are organizations opposing EPR regulation, such as the Reason Foundation. They see flaws in two principal tenets of EPR: First EPR relies on the idea that if the manufacturers have to pay for environmental harm, they will adapt their practices. Second EPR assumes the current design practices are environmentally inefficient. The Reason Foundation claims that manufacturers naturally move toward reduced material and energy use.
