A cypherpunk anonymous remailer is a Type I anonymous remailer that takes messages encrypted with Pretty Good Privacy|PGP or GNU Privacy Guard|GPG, or in some cases in plain text, and forwards them removing any identifying  information from the header.

Sending a Cypherpunk Message

Step 1:  Retrieving the remailer's Public Key.

:Generally you can get a Cypherpunk remailer's public key by sending an email message with the subject "remailer-key" to the server you wish to use.

Step 2:  Import remailer's public keys into Pretty Good Privacy|PGP or GNU Privacy Guard|GPG.

Step 3:  Compose Message

:Compose the message in your favorite text editor, using the following template:

<pre>::
Anon-To: <Recipient Email Address>

##
Subject: <Subject>

<Message Text>
</pre>

Step 4: Encrypt Message

:Use Pretty Good Privacy|PGP or GNU Privacy Guard|GPG to encrypt the message that you just composed using the remailer's public key.

Step 5: Send Encrypted Message to Remailer

:Prepare an email to send to the Cypherpunk remailer using the following template:

<pre>
::
Encrypted: PGP

-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
<place encrypted output here>
-----END PGP MESSAGE-----
</pre>

:Then send it.

Notes

* The extra headers are called 'pseudoheaders' because they do not appear in the RFC 822 headers specification for email.
* Messages to Cypherpunk remailers may be layered so they route through several different Cypherpunk remailers to decrease the odds of anyone determining who the sender is.
* Some Cypherpunk remailers are also Mixmaster anonymous remailers and can split long Cypherpunk messages into Mixmaster packets and send them to the next remailer, if it also understands Mixmaster.
* Many Cypherpunk remailer users will repeat steps 1-4 to wrap their message in additional layers to route it through several remailers for additional privacy and security.
