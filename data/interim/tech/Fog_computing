 Concept 
Fog computing can be perceived both in large cloud systems and big data structures, making reference to the growing difficulties in accessing information objectively. This results in a lack of quality of the obtained content. The effects of fog computing on cloud computing and big data systems may vary. However, a common aspect is a limitation in accurate content distribution, an issue that has been tackled with the creation of metrics that attempt to improve accuracy.<ref>Cite book|url = http://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&articleid=mesh_2013_2_20_40038|title = XMPP Distributed Topology as a Potential Solution for Fog Computing|last = Bar-Magen Numhauser|first = Jonathan|date = August 25, 2013|journal = MESH 2013 the Sixth International Conference on Advances in Mesh Networks|pages = 26–32|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |isbn = 9781612082998</ref>

Fog networking consists of a control plane and a data plane. For example, on the data plane, fog computing enables computing services to reside at the edge of the network as opposed to servers in a data-center. Compared to cloud computing, fog computing emphasizes proximity to end-users and client objectives, dense geographical distribution and local resource pooling, latency reduction and backbone bandwidth savings to achieve better quality of service (QoS)<ref>Cite journal|last=Brogi|first=Antonio|last2=Forti|first2=Stefano|date=2017|title=QoS-aware Deployment of IoT Applications Through the Fog|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7919155/|journal=IEEE Internet of Things Journal|volume=PP|issue=99|pages=1185–1192|doi=10.1109/JIOT.2017.2701408|issn=2327-4662</ref> and edge analytics/stream mining, resulting in superior user-experience<ref name="CiscoFog">Cisco RFP-2013-078.

Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command|SPAWAR, a division of the US Navy, is prototyping and testing a scalable, secure Disruption Tolerant Mesh Network to protect strategic military assets, both stationary and mobile. Machine control applications, running on the mesh nodes, "take over", when internet connectivity is lost. Use cases include Internet of Things e.g. smart drone swarms.<ref>''[http://meshdynamics.com/documents/ABSTRACTED-NETWORK-FOR-IOT.pdf].''</ref>

ISO/IEC 20248 provides a method whereby the data of objects identified by edge computing using Automated Identification Data Carriers [AIDC], a barcode and/or RFID tag, can be read, interpreted, verified and made available into the "Fog" and on the "Edge," even when the AIDC tag has moved on.<ref>Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dupGDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&dq=ISO/IEC+20248+provides+a+method+whereby+the+data+of+objects+identified+by+edge+computing+using+Automated+Identification+Data+Carriers+%5BAIDC%5D,+a+barcode+and/or+RFID+tag,+can+be+read,+interpreted,+verified+and+made+available+into+the+%22Fog%22+and+on+the+%22Edge%22+even+when+the+AIDC+tag+has+moved+on.#v=onepage&q=AIDC&f=false|title=Mobile Cloud Computing: Foundations and Service Models|last=Huang|first=Dijiang|last2=Wu|first2=Huijun|date=2017-09-08|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=9780128096444|language=en</ref>

 Motivation 
There are many factors that make this an interesting paradigm to study.
Each client/edge device in the past several years as become powerful in its capabilities. For instance, the original iPhone had a single core 412&nbsp;MHz ARM processor with 128&nbsp;MB RAM and 8&nbsp;GB storage space. The current iPhone 5S on the other hand carries a dual-core 1.3&nbsp;GHz Apple A7 processor with 1GB RAM, 64 GB storage space and enhanced GPU capabilities. Intel’s mobile chip Atom and Nvidia’s Tegra too promise near similar specifications. The increase in strength and capabilities implies complex functionality such as CPU/GPU intensive gaming, powerful location/context tracking sensors and enhanced storage.

Fog computing can be much more cognitive of end user application experience since it is much “closer” to the data then traditional cloud computing. Due to the rise of encrypted traffic and multipath-TCP in the  core network, the network provider and the cloud service provider are often unable to extract and understand features specific to the users. Fog applications are not as limited since they may often reside on or near the end user, granting it access to raw user data.

The need for fog applications has been brought further into focus by the clear trend towards cell densification in the 5G framework with multiple small base-stations covering shorter areas. Can they act as miniature LTE-cores coordinating with a centralized LTE core serving only those functionalities that cannot be carried out by the edge?

 Architecture 
The functionality of Fog networking can be studied according to the traditional functional planes

EDD (Edge-driven Data Center): On the data-plane, distributed data centers, mobile CDN, and edge caching are various manifestations of the Fog. And a goal of Fog networking research is to investigate the optimization of resources that are virtualized, pooled, and shared in unpredictable way.
EDC (Edge-driven Control Plane): On the (much less appreciated) control plane and its many functionalities, Fog Networking revisits the role of the edge devices in network architectures as an integral part of the control plane that monitors, measures, and manages the  network.

 Applications 
While there has been many applications in the past in the world of P2P networks, sensor networks and mobile adhoc networks (MANETs) there are many applications that can be conceived such as:

* Edge caching/BW management at home gateway/small cell (industrial automation)
* Edge analytics and real-time stream-mining
* IoT session management and signaling load optimization
* Client-driven distributed beam-forming/content sharing
* Clients’ idle computing/storage resource pooling
* Cloudlets/Mobile CDN
* FlashLinQ/LTE Direct/WiFi Direct/AirDrop
* Over The Top (OTT) content management

History
In 2012, the need to extend cloud computing with fog computing emerged, in order to cope with huge number of IoT devices and big data volumes for real-time low-latency applications.<ref>Cite book|last=Bonomi|first=Flavio|last2=Milito|first2=Rodolfo|last3=Zhu|first3=Jiang|last4=Addepalli|first4=Sateesh|date=2012-08-17|title=Fog computing and its role in the internet of things|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2342509.2342513|publisher=ACM|pages=13–16|doi=10.1145/2342509.2342513|isbn=9781450315197</ref>

Definition
Both cloud computing and fog computing provide storage, applications, and data to end-users. However, fog computing has a closer proximity to end-users and bigger geographical distribution.<ref>F. Bonomi, R. Milito, J. Zhu, and S. Addepalli, "Fog computing and its role in the internet of things," in Proceedings of the First Edition of the MCC Workshop on Mobile Cloud Computing, ser. MCC’12.

Cloud computing – the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.<ref>Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cloud_computing|title=cloud computing !

Fog computing – a term created by Cisco that refers to extending cloud computing to the edge of an enterprise's network. Also known as edge computing or fogging, fog computing facilitates the operation of compute, storage, and networking services between end devices and cloud computing data centers. While edge computing is typically referred to the location where services are instantiated, fog computing implies distribution of the communication, computation, and storage resources and services on or close to devices and systems in the control of end-users.<ref>Cite book|last=Zhang|first=Chiang|date=2016|title=Fog and IoT: An Overview of Research Opportunities|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7498684/|journal= IEEE Internet of Things Journal|volume=3|issue=6|pages=854–864|doi=10.1109/EuCNC.2017.7980667|pmid=|access-date=|via=|isbn=978-1-5386-3873-6</ref><ref>Cite journal|last=Ostberg et al.|date=2017|title=Reliable Capacity Provisioning for Distributed Cloud/Edge/Fog Computing Applications|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7980667/|journal=Networks and Communications (EuCNC), 2017 European Conference on|volume=3|issue=6|pages=854–864|doi=10.1109/JIOT.2016.2584538|pmid=|access-date=|via=</ref> Fog computing is a medium weight and intermediate level of computing power.<ref>Cite journal|last=Perera|first=Charith|last2=Qin|first2=Yongrui|last3=Estrella|first3=Julio C.|last4=Reiff-Marganiec|first4=Stephan|last5=Vasilakos|first5=Athanasios V.|date=2017-10-09|title=Fog Computing for Sustainable Smart Cities: A Survey|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3101309.3057266|journal=ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)|volume=50|issue=3|pages=32|doi=10.1145/3057266|issn=0360-0300</ref> Rather than a substitute, fog computing often serves as a complement to cloud computing.<ref>Cite journal|last=Matt|first=Christian|date=2018-04-19|title=Fog Computing|journal=Business & Information Systems Engineering|volume=60|issue=4|language=en|pages=351–355|doi=10.1007/s12599-018-0540-6|issn=2363-7005</ref> 

National Institute of Standards and Technology in March, 2018 released a definition of fog computing adopting much of Cisco's commercial terminology as NIST Special Publication 500-325, ''Fog Computing Conceptual Model'', that defines fog computing as an horizontal, physical or virtual resource paradigm that resides between smart end-devices and traditional cloud computing or data center.<ref>Cite web|url=https://newsroom.cisco.com/feature-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1894659|title=Fog brings the cloud closer to the ground: Cisco innovates in fog computing|website=newsroom.cisco.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-24</ref> This paradigm supports vertically-isolated, latency-sensitive applications by providing ubiquitous, scalable, layered, federated, and distributed computing, storage, and network connectivity. Thus fog computing is most distinguished by distance from the edge. As per the theoretical model of fog computing, fog computing nodes are physically and functionally operative  between edge nodes and centralized cloud.<ref>Cite journal|last=Sarkar|first=S.|last2=Misra|first2=S.|date=2016|title=Theoretical modelling of fog computing: a green computing paradigm to support IoT applications|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7437623|journal=IET Networks|volume=5|issue=2|pages=23–29|doi=10.1049/iet-net.2015.0034|issn=2047-4954</ref> Much of the terminology is not defined including key architectural terms like "smart" and the distinction between fog computing from edge computing does not have generally agreed acceptance. Fog computing is also considered to be more energy efficient as compared to cloud computing.<ref>Cite journal|last=Sarkar|first=S.|last2=Chatterjee|first2=S.|last3=Misra|first3=S.|date=2018|title=Assessment of the Suitability of Fog Computing in the Context of Internet of Things|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7286781|journal=IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing|volume=6|issue=1|pages=46–59|doi=10.1109/TCC.2015.2485206|issn=2168-7161|via=</ref>
