Tor is free and open-source software for enabling Internet anonymity|anonymous communication. The name is derived from an acronym for the original software project name "The Onion Router".<ref name="onion-router" /><ref>cite web |title=Tor Project: FAQ |url=https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#WhyCalledTor |website=www.torproject.org |accessdate=18 January 2016</ref> Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network consisting of more than seven thousand relays<ref name="torstatus" /> to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting Computer surveillance#Network surveillance|network surveillance or Traffic analysis#In computer security|traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity to the user: this includes "visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms".<ref name="nyt-navels" /> Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities from being monitored.

Tor does not prevent an online service from determining when it is being accessed through Tor. Tor protects a user's privacy, but does not hide the fact that someone is using Tor. Some websites restrict allowances through Tor. For example, the MediaWiki :mediawikiwiki:Extension:TorBlock|TorBlock extension automatically restricts edits made through Tor, although Wikipedia allows Wikipedia:Advice to users using Tor|some limited editing in exceptional circumstances.<ref>cite news |title=Turks Click Away, but Wikipedia Is Gone |author=PATRICK KINGSLEY |date=June 10, 2017 |publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/world/europe/turkey-wikipedia-ban-recep-tayyip-erdogan.html |accessdate=June 11, 2017</ref>

Onion routing is implemented by encryption in the application layer of a communication protocol stack, nested like the layers of an onion. Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination IP address, multiple times and sends it through a virtual circuit comprising successive, random-selection Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of encryption to reveal the next relay in the circuit to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing or knowing the source IP address. Because the routing of the communication was partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single point at which the communicating peers can be determined through network surveillance that relies upon knowing its source and destination.<ref name="Termanini2018">cite book|author=Rocky Termanini|title=The Nano Age of Digital Immunity Infrastructure Fundamentals and Applications: The Intelligent Cyber Shield for Smart Cities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVNPDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT210|date=5 March 2018|publisher=CRC Press (Taylor & Francis Group)|isbn=978-1-351-68287-9|pages=210–211</ref>

File:Geographies of Tor.png|thumb|A cartogram illustrating Tor usage

The core principle of Tor, "onion routing", was developed in the mid-1990s by United States Naval Research Laboratory employees, mathematician Paul Syverson, and computer scientists Michael G.

The alpha version of Tor, developed by Syverson and computer scientists Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson<ref name="pando"/> and then called The Onion Routing project, or Tor project, launched on 20 September 2002.<ref name="prealpha" /><ref name="torproject-faq" /> The first public release occurred a year later.<ref>cite web|last1=Dingledine|first1=Rogert|title=Tor is free|url=https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2003-October/002185.html|website=Tor-dev Mail List|publisher=Tor Project|accessdate=23 September 2016</ref> On 13 August 2004, Syverson, Dingledine, and Mathewson presented "Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router" at the 13th USENIX Security Symposium.<ref name="usenix-design" /> In 2004, the Naval Research Laboratory released the code for Tor under a free license, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) began funding Dingledine and Mathewson to continue its development.<ref name="pando"/>

In December 2006, Dingledine, Mathewson, and five others founded The Tor Project, Inc|The Tor Project, a Massachusetts-based 501(c)(3) research-education nonprofit organization responsible for maintaining Tor.<ref name="torproject-corepeople" /> The Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF acted as The Tor Project's Fiscal sponsorship|fiscal sponsor in its early years, and early financial supporters of The Tor Project included the U.S. International Broadcasting Bureau, Internews, Human Rights Watch, the University of Cambridge, Google, and Netherlands-based NLnet|Stichting NLnet.<ref>cite web |url=https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2008-TorProject-Form990.pdf |title=Tor Project Form 990 2008 |date=2009 |accessdate=30 August 2014 |website=Tor Project</ref><ref>cite web |url=https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2007-TorProject-Form990.pdf |title=Tor Project Form 990 2007 |date=2008 |accessdate=30 August 2014 |website=Tor Project</ref><ref>cite web |url=https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2009-TorProject-Form990andPC.pdf |title=Tor Project Form 990 2009 |date=2010 |accessdate=30 August 2014 |website=Tor Project</ref><ref name="torproject-sponsors" /><ref name="wp-attacks-prompt" />

From this period onward, the majority of funding sources came from the U.S. government.<ref name="pando"/>

In November 2014 there was speculation in the aftermath of Operation Onymous that a Tor weakness had been exploited.<ref name=Wired-2014-11-07/> A BBC source cited a "technical breakthrough"<ref name=BBC-2014-11-07 /> that allowed the tracking of the physical locations of servers.

In March 2015 the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology released a briefing which stated that "There is widespread agreement that banning online anonymity systems altogether is not seen as an acceptable policy option in the U.K." and that "Even if it were, there would be technical challenges." The report further noted that Tor "plays only a minor role in the online viewing and distribution of indecent images of children" (due in part to its inherent latency); its usage by the Internet Watch Foundation, the utility of its onion services for whistleblowers, and its circumvention of the Great Firewall of China were touted.<ref name="The Daily Dot">cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/uk-briefing-tor-child-abuse-minor-role/ |title=U.K. Parliament says banning Tor is unacceptable and impossible |first=Patrick Howell |last=O'Neill |date=9 March 2015 |website=The Daily Dot |accessdate=19 April 2015</ref>

The Tor Project's FAQ offers supporting reasons for the EFF's endorsement:

quote|Criminals can already do bad things. Since they're willing to break laws, they already have lots of options available that provide better privacy than Tor provides....

Tor aims to provide protection for ordinary people who want to follow the law. Only criminals have privacy right now, and we need to fix that....

So yes, criminals could in theory use Tor, but they already have better options, and it seems unlikely that taking Tor away from the world will stop them from doing their bad things. At the same time, Tor and other privacy measures can fight identity theft, physical crimes like stalking, and so on.|source=Tor Project FAQ<ref name="torproject-faq-abuse" />

Operation
Multiple image|image1=Tor-onion-network.png|caption1=Infographic about how Tor works, by Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF

Tor aims to conceal its users' identities and their online activity from surveillance and traffic analysis by separating identification and routing. It is an implementation of onion routing, which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ encryption in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure perfect forward secrecy between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in network location. That anonymity extends to the hosting of censorship-resistant content by Tor's anonymous onion service feature.<ref name="usenix-design" /> Furthermore, by keeping some of the entry relays (bridge relays) secret, users can evade Internet censorship that relies upon blocking public Tor relays.<ref name="torproject-bridges" />

Because the IP address of the sender and the recipient are not ''both'' in cleartext at any hop along the way, anyone eavesdropping at any point along the communication channel cannot directly identify both ends. Furthermore, to the recipient it appears that the last Tor Node (networking)|node (called the exit node), rather than the sender, is the originator of the communication.

=Originating traffic=
File:EtherApeTorScreenShot.png|thumb|A visual depiction of the traffic between some Tor relay Node (networking)|nodes from the open-source software|open-source packet sniffing program EtherApe
A Tor user's SOCKS-aware applications can be configured to direct their network traffic through a Tor instance's SOCKS interface, which is listening on TCP port 9150 at localhost.<ref>cite web |url= https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2018-12&post=TorPCAP---Tor-Network-Forensics |title= TorPCAP - Tor Network Forensics |website= Netresec |accessdate= 12 December 2018</ref> Tor periodically creates virtual circuits through the Tor network through which it can multiplexing|multiplex and onion-route that traffic to its destination. Once inside a Tor network, the traffic is sent from router to router along the circuit, ultimately reaching an exit node at which point the cleartext packet is available and is forwarded on to its original destination. Viewed from the destination, the traffic appears to originate at the Tor exit node.

Tor's application independence sets it apart from most other anonymity networks: it works at the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) stream level. Applications whose traffic is commonly anonymized using Tor include Internet Relay Chat (IRC), instant messaging, and World Wide Web browsing.

=Onion servicesanchor|Hidden services=
See also|List of Tor onion services
Tor can also provide anonymity to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called onion services (formerly, hidden services).<ref>cite web |last1=Winter |first1=Philipp |title=How Do Tor Users Interact With Onion Services? |url=https://nymity.ch/onion-services/pdf/sec18-onion-services.pdf |accessdate=27 December 2018</ref> Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), an onion service is accessed through its .onion|onion address, usually via the #Tor Browser|Tor Browser. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding public keys and ''introduction points'' from a distributed hash table within the network. It can route data to and from onion services, even those hosted behind firewall (computing)|firewalls or network address translators (NAT), while preserving the anonymity of both parties. Tor is necessary to access these onion services.<ref name="torproject-conf-hidden" />

Onion services were first specified in 2003<ref>cite web|last1=Mathewson|first1=Nick|title=Add first draft of rendezvous point document|url=https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/commit/?id=3d538f6d702937c23bec33b3bdd62ff9fba9d2a3|website=Tor Source Code|accessdate=23 September 2016</ref> and have been deployed on the Tor network since 2004.<ref name="or-locating" /> Other than the database that stores the onion service descriptors,<ref name="torproject-hidden" /> Tor is decentralized by design; there is no direct readable list of all onion services, although a number of onion services catalog publicly known onion addresses.

Because onion services route their traffic entirely through the Tor network, connection to an onion service is encrypted end-to-end and not subject to eavesdropping. There are, however, security issues involving Tor onion services. For example, services that are reachable through Tor onion services ''and'' the public Internet are susceptible to correlation attacks and thus not perfectly hidden. Other pitfalls include misconfigured services (e.g. identifying information included by default in web server error responses), uptime and downtime statistics, intersection attacks, and user error.<ref name="torproject-hidden" /><ref name="register-embassy-passwd" /> The open-source software|open source OnionScan program, written by independent security researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis, comprehensively examines onion services for numerous flaws and vulnerabilities.<ref name="OnionScan">Cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kb7bg3/onionscan-checks-if-your-dark-web-site-really-is-anonymous |title=A Tool to Check If Your Dark Web Site Really Is Anonymous: 'OnionScan' will probe dark web sites for security weaknesses

=Nyx status monitor=

Nyx (formerly ARM) is a Command-line interface|command-line status monitor written in Python programming language|Python for Tor.<ref>cite web |title=Nyx |url=https://nyx.torproject.org/ |website=nyx.torproject.org |language=en</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/arm.1.html |title=Ubuntu Manpage: arm – Terminal Tor status monitor |website=Ubuntu.com</ref> This functions much like Top (Unix)|top does for system usage, providing real time statistics for:
* resource usage (bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage)
* general relaying information (nickname, fingerprint, flags, or/dir/controlports)
* event log with optional Regular expression|regex filtering and deduplication
* connections correlated against Tor's consensus data (ip, connection types, relay details, etc.)
* torrc configuration file with syntax highlighting and validation

Most of Nyx's attributes are configurable through an optional armrc configuration file. It runs on any platform supported by Curses (programming library)|curses including Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like variants.

The project began in the summer of 2009,<ref name="arm introductory blog posting">cite web |url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/summer-conclusion-arm-project |title=Summer Conclusion (ARM Project) |website=torproject.org |accessdate=19 April 2015</ref><ref name="arm interview">cite web |url=https://www.atagar.com/arm/resources/HFM_INT_0001.mp3 |title=Interview with Damien Johnson by Brenno Winter |website=atagar.com |accessdate=4 June 2016</ref> and since 18 July 2010 it has been an official part of the Tor Project. It is free software, available under the GNU General Public License.

Weaknesses
Like all current low latency|low-latency anonymity networks, Tor cannot and does not attempt to protect against monitoring of traffic at the boundaries of the Tor network (i.e., the traffic entering and exiting the network). While Tor does provide protection against traffic analysis, it cannot prevent traffic confirmation (also called ''end-to-end correlation'').<ref name="torproject-one-cell" /><ref name="torproject-fail-both-ends" />

In spite of known weaknesses and attacks listed here, a 2009 study revealed Tor and the alternative network system Java Anon Proxy|JonDonym (Java Anon Proxy, JAP) are considered more resilient to Device fingerprint|website fingerprinting techniques than other tunneling protocols.

The reason for this is conventional single-hop VPN protocols do not need to reconstruct packet data nearly as much as a multi-hop service like Tor or JonDonym. Website fingerprinting yielded greater than 90% accuracy for identifying HTTP packets on conventional VPN protocols versus Tor which yielded only 2.96% accuracy. However some protocols like OpenSSH and OpenVPN required a large amount of data before HTTP packets were identified.<ref name="ccsw-attacking" />

Researchers from the University of Michigan developed a network scanner allowing identification of 86% of live Tor "bridges" with a single scan.<ref name="twe-zmap" />

=Eavesdropping=

 Autonomous system (AS) eavesdropping 
If an Autonomous System (Internet)|autonomous system (AS) exists on both path segments from a client to entry relay and from exit relay to destination, such an AS can statistically correlate traffic on the entry and exit segments of the path and potentially infer the destination with which the client communicated. In 2012, LASTor proposed a method to predict a set of potential ASes on these two segments and then avoid choosing this path during path selection algorithm on client side. In this paper, they also improve latency by choosing shorter geographical paths between client and destination.<ref name="LASTor-2012" />

 Exit node eavesdropping 
In September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed he had intercepted usernames and passwords for e-mail accounts by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes.<ref name="wired-rogue-nodes" /> As Tor cannot encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture traffic passing through it that does not use end-to-end encryption such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS). While this may not inherently breach the anonymity of the source, traffic intercepted in this way by self-selected third parties can expose information about the source in either or both of payload and protocol data.<ref name="sf-tor-hack" /> Furthermore, Egerstad is circumspect about the possible subversion of Tor by intelligence agencies:<ref name="smh-hack-of-year" />

quote|"If you actually look in to where these Tor nodes are hosted and how big they are, some of these nodes cost thousands of dollars each month just to host because they're using lots of bandwidth, they're heavy-duty servers and so on. Who would pay for this and be anonymous?"

In October 2011, a research team from ESIEA (university)|ESIEA claimed to have discovered a way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it.<ref name="thn-compromised" /><ref name="01-chercheurs" /> The technique they describe requires creating a map of Tor network nodes, controlling one third of them, and then acquiring their encryption Key (cryptography)|keys and algorithm Random seed|seeds. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical-based attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a denial-of-service attack. A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating these rumours of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.<ref name="torproject-rumors-exaggerated" />

=Traffic-analysis attack=
There are two methods of traffic-analysis attack, passive and active. In passive traffic-analysis method, the attacker extracts features from the traffic of a specific flow on one side of the network and looks for those features on the other side of the network. In active traffic-analysis method, the attacker alters the timings of the packets of a flow according to a specific pattern and looks for that pattern on the other side of the network; therefore, the attacker can link the flows in one side to the other side of the network and break the anonymity of it.<ref name=":0">Cite book|last=Soltani|first=Ramin|last2=Goeckel|first2=Dennis|last3=Towsley|first3=Don|last4=Houmansadr|first4=Amir|date=2017-11-27|arxiv=1711.10079|doi=10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335179|title=2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers|pages=258–262|isbn=978-1-5386-1823-3</ref>  It is shown, although timing noise is added to the packets, there are active traffic analysis methods robust against such a noise.<ref name=":0" />

Steven Murdoch|Steven J. Murdoch and George Danezis from University of Cambridge presented an article at the 2005 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE Symposium on security and privacy on traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries with only a partial view of the network to infer which nodes are being used to relay the anonymous streams.<ref name="ieee-low-cost" /> These techniques greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Murdoch and Danezis have also shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. This attack, however, fails to reveal the identity of the original user.<ref name="ieee-low-cost" /> Murdoch has been working with and has been funded by Tor since 2006.

=Tor exit node block=
Operators of Internet sites have the ability to prevent traffic from Tor exit nodes or to offer reduced functionality to Tor users. For example, it is not generally possible to edit Wikipedia when using Tor or when using an IP address also used by a Tor exit node, due to the use of the mw:Extension:TorBlock|TorBlock MediaWiki extension, unless an Wikipedia:IP block exemption|exemption is obtained. The BBC blocks the IP addresses of all known Tor guards and exit nodes from its iPlayer service – however relays and bridges are not blocked.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/help/troubleshooting/tv-games-consoles/in_the_uk_message|title=BBC iPlayer Help – Why does BBC iPlayer think I'm outside the UK?|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-10</ref>

=Bad apple attack=
In March 2011, researchers with the Rocquencourt French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique, INRIA), documented an attack that is capable of revealing the IP addresses of BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent users on the Tor network. The "bad apple attack" exploits Tor's design and takes advantage of insecure application use to associate the simultaneous use of a secure application with the IP address of the Tor user in question. One method of attack depends on control of an exit node or hijacking tracker responses, while a secondary attack method is based in part on the statistical exploitation of distributed hash table tracking.<ref name="usenix-bad-apple" /> According to the study:<ref name="usenix-bad-apple" />

The results presented in the bad apple attack research paper are based on an attack in the wild launched against the Tor network by the authors of the study. The attack targeted six exit nodes, lasted for twenty-three days, and revealed a total of 10,000 IP addresses of active Tor users. This study is significant because it is the first documented attack designed to target Peer-to-peer|P2P file-sharing applications on Tor.<ref name="usenix-bad-apple" /> BitTorrent may generate as much as 40% of all traffic on Tor.<ref name="shining-light" /> Furthermore, the bad apple attack is effective against insecure use of any application over Tor, not just BitTorrent.<ref name="usenix-bad-apple" />

=Some protocols expose IP addresses=
Researchers from the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA) showed that the Tor dissimulation technique in BitTorrent can be bypassed by attackers controlling a Tor exit node. The study was conducted by monitoring six exit nodes for a period of twenty-three days. Researches used three attack vectors:<ref name="manils-compromising" />
;Inspection of BitTorrent control messages: Tracker announces and extension protocol handshakes may optionally contain client IP address. Analysis of collected data revealed that 35% and 33% of messages, respectively, contained addresses of clients.<ref name="manils-compromising" />rp|3
;Hijacking trackers' responses: Due to lack of encryption or authentication in communication between tracker and peer, typical man-in-the-middle attacks allow attackers to determine peer IP addresses and even verify the distribution of content. Such attacks work when Tor is used only for tracker communication.<ref name="manils-compromising" />rp|4
;Exploiting distributed hash tables (DHT): This attack exploits the fact that distributed hash table (DHT) connections through Tor are impossible, so an attacker is able to reveal a target's IP address by looking it up in the DHT even if the target uses Tor to connect to other peers.<ref name="manils-compromising" />rp|4–5

With this technique, researchers were able to identify other streams initiated by users, whose IP addresses were revealed.<ref name="manils-compromising" />

=Sniper attack=
Jansen ''et al''., describe a DDoS attack targeted at the Tor node software, as well as defenses against that attack and its variants. The attack works using a colluding client and server, and filling the queues of the exit node until the node runs out of memory, and hence can serve no other (genuine) clients. By attacking a significant proportion of the exit nodes this way, an attacker can degrade the network and increase the chance of targets using nodes controlled by the attacker.<ref name="andssy-sniper" />

=Heartbleed bug=
The Heartbleed bug|Heartbleed OpenSSL Computer bug|bug disrupted the Tor network for several days in April 2014 while private keys were renewed. The Tor Project recommended Tor relay operators and onion service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted Tor relays use two sets of keys and Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay.<ref name="torproject-openssl-cve" /> 586 relays later found to be susceptible to the Heartbleed bug were taken off-line as a precautionary measure.<ref name="ml-rejecting" /><ref name="torproject-news-20140416" /><ref name="ars-ranks-cut" /><ref name="tp-blacklisting" />
anchor | Relay early attack<!-- there are links here; please don't move/remove without fixing the links -->

= Relay early traffic confirmation attack =
On 30 July 2014 the Tor Project issued a security advisory "'relay early' traffic confirmation attack" in which the project discovered a group of relays that tried to deanonymize onion service users and operators.<ref>harvp | Dingledine |2014 "On July 4, 2014 we found a group of relays that we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services."</ref>
In summary, the attacking onion service directory node changed the headers of cells being relayed tagging them as "relay" or "relay early" cells differently to encode additional information and sent them back to the requesting user/operator.  If the user's/operator's guard/entry node was also part of the attacking relays, the attacking relays might be able to capture the IP address of the user/operator along with the onion service information that the user/operator was requesting.  The attacking relays were stable enough to achieve being designated as "suitable as hidden service directory" and "suitable as entry guard"; therefore, both the onion service users and the onion services might have used those relays as guards and hidden service directory nodes.<ref name=relay-early-attack>cite web | ref = harv | last = Dingledine | first = Roger | date = 30 July 2014 | title = Tor security advisory: "relay early" traffic confirmation attack | url = https://blog.torproject.org/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack | publisher = The Tor Project </ref>

The project discovered that the attacking nodes joined the network early in the year on 30 January and the project removed them on 4 July.<ref name=relay-early-attack /> 
Although when the attack began was unclear, the project implied that between February and July, onion service users' and operators' IP addresses might be exposed.<ref>harvp | Dingledine |2014 "...we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services... users who operated or accessed hidden services from early February through July 4 should assume they were affected... We know the attack looked for users who fetched hidden service descriptors... The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service...  Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service."</ref>

In the same advisory, the project mentioned the following mitigations for the attack besides removing the attacking relays from the network
* patched relay software to prevent relays from relaying cells with "relay early" headers that were not intended.<ref>harvp | Dingledine |2014 "Relays should upgrade to a recent Tor release (0.2.4.23 or 0.2.5.6-alpha), to close the particular protocol vulnerability the attackers used..."</ref>
* planned update for users' proxy software so that they could inspect if they received "relay early" cells from the relays (as they are not supposed to),<ref>harvp | Dingledine |2014 "For expert users, the new Tor version warns you in your logs if a relay on your path injects any relay-early cells: look for the phrase 'Received an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell'"</ref> along with the settings to connect to just one guard node instead of selecting randomly from 3 to reduce the probability of connecting to an attacking relay<ref>harvp | Dingledine |2014 "Clients that upgrade (once new Tor Browser releases are ready) will take another step towards limiting the number of entry guards that are in a position to see their traffic, thus reducing the damage from future attacks like this one... 3) Put out a software update that will (once enough clients have upgraded) let us tell clients to move to using one entry guard rather than three, to reduce exposure to relays over time."</ref>
* recommended that onion services might want to change their locations<ref>harvp | Dingledine |2014 "Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service."</ref>
* reminded users and onion service operators that Tor could not prevent deanonymization if the attacker controlled or could listen to both ends of the Tor circuit, the class of attack that this attack belonged to<ref>harvp | Dingledine |2014 "...but remember that preventing traffic confirmation in general remains an open research problem."</ref>

In November 2014 there was speculation in the aftermath of Operation Onymous, resulting in 17 arrests internationally, that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of Europol was secretive about the method used, saying: "''This is something we want to keep for ourselves. The way we do this, we can’t share with the whole world, because we want to do it again and again and again.''"<ref name=Wired-2014-11-07>Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/11/operation-onymous-dark-web-arrests |title=Global Web Crackdown Arrests 17, Seizes Hundreds Of Dark Net Domains|first=Andy |last=Greenberg |journal=Wired |date=7 November 2014 |accessdate=9 August 2015</ref>
A BBC source cited a "technical breakthrough"<ref name=BBC-2014-11-07>Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29950946 |title=Huge raid to shut down 400-plus dark net sites –  |first=Jane |last=Wakefield |newspaper=BBC News |date=7 November 2014 |accessdate=9 August 2015</ref>
that allowed the tracking of the physical locations of servers, and the number of sites that police initially claimed to have infiltrated led to speculation that a weakness in the Tor network had been exploited. This possibility was downplayed by Andrew Lewman, a representative of the Tor project, suggesting that execution of more traditional police work was more likely.<ref name=crisis>cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/tor-crisis-of-confidence/ |title=The truth behind Tor's confidence crisis |website=The Daily Dot |first=Patrick Howell |last=O'Neill |date=7 November 2014 |accessdate=10 November 2014</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www.techspot.com/news/58751-operation-onymous-seizes-hundreds-darknet-sites-17-arrested.html |title=Operation Onymous seizes hundreds of darknet sites, 17 arrested globally |website=Techspot |first=Shawn |last=Knight |date=7 November 2014 |accessdate=8 November 2014</ref>

* the search warrant for an administrator of Silkroad 2.0 indicated that from January 2014 until July, the FBI received information from "university-based research institute" with the information being "reliable IP addresses for TOR and hidden services such as SR2" that led to the identification of "at least another seventeen black markets on TOR" and "approximately 78 IP addresses that accessed a vendor .onion address." One of these IP addresses led to the arrest of the administrator<ref name=Motherboard2015 />
* the chronology and nature of the attack fitted well with the operation<ref name=Motherboard2015 />
* a senior researcher of International Computer Science Institute, part of University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview that the institute which worked with the FBI was "almost certainly" Carnegie Mellon University (CMU),<ref name=Motherboard2015 /> and this concurred with the Tor Project's assessment<ref name=tor-blog-FBI /> and with an earlier analysis of Edward Felten, a computer security professor at Princeton University, about researchers from CMU's CERT/CC being involved<ref name=Felton2014>cite web | authors = Felten, Ed | date = 31 July 2014 | title = Why were CERT researchers attacking Tor? | url = https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/why-were-cert-researchers-attacking-tor/ | publisher = Freedom to Tinker, Center for Information Technology Policy, Princeton University </ref>
In his analysis published on 31 July, besides raising ethical issues, Felten also questioned the fulfilment of CERT/CC's purposes which were to prevent attacks, inform the implementers of vulnerabilities, and eventually inform the public. Because in this case, CERT/CC's staff did the opposite which was to carry out large-scale long-lasting attack, withhold vulnerability information from the implementers, and withhold the same information from the public.<ref name=Felton2014 /> CERT/CC is a non-profit, computer security research organization Government spending|publicly funded through the US federal government.

Firefox / Tor browser attack

Advocates for Tor say it supports freedom of expression, including in countries where the Internet is censored, by protecting the privacy and anonymity of users. The mathematical underpinnings of Tor lead it to be characterized as acting "like a piece of infrastructure, and governments naturally fall into paying for infrastructure they want to use".<ref>cite web |url=http://pando.com/2014/12/09/clearing-the-air-around-tor/ |title=Clearing the air around Tor |website=PandoDaily |first=Quinn |last=Norton |date=9 December 2014</ref>

The project was originally developed on behalf of the U.S. intelligence community and continues to receive U.S. government funding, and has been criticized as "more resembl[ing] a spook project than a tool designed by a culture that values accountability or transparency".<ref name="pando" /> as of|2012, 80% of The Tor Project's $2M annual budget came from the United States government, with the U.S. State Department, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the National Science Foundation as major contributors,<ref name="boston-free-speech-tech" /> aiming "to aid democracy advocates in authoritarian states".<ref name="NDR" /> Other public sources of funding include DARPA, the United States Naval Research Laboratory|U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and the Government of Sweden.<ref name="torproject-sponsors" /><ref name="wsj-anonymous-contraversial" /> Some have proposed that the government values Tor's commitment to free speech, and uses the darknet to gather intelligence.<ref>Moore, Daniel; Rid, Thomas.

In March 2011, The Tor Project received the Free Software Foundation's 2010 Award for Projects of Social Benefit.

In 2013, Jacob Appelbaum described Tor as a "part of an ecosystem of software that helps people regain and reclaim their autonomy.

 Improved security 
Tor responded to earlier vulnerabilities listed above by patching them and improving security. In one way or another, human (user) errors can lead to detection. The Tor Project website provides best practices (instructions) on how to properly use the Tor browser. When improperly used, Tor is not secure. For example, Tor warns its users that not all traffic is protected; only the traffic routed through the Tor browser is protected. Users are also warned to use https versions of websites, not to BitTorrent|torrent with Tor, not to enable browser plugins, not to open documents downloaded through Tor while online, and to use safe bridges.<ref>[https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#warning "Want Tor to Really Work?" – Tor Project]</ref> Users are also warned that they cannot provide their name or other revealing information in web forums over Tor and stay anonymous at the same time.<ref name=stayan>cite web|title=Tor: Overview – Staying anonymous|url=https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en|accessdate=21 September 2016</ref>

Despite intelligence agencies' claims that 80% of Tor users would be de-anonymized within 6 months in the year 2013,<ref name="arstechnica.com">cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/building-a-new-tor-that-withstands-next-generation-state-surveillance/|title=Building a new Tor that can resist next-generation state surveillance|website=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=2016-08-31</ref> that has still not happened. In fact, as late as September 2016, FBI could not locate, de-anonymize and identify the Tor user who hacked into the email account of a staffer on Hillary Clinton's email server.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3771474/Clinton-email-server-hit-dark-web-tools-Hillary-worried-hacked-getting-send-link-porn.html|title=Clinton feared hack after getting porn link sent to her secret email|website=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=2016-09-02</ref>

The best tactic of law enforcement agencies to de-anonymize users appears to remain with Tor-relay adversaries running poisoned nodes, as well as counting on the users themselves using Tor browser improperly. E.g., downloading video through Tor browser and then opening the same file on an unprotected hard drive while online can make the users' real IP addresses available to authorities.<ref>cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/aussie-cops-ran-child-porn-site-for-months-revealed-30-us-ips/|title=Aussie cops ran child porn site for months, revealed 30 US IPs|website=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=2016-08-16</ref>

= Odds of detection =
When properly used, odds of being de-anonymized through Tor are said to be extremely low. Tor project's cofounder Nick Mathewson recently explained that the problem of "Tor-relay adversaries" running poisoned nodes means that a theoretical adversary of this kind is not the network's greatest threat:

quotation|"No adversary is truly global, but no adversary needs to be truly global," he says. "Eavesdropping on the entire Internet is a several-billion-dollar problem. Running a few computers to eavesdrop on a lot of traffic, a selective denial of service attack to drive traffic to your computers, that's like a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars problem." At the most basic level, an attacker who runs two poisoned Tor nodes—one entry, one exit—is able to analyse traffic and thereby identify the tiny, unlucky percentage of users whose circuit happened to cross both of those nodes. At present the Tor network offers, out of a total of around 7,000 relays, around 2,000 guard (entry) nodes and around 1,000 exit nodes. So the odds of such an event happening are one in two million (1/2000 x 1/1000), give or take.<ref name="arstechnica.com"/>

Tor does not provide protection against Timing attack|end-to-end timing attacks: if an attacker can watch the traffic coming out of the target computer, and also the traffic arriving at the target's chosen destination (e.g. a server hosting a .onion site), he can use statistical analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit.<ref name=stayan/>

= Levels of security =
Depending on individual user needs, Tor browser offers three levels of security located under Onion tab > Security Settings. In addition to encrypting the data, including constantly changing IP address through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays, several other layers of security are at user's disposal:

1. Low (default) – at this security level, all browser features are enabled.

– This level provides the most usable experience, and the lowest level of security.

2. Medium – at this security level, the following changes apply:

– HTML5 video and audio media become click-to-play via NoScript.

– On sites where JavaScript is enabled, performance optimizations are disabled. Scripts on some sites may run slower.

– Some mechanisms of displaying math equations are disabled.

– Some font rendering features are disabled.

– JavaScript is disabled by default on all non-HTTPS sites.

3. High – at this security level, these additional changes apply:

– JavaScript is disabled by default on all sites.

– Some types of images are disabled.

– Some fonts and icons may display incorrectly.
