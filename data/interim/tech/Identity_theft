Identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else's personally identifiable information|identity, usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person's name,<ref>Synthetic ID Theft [http://www.unc.edu/~dubal/idtheft/synthetic.htm Cyber Space Times] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009122632/http://www.unc.edu/~dubal/idtheft/synthetic.htm |date=October 9, 2015 </ref><ref>Cite web |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=969441 |title=Identity Theft: Making the Known Unknowns Known |last=Hoofnagle|first=Chris Jay |date=13 March 2007 |website=Social Science Research Network|access-date=</ref> and perhaps to the other person's disadvantage or loss. The person whose identity has been assumed may suffer adverse consequences,<ref name="BloombergIdentityTheftEssay">cite web |author=Drew Armstrong | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-13/my-three-years-in-identity-theft-hell | title=My Three Years in Identity Theft Hell | work= | publisher=Bloomberg | date=September 13, 2017 |isbn= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919142519/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-13/my-three-years-in-identity-theft-hell | archive-date=2017-09-19 | access-date=2017-09-20 </ref> especially if they are held responsible for the perpetrator's actions. Identity theft occurs when someone uses another's personally identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term ''identity theft'' was coined in 1964.<ref>cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50111220/50111220se23  |title=Oxford English Dictionary online|date=September 2007 |work= |publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 September 2010 </ref> Since that time, the definition of identity theft has been statutorily prescribed throughout both the U.K. and the United States as the theft of personally identifying information, generally including a person’s name, date of birth, social security number, driver’s license number, bank account or credit card numbers, PIN numbers, electronic signatures, fingerprints, passwords, or any other information that can be used to access a person’s financial resources.<ref>See, e.g., cite web|title=Wisconsin Statutes, Sec. 943.201. Unauthorized use of an individual's personal identifying information or documents.|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/943/III/201|website=Wisconsin State Legislature|accessdate=19 July 2017</ref>

Determining the link between data breaches and identity theft is challenging, primarily because identity theft victims often do not know how their personal information was obtained, and identity theft is not always detectable by the individual victims, according to a report done for the Federal Trade Commission|FTC.<ref>Federal Trade Commission – 2006 Identity Theft Survey Report, p. 4</ref> Identity fraud is often but not necessarily the consequence of identity theft. Someone can steal or misappropriate personal information without then committing identity theft using the information about every person, such as when a major data breach occurs. A US Government Accountability Office study determined that "most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft".<ref>cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07737.pdf |title=Data Breaches Are Frequent, but Evidence of Resulting Identity Theft Is Limited; However, the Full Extent Is Unknown |author= |date= |work=Highlights of GAO-07-737, a report to congressional requesters |publisher=gao.gov |accessdate=22 September 2010</ref> The report also warned that "the full extent is unknown". A later unpublished study by Carnegie Mellon University noted that "Most often, the causes of identity theft is not known", but reported that someone else concluded that "the probability of becoming a victim to identity theft as a result of a data breach is ... around only 2%".<ref>cite web |url=http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/research/241full.pdf |title=Do Data Breach Disclosure Laws Reduce Identity Theft? |author=Sasha Romanosky |date= |work=Heinz First Research Paper |publisher=heinz.cmu.edu |accessdate=</ref> More recently, an association of consumer data companies noted that one of the largest data breaches ever, accounting for over four million records, resulted in only about 1,800 instances of identity theft, according to the company whose systems were breached.

An October 2010 article entitled "Cyber Crime Made Easy" explained the level to which hackers are using malicious software.<ref name="Giles2010">cite journal | last=Giles | first=Jim | title=Cyber crime made easy | journal=New Scientist | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=205 | issue=2752 | year=2010 | issn=0262-4079 | doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(10)60647-1 | pages=20–21</ref> As Gunter Ollmann,
Chief Technology Officer of security at Microsoft, said, "Interested in credit card theft?  There's an app for that."  This statement summed up the ease with which these hackers are accessing all kinds of information online.  The new program for infecting users' computers was called Zeus (malware)|Zeus; and the program is so hacker-friendly that even an inexperienced hacker can operate it.  Although the hacking program is easy to use, that fact does not diminish the devastating effects that Zeus (or other software like Zeus) can do to a computer and the user.  For example, the article stated that programs like Zeus can steal credit card information, important documents, and even documents necessary for homeland security.  If the hacker were to gain this information, it would mean identity theft or even a possible terrorist attack. The Integrated Threat Assessment Centre|ITAC says that about 15 million Americans are having their identity stolen, in 2012.<ref>https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/vit12.pdf</ref>

 Types 
Sources such as the non-profit Identity Theft Resource Center<ref>cite web |url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org/ |title=Identity Theft Resource Center website |author= |date= |work= |publisher=idtheftcenter.org |accessdate=  </ref> sub-divide identity theft into five categories:
* Criminal identity theft (posing as another person when apprehended for a crime)
* Financial identity theft (using another's identity to obtain credit, goods and services)
* Identity cloning (using another's information to assume his or her identity in daily life)
* Medical identity theft (using another's identity to obtain medical care or drugs)
* Child identity theft.

Identity theft may be used to facilitate or fund other crimes including illegal immigration, terrorism, phishing and espionage. There are cases of identity cloning to attack payment systems, including online credit card processing and medical insurance.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/medidtheft_consumertips.html |title=Medical Identity Theft: What to Do if You are a Victim (or are concerned about it) , World Privacy Forum</ref>

= Identity cloning and concealment =
In this situation the identity thief impersonates someone else in order to conceal their own true identity. Examples are illegal immigrants hiding their illegal status, people hiding from creditors or other individuals, and those who simply want to become "Anonymity|anonymous" for personal reasons. Another example is ''posers'', a label given to people who use someone else's photos and information on social networking sites. Posers mostly create believable stories involving friends of the real person they are imitating. Unlike identity theft used to obtain credit which usually comes to light when the debts mount, concealment may continue indefinitely without being detected, particularly if the identity thief is able to obtain false credentials in order to pass various authentication tests in everyday life.

= Criminal identity theft =
When a criminal fraudulently identifies themselves to police as another individual at the point of arrest, it is sometimes referred to as "Criminal Identity Theft." In some cases, criminals have previously obtained state-issued identity documents using credentials stolen from others, or have simply presented a fake ID. Provided the subterfuge works, charges may be placed under the victim's name, letting the criminal off the hook. Victims might only learn of such incidents by chance, for example by receiving a court summons, discovering their drivers licenses are suspended when stopped for minor traffic violations, or through background checks performed for employment purposes.

It can be difficult for the victim of a criminal identity theft to clear their record. The steps required to clear the victim's incorrect criminal record depend in which jurisdiction the crime occurred and whether the true identity of the criminal can be determined. The victim might need to locate the original arresting officers and prove their own identity by some reliable means such as fingerprinting or DNA testing, and may need to go to a court hearing to be cleared of the charges. Obtaining an expungement of court records may also be required. Authorities might permanently maintain the victim's name as an alias for the criminal's true identity in their criminal records databases. One problem that victims of criminal identity theft may encounter is that various data aggregators might still have the incorrect criminal records in their databases even after court and police records are corrected. Thus it is possible that a future background check will return the incorrect criminal records.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs17g-CrimIdTheft.htm |title=Privacy Rights Clearinghouse |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs17g-CrimIdTheft.htm |archivedate=2012-09-21 |df=  - "Fact Sheet 17g: Criminal Identity Theft: What to Do if It Happens to You "</ref> This is just one example of the kinds of impact that may continue to affect the victims of identity theft for some months or even years after the crime, aside from the psychological trauma that being 'cloned' typically engenders.

= Synthetic identity theft =
A variation of identity theft which has recently become more common is ''synthetic identity theft'', in which identities are completely or partially fabricated.<ref>[http://www.leagle.com/decision/2009567417bbr150_1566 In re Marie A. COLOKATHIS, Catherine Bauer, M.D., Plaintiff v. Marie Colokathis, 417 B.R. 150 (2009)] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719051854/http://www.leagle.com/decision/2009567417bbr150_1566 |date=July 19, 2015 </ref> The most common technique involves combining a real social security number with a name and birthdate other than the ones associated with the number. Synthetic identity theft is more difficult to track as it doesn't show on either person's credit report directly but may appear as an entirely new file in the credit bureau or as a subfile on one of the victim's credit reports. Synthetic identity theft primarily harms the creditors who unwittingly grant the fraudsters credit. Individual victims can be affected if their names become confused with the synthetic identities, or if negative information in their subfiles impacts their credit ratings.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/pf/identity_theft_20070516_a1.asp |title=Detecting synthetic identity fraud |accessdate=2008-09-21 |last=McFadden |first=Leslie |date=2007-05-16 |work=Bankrate.com |pages=1–2 |doi=   |quote=  </ref>

= Medical identity theft =
see also|medical privacy
Privacy researcher Pam Dixon, the founder of the World Privacy Forum,<ref>https://www.worldprivacyforum.org/</ref> coined the term medical identity theft and released the first major report about this issue in 2006. In the report, she defined the crime for the first time and made the plight of victims public. The report's definition of the crime is that medical identity theft occurs when someone seeks medical care under the identity of another person. Insurance theft is also very common, if a thief has your insurance information and or your insurance card, they can seek medical attention posing as yourself.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.igrad.com/articles/8-types-of-identity-theft|title=Get to Know These Common Types of ID Theft|website=iGrad|access-date=2016-09-29</ref>  In addition to risks of financial harm common to all forms of identity theft, the thief's medical history may be added to the victim's medical records. Inaccurate information in the victim's records is difficult to correct and may affect future insurability or cause doctors relying on the misinformation to deliver inappropriate care. After the publication of the report, which contained a recommendation that consumers receive notifications of medical data breach incidents, California passed a law requiring this, and then finally HIPAA was expanded to also require medical breach notification when breaches affect 500 or more people.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/medicalidentitytheft.html|title=The Medical Identity Theft Information Page|author=|date=|work=|publisher=World Privacy Forum|accessdate=26 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416062351/http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/medicalidentitytheft.html|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org/artman2/publish/v_fact_sheets/Fact_Sheet_130_A_Correcting_Misinformation_on_Medical_Records.shtml |title=Correcting Misinformation on Medical Records |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Identity Theft Resource Center |accessdate=</ref> Data collected and stored by hospitals and other organizations such as medical aid schemes is up to 10 times more valuable to cybercriminals than credit card information.

= Child identity theft =
Child identity theft occurs when a minor's identity is used by another person for the impostor's personal gain. The impostor can be a family member, a friend, or even a stranger who targets children. The Social Security numbers of children are valued because they do not have any information associated with them.  Thieves can establish lines of credit, obtain driver's licenses, or even buy a house using a child's identity. This fraud can go undetected for years, as most children do not discover the problem until years later.  Child identity theft is fairly common, and studies have shown that the problem is growing. The largest study on child identity theft, as reported by Richard Power of the Carnegie Mellon Cylab with data supplied by AllClear ID, found that of 40,000 children, 10.2% were victims of identity theft.citation needed|date=September 2016

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) estimates that about nine million people will be victims of identity theft in the United States per year. It was also estimated that in 2008 630,000 people under the age of 19 were victims of theft. This then gave them a debt of about $12,799 which was not theirs.<ref name=":5">Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A317310399/AONE?u=sunybuff_main&sid=AONE&xid=8502170b.|title=Protecting and defending a young person in foster care from financial identity theft|last=Clemente|first=Jean|date=Feb 2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=</ref>

Not only are children in general big targets of identity theft but children who are in foster care are even bigger targets. This is because they are most likely moved around quite frequently and their SSN is being shared with multiple people and agencies. Foster children are even more victims of identity theft within their own family and other relatives. Young people in foster care who are victims of this crime are usually left alone to struggle and figure out how to fix their newly formed bad credit.<ref name=":5" />

= Financial identity theft =
The most common type is financial identity theft, where someone wants to gain economical benefits in someone else's name. This includes getting credits, loans, goods and services, claiming to be someone else.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org/Identity-Theft/what-is-financial-identity-theft.html |title=What is Financial Identity Theft |author= |date= |work= |publisher=ID Theft Center |accessdate=3 December 2014</ref>

= Tax Identity Theft =
One of the major identity theft categories is Tax Identity Theft. Tax Identity theft occurs when someone gains another persons information and uses that to receive a tax refund. The thief in this case can also try to get a job and then their employer will report the income of the real taxpayer, this then results in the taxpayer getting in trouble with the IRS.<ref name=":03">Cite web|url=https://www.citrincooperman.com/infocus/identity-theft-tax-and-financial-consideration|title=Identity Theft; Tax and Financial Consideration|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=</ref>

The [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf 14039 Form] to the Internal Revenue Service|IRS<nowiki/>is a form that will help one fight against a theft like tax theft. This form will put the IRS on alert and someone who believed they have been a victim of tax related theft will be given a Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN), which is a 6 digit code used in replace of a SSN for filing tax returns.<ref name=":03" />

 Techniques for obtaining and exploiting personal information for identity theft 
Identity thieves typically obtain and exploit personally identifiable information about individuals, or various credentials they use to authenticate themselves, in order to impersonate them. Examples include:
* Rummaging through rubbish for personal information (Dumpster diving#Information diving|dumpster diving)
* Retrieving personal data from redundant IT equipment and storage media including PCs, servers, PDAs, mobile phones, USB memory sticks and hard drives that have been disposed of carelessly at public dump sites, given away or sold on without having been properly sanitized
* Using public records about individual citizens, published in official registers such as electoral rolls<ref>cite news | last=Loviglio | first=Joann| url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46874551/ns/technology_and_science-security/#.T3OtcyKF_9J| title= If Microsoft co-founder's ID isn't safe, is yours? | work= msnbc.com |date= March 2012 </ref>
* Stealing bank or credit cards, identification cards, passports, authentication tokens ... typically by pickpocketing, burglary|housebreaking or mail theft
* Common-knowledge questioning schemes that offer account verification and compromise: "What's your mother's maiden name?", "what was your first car model?", or "What was your first pet's name?", etc.
* Skimming (credit card fraud)|Skimming information from bank or credit cards using compromised or hand-held card readers, and creating clone cards
* Using Wireless identity theft|'contactless' credit card readers to acquire data wirelessly from RFID-enabled passports
* Shoulder-Surfing, involves an individual who discreetly watches or hears others providing valuable personal information. This is particularly done in crowded places because it is relatively easy to observe someone as they fill out forms, enter PIN numbers on ATMs or even type passwords on smartphones.
* Stealing personal information from computers using breaches in browser security or malware such as Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse keystroke logging programs or other forms of spyware
* Hacker (computer security)|Hacking computer networks, systems and databases to obtain personal data, often in large quantities
* Exploiting Data breach|breaches that result in the publication or more limited disclosure of personal information such as names, addresses, Social Security number or credit card numbers
* Advertising bogus job offers in order to accumulate curriculum vitae|resumes and applications typically disclosing applicants' names, home and email addresses, telephone numbers and sometimes their banking details
* Exploiting insider access and abusing the rights of privileged IT users to access personal data on their employers' systems
* Infiltrating organizations that store and process large amounts or particularly valuable personal information
* Impersonating trusted organizations in emails, SMS text messages, phone calls or other forms of communication in order to dupe victims into disclosing their personal information or login credentials, typically on a fake corporate website or data collection form (phishing)
* Brute-force attacking weak passwords and using inspired guesswork to compromise weak password reset questions
* Obtaining castings of fingers for falsifying fingerprint identification.
* Browsing social network service|social networking websites for personal details published by users, often using this information to appear more credible in subsequent social engineering activities
* Diverting victims' email or post in order to obtain personal information and credentials such as credit cards, billing and bank/credit card statements, or to delay the discovery of new accounts and credit agreements opened by the identity thieves in the victims' names
* Using false pretenses to trick individuals, customer service representatives and help desk workers into disclosing personal information and login details or changing user passwords/access rights (pretexting)
* Stealing Cheque|cheques (checks) to acquire banking information, including account numbers and bank codes<ref>cite web |url=http://www.douglascountysheriff.org/idtheft/idtheftmain.htm |title=Identity Theft , Douglas County Sheriff's Office, Washington</ref>
* Guessing Social Security numbers by using information found on Internet social networks such as Facebook and MySpace<ref>cite news |last=Olmos |first=David |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aKbjO.Ew4S2E |title=Social Security Numbers Can Be Guessed From Data, Study Finds |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2009-07-06 |accessdate=2011-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617002156/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aKbjO.Ew4S2E |archivedate=2013-06-17 |df= </ref>
* Low security/privacy protection on photos that are easily clickable and downloaded on social networking sites.
* Befriending strangers on social networks and taking advantage of their trust until private information is given.

 Indicators that you may be a victim of identity theft 
The majority of identity theft victims do not realize that they are a victim until it has negatively impacted their lives. Many people do not find out that their identities have been stolen until they are contacted by financial institutions or discover suspicious activities on their bank accounts.<ref name=":0">Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/17/seven-signs-youre-a-victim-of-identity-theft.html|title=Seven signs you're a victim of identity theft|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|date=2014-01-18|website=CNBC|access-date=2016-11-12</ref>  According to an article by [https://twitter.com/theconsumerman?lang=en Herb Weisbaum], everyone in the US should assume that their personal information has been compromised at one point.<ref name=":0" /> It is therefore of great importance to watch out for warning signs that your identity has been compromised.

 Individual identity protection 
The acquisition of personal identifiers is made possible through serious breaches of privacy. For consumers, this is usually a result of them naively providing their personal information or login credentials to the identity thieves as a result of being duped but identity-related documents such as credit cards, bank statements, utility bills, checkbooks etc. may also be physically stolen from vehicles, homes, offices, and not the least letterboxes, or directly from victims by pickpockets and bag snatchers. Guardianship of personal identifiers by consumers is the most common intervention strategy recommended by the US Federal Trade Commission, PhoneBusters|Canadian Phone Busters and most sites that address identity theft. Such organizations offer recommendations on how individuals can prevent their information falling into the wrong hands.

Identity theft can be partially mitigated by ''not'' identifying oneself unnecessarily (a form of information security control known as risk avoidance). This implies that organizations, IT systems and procedures should not demand excessive amounts of personal information or credentials for identification and authentication. Requiring, storing and processing personal identifiers (such as Social Security number, national identification number, driver's license number, credit card number, etc.) increases the risks of identity theft unless this valuable personal information is adequately secured at all times.  Committing personal identifiers to memory is a sound practice that can reduce the risks of a would-be identity thief from obtaining these records.  To help in remembering numbers such as social security numbers and credit card numbers, it is helpful to consider using mnemonic techniques or memory aids such as the Mnemonic major system|mnemonic Major System.

Identity thieves sometimes impersonate dead people, using personal information obtained from death notices, gravestones and other sources to exploit delays between the death and the closure of the person's accounts, the inattentiveness of grieving families and weaknesses in the processes for credit-checking. Such crimes may continue for some time until the deceased's families or the authorities notice and react to anomalies.<ref>[http://www.idtheftcenter.org/Fact-Sheets/fs-117.html IDtheftcenter.org<!--Bot-generated title-->] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417074200/http://www.idtheftcenter.org/Fact-Sheets/fs-117.html|date=April 17, 2016, Identity Theft Resource Center Fact Sheet 117 Identity Theft and the Deceased - Prevention and Victim Tips.</ref>

In recent yearsWhen|date=September 2018, commercial identity theft protection/insurance services have become available in many countries. These services purport to help protect the individual from identity theft or help detect that identity theft has occurred in exchange for a monthly or annual membership fee or premium.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.nextadvisor.com/identity_theft_protection_services/compare.php |title=Identity Theft Protection Services  retrieved on 2008-12-16</ref> The services typically work either by setting fraud alerts on the individual's credit files with the three major credit bureaus or by setting up credit report monitoring with the credit bureaux. While identity theft protection/insurance services have been heavily marketed, their value has been called into question.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/145077/identitytheft_protection_what_services_can_you_trust.html |title=Identity-Theft Protection: What Services Can You Trust?

 Identity protection by organizations 
In their May 1998 testimony before the United States Senate, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) discussed the sale of Social Security numbers and other personal identifiers by credit-raters and data miners. The FTC agreed to the industry's self-regulating principles restricting access to information on credit reports.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/1998/05/identhef.htm |title=Testimony before the Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Information |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801/http://www.ftc.gov/os/1998/05/identhef.htm |archivedate=2012-08-01 |df= , Committee of the Judiciary, United States Senate May 20, 1998 pp 5,6</ref> According to the industry, the restrictions vary according to the category of customer. Credit reporting agencies gather and disclose personal and credit information to a wide business client base.

Poor stewardship of personal data by organizations, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data, can expose individuals to the risk of identity theft. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse have documented over 900 individual data breaches by US companies and government agencies since January 2005, which together have involved over 200 million total records containing sensitive personal information, many containing social security numbers.<ref>[http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/ChronDataBreaches.htm A Chronology of Data Breaches<!--Bot-generated title-->] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613183200/http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/ChronDataBreaches.htm|date=June 13, 2010</ref> Poor corporate diligence standards which can result in data breaches include:
* failure to shred confidential information before throwing it into dumpsters
* failure to ensure adequate network security
* credit card numbers stolen by call center agents and people with access to call recordings
* the theft of laptop computers or portable media being carried off-site containing vast amounts of personal information. The use of strong encryption on these devices can reduce the chance of data being misused should a criminal obtain them.
* the brokerage of personal information to other businesses without ensuring that the purchaser maintains adequate security controls
* Failure of governments, when registering sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations, to determine if the officers listed in the Articles of Incorporation are who they say they are. This potentially allows criminals access to personal information through credit rating and data mining services.

The failure of corporate or government organizations to protect consumer privacy, client confidentiality and political privacy has been criticized for facilitating the acquisition of personal identifiers by criminals.<ref>[http://www.siia.net/software/pubs/iit-00.pdf Internet Identity Theft - A Tragedy for Victims] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422192157/http://www.siia.net/software/pubs/iit-00.pdf |date=April 22, 2011 , Software and Information Industry Association.

Using various types of biometric information, such as fingerprints, for identification and authentication has been cited as a way to thwart identity thieves, however there are technological limitations and privacy concerns associated with these methods as well.

In March 2014, after it was learned two passengers with stolen passports were on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 which went missing on March 8, 2014, it came to light that Interpol maintains a database of 40 million lost and stolen travel documents from 157 countries which it makes available to governments and the public, including airlines and hotels. The Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTD) database however is little used. ''Big News Network'' which is based in the UAE, observed that Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble|Ronald K. Noble told a forum in Abu Dhabi the previous month this was the case. "The bad news is that, despite being incredibly cost effective and deployable to virtually anywhere in the world, only a handful of countries are systematically using SLTD to screen travelers. The result is a major gap in our global security apparatus that is left vulnerable to exploitation by criminals and terrorists," Noble is quoted as saying.<ref name="InterpolSLTD">cite news|title=Airlines and governments not checking stolen passports register|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/10686319/Interpol-warned-of-danger-posed-by-stolen-passports.html|accessdate=September 11, 2014|publisher=The Daily Telegraph</ref>

= Australia =
In Australia, each state has enacted laws that deal with different aspects of identity or fraud issues. Some states have now amended relevant criminal laws to reflect crimes of identity theft, such as the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA), Crimes Amendment (Fraud, Identity and Forgery Offences) Act 2009 and also in Queensland under the Criminal Code 1899 (QLD). Other states and territories are in states of development in respect of regulatory frameworks relating to identity theft such as Western Australia in respect of Criminal Code Amendment (Identity Crime) Bill 2009.

At the Commonwealth level, under the ''Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery & Related Offences) Act 2000'' which amended certain provisions within the ''Criminal Code Act 1995'',

Between 2014 and 2015, in Australia there were 133,921 fraud and deception offences, an increase of 6% from previous year.

Penalty: ''Imprisonment for 5 years''.

Likewise, each state has enacted their own privacy laws to prevent misuse of personal information and data. The Commonwealth ''Privacy Act'' is applicable only to Commonwealth and territory agencies, and to certain private sector bodies (where for example they deal with sensitive records, such as medical records, or they have more than $3 million turnover PA).

= Philippines =
Social networking sites are one of the most famous spreaders of ''posers'' in the online community, giving the users freedom to place any information they want without any verification that the account is being used by the real person.

Philippines, which ranks eighth in the numbers of users of Facebook and other social networking sites such as Twitter, Multiply (website)|Multiply and Tumblr, has been known as source of various identity theft problems.<ref>[https://www.techunblocked.org/2015/06/facebook-users-by-country-wise.html List Of Facebook Users By Country Wise Top Ranking 2016] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310213502/https://www.techunblocked.org/2015/06/facebook-users-by-country-wise.html |date=March 10, 2016 </ref>  Identities of those people who carelessly put personal information on their profiles can easily be stolen just by simple browsing.  There are people who meet online, get to know each other through the free Facebook chat and exchange of messages that then leads to sharing of private information.  Others get romantically involved with their online friends that they tend to give too much information such as their social security number, bank account and even personal basic information such as home address and company address.

This phenomenon lead to the creation of Senate Bill 52: Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2010.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/document/59428205/Senate-Bill-52-Cyber-Crime-Prevention-Act Full Text of Senate Bill 52 (Proposing the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2010)] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816172609/https://www.scribd.com/document/59428205/Senate-Bill-52-Cyber-Crime-Prevention-Act |date=August 16, 2016 </ref> Section 2 of this bill states that it recognizes the importance of communication and multimedia for the development, exploitation and dissemination of information but violators will be punished by the law through imprisonment or a fine upwards of Php200,000, but not exceeding 1 million, or depending on the damage caused, or both (Section 7).

= Sweden =
Sweden has had relatively few problems with identity theft. This is because only Swedish identity documents have been accepted for identity verification. Stolen documents are traceable by banks and some other institutions. The banks have the duty to check the identity of people withdrawing money or getting loans. If a bank gives money to someone using an identity document reported as stolen, the bank must take the loss. Since 2008, any EU passport is valid in Sweden for identity check, and Swedish passports are valid all over the EU. This makes it harder to detect stolen documents, but still banks in Sweden must ensure that stolen documents are not accepted.

Other types of identity theft have become more common in Sweden. One common example is ordering a credit card to someone who has an unlocked letterbox and is not home in the daytime. The thief steals the letter with the credit card and then the letter with the code which typically arrives a few days later. Usage of a stolen credit card is hard in Sweden, since an identity document or a PIN code it is normally demanded. If the shop does not demand that, it must take the loss from stolen credit cards. The method of observing someone using the credit card PIN code, stealing the card or skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming it, and then using the card, has become more common.

Legally, Sweden is an open society. Freedom of information legislation|The Principle of Public Access says that all information kept by public authorities must be available for anyone except in certain cases. Specifically, anyone's address, income, taxes etc. are available to anyone. This makes fraud easier (the address is restricted only for people who needs to hide).

There was until 2016 no legal ban specifically against using someone's identity, only on the indirect damage caused. To impersonate someone else for financial gain is a kind of fraud, which is described in the Criminal Code (lang-sv|brottsbalken). To impersonate someone else to discredit someone by breaking into social media accounts and provoke, is libel, but that is hard to sentence someone for. A new law was introduced late 2016 which partially banned unpermitted identity usage.<ref>[http://rkrattsdb.gov.se/SFSdoc/16/160485.PDF SFS 2016:485 Lag om ändring i brottsbalken]</ref>

= United Kingdom =
In the United Kingdom personal data is protected by the Data Protection Act 1998. The Act covers all personal data which an organization may hold, including names, birthday and anniversary dates, addresses, telephone numbers, etc.

Under English law (which extends to Wales but not to Northern Ireland or Scotland), the Deception (criminal law)|deception offences under the Theft Act 1968 increasingly contend with identity theft situations. In ''R v Seward'' (2005) EWCA Crim 1941<ref>cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2005/1941.html |title=R v Seward (2005) EWCA Crim 1941 </ref> the defendant was acting as the "front man" in the use of stolen credit cards and other documents to obtain goods. He obtained goods to the value of £10,000 for others who are unlikely ever to be identified. The Court of Appeal considered a sentencing policy for deception offenses involving "identity theft" and concluded that a prison sentence was required. Henriques J. said at para 14:"Identity fraud is a particularly pernicious and prevalent form of dishonesty calling for, in our judgment, deterrent sentences."

The statute now makes the possession of any "means of identification" to "knowingly transfer, possess, or use without lawful authority" a federal crime, alongside unlawful possession of identification documents. However, for federal jurisdiction to prosecute, the crime must include an "identification document" that either: (a) is purportedly issued by the United States, (b) is used or intended to defraud the United States, (c) is sent through the mail, or (d) is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce. ''See'' usc|18|1028(c). Punishment can be up to 5, 15, 20, or 30 years in federal prison, plus fines, depending on the underlying crime per usc|18|1028(b). In addition, punishments for the unlawful use of a "means of identification" were strengthened in § 1028A ("Aggravated Identity Theft"), allowing for a consecutive sentence under specific enumerated felony violations as defined in § 1028A(c)(1) through (11).<ref>Doyle, Charles.

As for the future of medical care and Medicaid, people are mostly concerned about cloud computing. The addition of using cloud information within United States medicare system would institute easily accessible health information for individuals, but that also makes it easier for identity theft.

Many states followed California's lead and enacted mandatory data breach notification laws. As a result, companies that report a data breach typically report it to all their customers.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.naag.org/states-offer-data-breach-protection.php |title=States Offer Data Breach Protection |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120913/http://www.naag.org/states-offer-data-breach-protection.php |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= </ref>

 Spread and impact 
Surveys in the USA from 2003 to 2006 showed a decrease in the total number of victims and a decrease in the total value of identity fraud from US$47.6 billion in 2003 to $15.6 billion in 2006. The average fraud per person decreased from $4,789 in 2003 to $1,882 in 2006. A Microsoft report shows that this drop is due to statistical problems with the methodology, that such survey-based estimates are "hopelessly flawed" and exaggerate the true losses by orders of magnitude.<ref>cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/149886/SexLiesandCybercrimeSurveys.pdf |title=Sex, Lies and Cybercrime Surveys |publisher=Microsoft |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2015-03-11</ref>

The 2003 survey from the Identity Theft Resource Center<ref>cite web |url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org |title=IDtheftcenter.org </ref> found that:

Ms. Brown testified that: "over a year and a half from January 1998 through July 1999, one individual impersonated me to procure over $50,000 in goods and services. Not only did she damage my credit, but she escalated her crimes to a level that I never truly expected: she engaged in drug trafficking. The crime resulted in my erroneous arrest record, a warrant out for my arrest, and eventually, a prison record when she was booked under my name as an inmate in the Chicago Federal Prison."
