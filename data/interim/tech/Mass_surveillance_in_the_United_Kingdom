The use of electronic surveillance by the United Kingdom grew from the development of signal intelligence and pioneering code breaking during World War II.<ref>cite news|title=How the British and Americans started listening in|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35491822|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=BBC|date=8 February 2016</ref> In the post-war period, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) was formed and participated in programmes such as the Five Eyes collaboration of English-speaking nations. This focused on intercepting electronic communications, with substantial increases in surveillance capabilities over time. A series of Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|media reports in 2013 revealed bulk collection and surveillance capabilities, including collection and sharing collaborations between GCHQ and the United States' National Security Agency. These were commonly described as mass surveillance.<ref>cite news|title=NSA leaks: US and Britain team up on mass surveillance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/22/nsa-leaks-britain-us-surveillance|accessdate=13 May 2015|work=The Guardian|date=22 June 2013</ref> Similar capabilities exist in other western European countries, such as France.<ref>cite news|title=France and the UK are on the edge of Kafkaesque surveillance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/28/surveillance-law-france-uk-kafka|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=The Guardian|date=28 July 2015</ref><ref>cite news|title=GCHQ and European spy agencies worked together on mass surveillance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/01/gchq-europe-spy-agencies-mass-surveillance-snowden|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=The Guardian|date=1 November 2013</ref>

Various government bodies maintain databases about citizens and residents of the United Kingdom. These include "bulk data sets" such as medical records.

 Legal framework for lawful interception 
further information|History of mass surveillance in the United Kingdom
The legal framework in the United Kingdom for lawful interception and storage of communications data and, when a warrant exists, the content of electronic communications is based on the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and several other pieces of legislation. The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (DRIPA) 2014 deals with the telecommunications data retention|retention of certain types of communications data (not the content of messages). It was brought into effect after the European Union's Data Retention Directive was declared invalid. The Telecommunications Act 1984 has also been used by the government to facilitate bulk communications data collection. The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 includes several provisions related to controlling or restricting the collection, storage, retention, and use of information in government databases. The Human Rights Act 1998 requires the intelligence agencies, including GCHQ, to respect citizens' rights as enumerated in the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled in December 2014 that the legal frameworks in the United Kingdom governing the bulk interception of data and intelligence sharing with agencies in other countries do not breach the European Convention on Human Rights, and are compliant with Articles 8 (right to privacy) and 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights.<ref name=refBBC141206 /><ref name=refGCHQ20141205 /><ref name=refIPTList /> However, the Tribunal stated that one particular aspect of intelligence sharing, the data-sharing arrangement that allowed UK Intelligence services to request data from the US surveillance programmes PRISM (surveillance program)|Prism and Upstream collection|Upstream, had been in contravention of human rights law until two paragraphs of additional information, providing details about the procedures and safeguards, were disclosed to the public in December 2014.<ref>cite web|title=IPT Ruling on Interception |url=http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-Ruling-on-Interception-Feb-2014.aspx |publisher=GCHQ |accessdate=6 February 2015 |date=6 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206205536/http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-Ruling-on-Interception-Feb-2014.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= </ref><ref name=BBC20150206>cite news|title=GCHQ censured over sharing of internet surveillance data with US|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31164451|accessdate=6 February 2015|publisher=BBC|date=6 February 2015</ref><ref name=refGuardian20150206>cite news|title=UK-US surveillance regime was unlawful 'for seven years'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/06/gchq-mass-internet-surveillance-unlawful-court-nsa|accessdate=6 February 2015|work=The Guardian|date=6 February 2015</ref>

 Investigatory Powers Act 2016 
Main article|Investigatory Powers Act 2016
As of|2015|11|4 the Investigatory Powers Bill was published for scrutiny. The bill would introduce new powers, as well as restate existing ones, for targeted surveillance|targeted interception of communications, bulk collection of communications data, and bulk interception of communications. New oversight procedures would be introduced, including a requirement for a judge to review a warrant signed by a Minister for interception of communications, that is reading the content of messages. The bill would require Internet connection records – which websites were visited but not the particular pages and not the full browsing history – to be kept by internet service providers for one year.

The Investigatory Powers Act 2016 is a comprehensive statute which makes provision for both targeted and bulk retention of content and metadata.  It consolidates much of the previous legislation and makes public a number of previously secret powers (equipment interference, bulk retention of metadata, intelligence agency use of bulk personal datasets).

Controversially, it enables the Government to require internet service providers and mobile phone companies to maintain records of (but not the content of) customers' Internet connections for up to 12 months.  Police and intelligence officers may seek approval for access to these records without a warrant, as part of a targeted investigation.<ref>cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/theresa-may-surveillance-measures-edward-snowden|title=Theresa May unveils surveillance measures in wake of Snowden claims|date=4 November 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 November 2015</ref>

In April 2014, the European Court of Justice ruled that the European Union's Data Retention Directive was invalid. Since October 2007, telecommunication companies had been required to keep records of phone calls and text messages for a minimum of 6 months and at most 24 months under this directive. The European Court of Justice found it violates two basic rights, respect for private life and protection of personal data.<ref>cite news|title=Top EU court rejects EU-wide data retention law|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26935096|accessdate=7 September 2014|publisher=BBC|date=8 April 2014</ref>

 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 
Main article |Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000

The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIP or RIPA) is significant piece of legislation that granted and regulated the powers of public bodies to carry out surveillance and investigation. Activities covered by the Act include the interception of the content of telephone, internet, and postal communications; collection of information about, but not the content of, telephone, Internet, and postal communications (type of communication, caller and called telephone numbers, Internet addresses, domain names, postal addresses, date, time, and duration); use of agents, informants, undercover officers; electronic surveillance of private buildings and vehicles; following people; and gaining access to encrypted data.<ref name=RIPA2000>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/introduction "Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000"], 2000 Chapter 23, UK Government Legislation. Retrieved 28 September 2013.</ref>

RIPA allows certain public bodies:<ref name=RIPA2000/>
* to demand that an ISP provide access to a customer's communications in secret;
* to engage in bulk collection of communications in transit;
* to demand ISPs fit equipment to facilitate surveillance;
* to Key disclosure law|demand that someone hand over encryption keys or passwords to protected information;
* to monitor people's Internet activities;
* to prevent the existence of interception warrants and any data collected from being revealed in court.

The powers granted by RIPA can be invoked by government officials on the grounds of national security, for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime or serious crime, preventing disorder, protecting public safety or health, in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, assessing or collecting any tax, duty, levy or other imposition, contribution or charge payable to a government department, or in an emergency, preventing or mitigating death, injury, or any damage to a person's physical or mental health. Some of the powers granted by the Act are available to a relatively short list of from 5 to 12 government bodies, while others are available to longer lists of over 40 bodies.<ref name=RIPA2000/>

The 2000 Act received Royal Assent on 28 July 2000 and Commencement Orders bringing provisions within this Act into force were issued between 2002 and 2012.

* The nine members of the committee are still nominated by the Prime Minister, but the House of Commons has the power veto the Prime Minister's suggestions. Previously, Parliament had no power to block such appointments.
* The panel now probes recent operations by the agencies. Before, its remit had only been for “resources, policy and administration” and it had seldom looked at specific operations.
* Officials acting for the committee are able to enter the premises of the intelligence agencies to inspect files and decide what the panel needs to see.
* Agencies are “required” to publish information unless handing over such details would compromise national security and they can obtain permission from the Prime Minister. Previously, the committee only had the power to “request” information.
* To signify the panel’s new status, its name was changed to the “Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament”.

In 2005 the City of Westminster trialled microphones fitted next to CCTV cameras. Westminster council explained that the microphones were part of an initiative to tackle urban noise and would not "be used to snoop", but comments from a council spokesman appeared to imply they could capture an audio stream alongside the video stream, rather than simply reporting noise levels.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4196075/Council-plans-to-listen-in-on-street-life.html "Council plans to listen in on street life"], David Derbyshire, ''The Telegraph'' (UK), 4 May 2005.

Anchor|CodeofPractice
In 2013, the Home Office published the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice for the use of surveillance cameras, including automatic number plate recognition systems, by local and government authorities. The aim of the code is to help ensure CCTV use is "characterised as surveillance by consent, and such consent on the part of the community must be informed consent and not assumed by a system operator. Surveillance by consent should be regarded as analogous to policing by consent."<ref>cite web|title=Surveillance Camera Code of Practice|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/204775/Surveillance_Camera_Code_of_Practice_WEB.pdf|publisher=UK Government Home Office|accessdate=1 December 2013|page=5|date=June 2013</ref>

= Number of cameras =
The vast majority of CCTV cameras are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses. According to 2011 Freedom of Information Act requests, the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around 52,000 over the entirety of the UK.<ref name=refBBW1>cite web|title=The Price of Privacy: How local authorities spent £515m on CCTV in four years|url=http://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/files/priceofprivacy/Price_of_privacy_2012.pdf|publisher=Big Brother Watch|accessdate=4 February 2015|date=February 2012|page=30</ref>

An article published in ''CCTV Image'' magazine estimated the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom was 1.85&nbsp;million in 2011. The estimate was based on extrapolating from a comprehensive survey of public and private cameras within the Cheshire Constabulary jurisdiction. This works out as an average of one camera for every 32 people in the UK, although the density of cameras varies greatly from place to place. The Cheshire report also claims that the average person on a typical day would be seen by 70 CCTV cameras.<ref name=Guardian2011/>

The Cheshire figure is regarded as more dependable than a previous study by Michael McCahill and Clive Norris of ''UrbanEye'' published in 2002.<ref name=Guardian2011>cite news|title=You're being watched: there's one CCTV camera for every 32 people in UK - Research shows 1.85m machines across Britain, most of them indoors and privately operated|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/02/cctv-cameras-watching-surveillance|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 2011|quote=Cheshire's deputy chief constable, Graeme Gerrard, said the data undermined more sensational estimates, such as the widely-repeated but dubious claim that the average Briton passes under 300 cameras a day.  Another questionable estimate that received widespread coverage – including in Home Office literature – was of 4.2m cameras in the UK. The methodology behind this claim was also dubious as it derived from a 2002 study that extrapolated from the number of cameras spotted on two streets in Wandsworth in London.|postscript=none; cite news|title=In the press: How the media is reporting the 1.85 million cameras story|url=http://www.securitynewsdesk.com/in-the-press-how-the-media-is-reporting-the-1-85-million-cameras-story/|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=Security News Desk|date=3 March 2011</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.urbaneye.net/results/ue_wp6.pdf|title=CCTV in London|accessdate=22 July 2009</ref> Based on a small sample in Putney High Street, McCahill and Norris extrapolated the number of surveillance cameras in London|Greater London to be around 500,000 and the total number of cameras in the UK to be around 4,200,000. According to their estimate the UK has one camera for every 14 people. Although it has been acknowledged for several years that the methodology behind this figure is flawed,<ref name=C42008>cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/factcheck+how+many+cctv+cameras/2291167|title=FactCheck: how many CCTV cameras?|publisher=Channel 4 News|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009</ref> it has been widely quoted. Furthermore, the figure of 500,000 for Greater London is often confused with the figure for the police and local government operated cameras in the City of London, which was about 650 in 2011.<ref name=refBBW1 />

The ''CCTV User Group'' estimated that there were around 1.5&nbsp;million private and local government CCTV cameras in city centres, stations, airports, and major retail areas in the UK.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.cctvusergroup.com/art.php?art=94|title=How many cameras are there?|publisher=CCTV User Group |date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009</ref> This figure does not include the smaller surveillance systems such as those that may be found in local corner shops and is therefore broadly in line with the Cheshire report.

Research conducted by the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research and based on a survey of all Scottish local authorities, identified that there were over 2,200 public space CCTV cameras in Scotland.<ref>Bannister, J., Mackenzie, S. and Norris, P.
