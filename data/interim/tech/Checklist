A checklist is a type of job aid used to reduce failure by compensating for potential limits of human memory and attention. It helps to ensure consistency and completeness in carrying out a task. A basic example is the "to do list". A more advanced checklist would be a schedule, which lays out tasks to be done according to time of day or other factors. A primary task in checklist is documentation of the task and auditing against the documentation.<ref>cite web|title= Introduction to Checklists|url=https://employeeonboardingchecklist.wordpress.com/|</ref>

Checklists have been used in healthcare practice to ensure that clinical practice guidelines are followed. An example is the Surgical Safety Checklist developed for the World Health Organization and found to have a large effect on improving patient safety<ref name="Checklists">cite journal |author1=Haynes A |author2=Gawande A |title=A surgical safety checklist to reduce morbidity and mortality in a global population |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=360 |issue=5 |pages=491–499 |date=January 2009  |pmid=19144931 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa0810119 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa0810119</ref> and subsequently found to have a nil effect in a cohort of hospitals in the Province of Ontario in Canada.<ref>cite journal |vauthors=Urbach DR, Govindarajan A, Saskin R, Wilton AS, Baxter NN |title=Introduction of surgical safety checklists in Ontario, Canada |journal=N.

Format
File:Closing a business checklist.svg|thumb|Example checklist
Checklists are often presented as lists with small checkboxes down the left hand side of the page. A small tick or checkmark is drawn in the box after the item has been completed.

Other formats are also sometimes used. Aviation checklists generally consist of a system and an action divided by a dashed line, and lack a checkbox as they are often read aloud and are usually intended to be reused.

Concern
Excessive dependence of checklists may hinder performance when dealing with a time-critical situation, for example a medical emergency or an in-flight emergency.  Checklists should not be used as a replacement for common sense.  Intensive training including rote-learning of checklists can help integrate use of checklists with more adaptive and flexible problem solving techniques.citation needed|date=March 2018
