The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is an anonymous network layer (implemented as a Mix network|Mix Network) that allows for Internet censorship circumvention|censorship-resistant, Peer-to-peer|peer to peer communication.  Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user's traffic (by using end-to-end encryption), and sending it through a volunteer-run network of roughly 55,000 computers distributed around the world.  Given the high number of possible paths the traffic can transit, a third party watching a full connection is unlikely.  The software that Implementation|implements this layer is called an "I2P Router (computing)|router", and a computer running I2P is called an "I2P Node (networking)|node".  I2P is Free software|free and Open-source software|open source, and is published under multiple software license|licenses.

 Technical design 
I2P is Development stage#Beta|beta software since 2003.<ref>Citation | url = https://geti2p.net/en/blog/ | type = blog | title = Get I2P.</ref>  The software's developers emphasize that there are likely to be Software bug|bugs in the beta version and that there has been insufficient peer review to date.<ref>cite web|title=Benefits of Tor over I2P| url= https://geti2p.net/en/comparison | publisher=I2P Dev Team | accessdate =23 December 2013</ref>  However, they believe the code is now reasonably stable and well-developed, and more exposure can help development of I2P.

The network itself is strictly message-based (like Internet Protocol|IP), but there is a Library (computing)|library available to allow reliable Streaming algorithm|streaming communication on top of it (similar to Transmission control protocol|TCP, although from version 0.6 there is a new User datagram protocol|UDP-based Synchronization in telecommunications#Synchronization Supply Unit|SSU transport).  All communication is end-to-end encryption|encrypted (in total there are four layers of encryption used when sending a message) through garlic routing,<ref>https://geti2p.net/en/docs/how/garlic-routing</ref> and even the Communication endpoint|end points ("destinations") are cryptographic identifiers (essentially a pair of public keys), so that neither sender nor recipient of a message need to reveal their IP address to the other side or to third-party observers.

Although many developers had been a part of the ''Invisible IRC Project (IIP)''<ref>Citation | title = Invisible IP | publisher = Source forge | contribution = IIP | contribution-url = http://invisibleip.sourceforge.net/iip/.</ref> and Freenet communities, there are significant differences between their designs and concepts.  IIP was an anonymous centralized Internet Relay Chat|IRC server.  Freenet is a censorship-resistant distributed data store.  I2P is an Anonymous P2P|anonymous peer-to-peer distributed communication layer designed to run ''any'' traditional internet service (e.g. Usenet, email, Internet Relay Chat|IRC, file sharing, Web hosting and HTTP, Telnet), as well as more traditional distributed applications (e.g. a distributed data store, a web proxy network using Squid (software)|Squid, or Domain Name System|DNS).

Many developers of I2P are known only under Pseudonymity|pseudonyms.  While the previous main developer, ''J. Random Hacker|jrandom'', is currently on hiatus,<ref>Cite web|url=https://geti2p.net/en/misc/jrandom-awol|title=Jrandom's Announcement - I2P|website=geti2p.net|language=en|access-date=2017-07-15</ref> others, such as ''zzz'', ''killyourtv'', and ''Complication'' have continued to lead development efforts, and are assisted by numerous contributors.<ref name="team"/>

I2P uses 2048bit ElGamal/AES256/SHA256+Session Tags encryption<ref>https://geti2p.net/pl/docs/how/elgamal-aes</ref> and Ed25519 EdDSA/ECDSA  Digital signature|signatures.<ref>https://trac.i2p2.de/wiki/Crypto/ECDSA</ref>

= Releases =

I2P has had a stable release every six to eight weeks.  Updates are distributed via I2P torrents and are signed by the release manager (generally ''zzz'' or ''str4d'').

 Software 
File:I2P_router_console_0.9.31-0.png|thumb|I2P 0.9.31-0 router console

Since I2P is an anonymous network layer, it is designed so other software can use it for anonymous communication. As such, there are a variety of tools currently available for I2P or in development.

The I2P Router (computing)|router is controlled through the router console, which is a web frontend accessed through a web browser.

= General networking =
* ''I2PTunnel'' is an application embedded into I2P that allows arbitrary TCP/IP applications to communicate over I2P by setting up "Tunneling protocol|tunnels" which can be accessed by connecting to pre-determined ports on localhost.
* ''SAM'' (''Simple Anonymous Messaging'') is a Communications protocol|protocol which allows a client application written in any programming language to communicate over I2P, by using a socket-based interface to the I2P router.<ref>Citation | title = API | contribution-url = https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/sam | contribution = SAM | publisher = I2P.</ref>
* ''BOB'' (''Basic Open Bridge'') is a less complex app to router protocol similar to "SAM"<ref>Citation | title = API | contribution-url = https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/bob | contribution = BOB | publisher = Get I2P.</ref><ref>Citation | url = http://bob.i2p.xyz/ | title = BOB: Basic Open Bridge API to the I2P router | type = official eepsite | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151204035029/http://bob.i2p.xyz/ | archivedate = 2015-12-04 | df =  .</ref>
* ''Orchid'' Outproxy Tor (anonymity network)|Tor plugin<ref>https://github.com/subgraph/Orchid</ref>

= Chat =
* Any IRC client made for the Internet Relay Chat can work, once connected to the I2P IRC server (on localhost).

= File sharing =
* Several programs provide BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent functionality for use within the I2P network.  Users cannot connect to non-I2P torrents or peers from within I2P, nor can they connect to I2P torrents or peers from outside I2P.<ref>Citation | place = Germany|DE | url = https://forum.i2p2.de/viewtopic.php?t=2068 | title = I2P Bittorrent FAQ | publisher = i2p2 | type = forum | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111103091108/http://forum.i2p2.de/viewtopic.php?t=2068 | archivedate = 2011-11-03 | df =  .</ref> ''I2PSnark'', included in the I2P install package, is a port of the BitTorrent client named Snark.<ref>Citation | url = http://klomp.org/snark/ | title = The Hunting of the Snark Project – BitTorrent Application Suite | publisher = Klomp.</ref> ''Vuze'', formerly known as Azureus, is a BitTorrent client that includes a plugin for I2P, allowing anonymous Segmented downloading|swarming through this network.<ref>Citation | contribution-url = http://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo | title = I2PHelper | contribution = How To for I2P Network Plugin | format = Howto | type = setup tutorial | publisher = Vuze.</ref> This plugin is still in an early stage of development, however it is already fairly stable. ''I2P-BT'' is a BitTorrent client for I2P that allows anonymous swarming for file sharing. This client is a modified version of the original BitTorrent 3.4.2 program which runs on Microsoft|MS Windows and most dialects of Unix in a GUI and command-line environment. It was developed by the individual known as 'duck' on I2P in cooperation with 'smeghead'. It is no longer being actively developed; however, there is a small effort to upgrade the I2P-BT client up to par with the BitTorrent 4.0 release. ''I2PRufus'' is an I2P port of the Rufus BitTorrent client.<ref>cite web | url = http://rufus.sourceforge.net/ | title = Rufus – BitTorrent Client |work= Sourceforge.</ref>  Robert (P2P Software) is the most actively maintained I2PRufus fork. XD is a standalone BitTorrent client written in Go.<ref>https://github.com/majestrate/XD/</ref>
*  Two Kad network clients exist for the I2P network, ''iMule'' and ''Nachtblitz''. iMule (''invisible Mule'') is a port of eMule for I2P network. iMule has not been developed since 2013. iMule is made for anonymous file sharing. In contrast to other eDonkey network|eDonkey clients, iMule only uses the Kademlia for proceeding to connect through I2P network, so no servers are needed. ''Nachtblitz''<ref>Citation | url = https://echelon.i2p.xyz/nachtblitz | title = Official Nachtblitz Resource | publisher = nachtblitz</ref> is a custom client built on the .NET Framework. The latest version is 1.4.27, released on March 23, 2016.<ref>http://echelon.i2p.xyz/nachtblitz/changelog.txt</ref> Nachtblitz includes a time lock to disable the software one year after its release date. 
* I2Phex is a port of the popular Gnutella client Phex to I2P. It is stable and fairly functional.
* A port of Tahoe-LAFS has been ported to I2P. This allows for files to be anonymously stored in Tahoe-LAFS grids.

 Bridging to Clearnet 
Currently, Vuze is the only torrent client that make clearnet (connections not through I2P) torrents available on I2P and vice versa, by using a plugin that connects them to the I2P network. Depending on the client settings, torrents from the internet can be made available on I2P (via announcements to I2P's DHT network) and torrents from I2P can be made available to the internet. For this reason, torrents previously published only on I2P can be made available to the entire Internet, and users of I2P can often download popular content from the Internet while maintaining the anonymity of I2P.<ref>cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/vuze-speeds-up-torrent-downloads-through-swarm-merging-150320/|title=Vuze Speeds Up Torrent Downloads Through "Swarm Merging" |date=20 March 2015 |work=TorrentFreak |accessdate=4 June 2016</ref><ref>cite web |url=https://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo#Network_Mixing |title=I2PHelper HowTo |work=VuzeWiki |accessdate=4 June 2016</ref>

As of | 2015, it is still considered beta version|beta software. I2P-Bote is accessible via the I2P web application|web console interface or using standard email protocols (i.e. IMAP/SMTP). All bote-mails are transparently end-to-end encrypted and signed by the sender's private key, thus removing the need for Pretty Good Privacy|PGP or other email encryption software. I2P-Bote offers additional anonymity by allowing for the use of mail relays with variable length delays. Since it is decentralized, there is no centralized email server that could correlate different email identities as communicating with each other (i.e. ''profiling''). Even the Node (networking)|nodes relaying the mails do not know the sender, and apart from sender and receiver, only the end of the high-Latency (engineering)|latency mail route and the storing nodes will know to whom (which I2P-Bote address – the user's IP address is still hidden by I2P) the mail is destined. The original sender could have gone offline long before the email becomes available to the recipient. No account registration is necessary, all you have to do in order to use it is create a new identity. I2P-Bote can be installed as an I2P plugin .<ref>Citation | title = Plugins | url = http://plugins.i2p.xyz/plugins/i2pbote/ | publisher = I2P | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20150909185051/http://plugins.i2p.xyz/plugins/i2pbote/ | archivedate = 2015-09-09 | df =  </ref>
* I2P also has a free pseudonymous e-mail service run by an individual called ''Postman''. Susimail is a web-based email client intended primarily for use with Postman's mail servers, and is designed with security and anonymity in mind. Susimail was created to address privacy concerns in using these servers directly using traditional email clients, such as leaking the user's hostname while communicating with the SMTP server. It is currently included in the default I2P distribution, and can be accessed through the I2P router console web interface. Mail.i2p can contact both I2P email users, via user@mail.i2p and public internet email users from a user@i2pmail.org address.
* Bitmessage#Bitmessage.ch|Bitmessage.ch can be used over I2P or Tor.

= Instant Messaging =
* ''I2P-Messenger'' is a simple Qt (framework)|Qt-based, serverless, end-to-end-encrypted instant messenger for I2P.<ref>Citation | title = Introducing I2P | url = https://geti2p.net/en/docs/how/tech-intro#app.i2pmessenger | date = Nov 10, 2015</ref> No servers can log the user's conversations. No ISP can log with whom the user chats, when, or for how long. As it is serverless, it can make use of I2P's end-to-end encryption, preventing any node between two parties from having access to the plain text. I2P-Messenger can be used for fully anonymous instant communication with persons the user doesn't even know, or, alternatively, to communicate securely and untraceably with friends, family members, or colleagues. <!--"Thus, it is also a useful tool against data retention in a surveillance society" Is this the part that is soapboxy?--> In addition to messaging, file transfer is also supported.
* ''I2P-Talk'' is another simple instant messenger incompatible with I2P-Messenger, but having the same security properties

= Publishing =
* ''Syndie'' is a content distribution application, suitable for blogs, newsgroups, Internet forum|forums and small media attachments. Syndie is designed for Resilience (network)|network resilience. It supports connections to I2P, the Tor network (Syndie does not support Socks proxies, workaround needed for Tor access), Freenet and the regular internet. Server connections are intermittent, and support Network performance#Examples of latency or throughput dominated systems|higher-latency communications. Connections can be made to any number of known servers. Content is spread efficiently using a Gossip protocol. 
* ''Aktie'' is an anonymous file sharing and distributed Web of trust forums system.  Aktie can connect to I2P with its internal router or use an external router. To fight spam, "hash payments" (proof of CPU work) is computed for every published item.

= Routers =
* I2PBerry is a Linux distribution which can be used as a router to encrypt and route network traffic through the I2P network.
*i2pd is a light-weight I2P router written in C++, stripping the excessive applications such as e-mail, torrents, and others that can be regarded as bloat.<ref>Cite web|url=https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/wiki/Differences-between-i2pd-and-Java-I2P-router|title=PurpleI2P/i2pd|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20</ref><ref>Cite web|url=https://i2pd.website/|title=Invisible Internet Protocol Daemon|website=i2pd.website|access-date=2018-08-20</ref>

; Eepsite: Eepsites are websites that are hosted anonymously within the I2P network.  Eepsite names end in ''.i2p'', such as ''ugha.i2p'' or ''forum.i2p''. EepProxy can locate these sites through the Key (cryptography)|cryptographic identifier keys stored in the hosts (file)|hosts.txt file found within the I2P program directory.  Typically, I2P is required to access these eepsites.<ref>cite web |url=https://geti2p.net/en/about/intro |title=Intro |work=I2P |accessdate=4 June 2016</ref>

; EepProxy: The EepProxy program handles all communication between the browser and any eepsite.  It functions as a proxy server that can be used by any web browser.
; Peers, I2P nodes: Other machines using I2P that are connected to user's machine within the network.  Each machine within the network shares the routing and forwarding of encrypted Network packet|packets.
; Tunnels: Every ten minutes, a connection is established between the user's machine and another peer.  Data to and from the user, along with the data for other peers (routed through the user's machine), pass through these tunnels and are forwarded to their final destination (may include more Jump Server|jumps).<ref>cite web |url=https://geti2p.net/en/docs/how/tunnel-routing |title=Tunnel Routing |work=I2P |accessdate=4 June 2016</ref>

From daterange|Format date|2015|08|15|Format date|2015|08|16 the first I2P convention was held in Toronto|Toronto, Ontario.<ref>cite web|url=https://geti2p.net/en/blog/post/2015/08/20/I2PCon_Mission_Accomplished |title=I2PCon: Mission Accomplished - Blog |work=I2P |accessdate=4 June 2016</ref>  The conference was hosted by a local hackerspace, Hacklab. The conference featured presentations from I2P developers and security researchers.

Format date|2015|08|15 mainly had presentations on the past growth of the I2P network, a talk on what happens when companies sell people's personal information, and a round-table discussion on general privacy and security topics.  The day ended with a CryptoParty, which helped to introduce new users to installing I2P, sending secure emails with I2P-Bote, and using I2P along with Vuze.

Format date|2015|08|16 had more technical discussions than the previous day.  The talks focused what how to dissuade bad-actors from using the network, how I2P has worked computer connection limits, how to do application development using I2P, and the development of the Android version.  This day ended with a development meeting.
