 Intel chips flaw investigation

Around 3 January 2018, ''The Register'' broke news about Google's long-ongoing investigation into Intel's processor design, which revealed that a serious flaw in the design of their chips would require Microsoft, Linux and Apple to update operating systems for computers around the world.<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42553818|title=Major flaw in millions of Intel chips|last=Wakefield|first=Jane|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=20 January 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706013820/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42553818|archive-date=6 July 2018|dead-url=no</ref>

Criticism 
On 7 October 2010, ''The Register'' ran an article headlined "Much of recent global warming actually caused by Sun". Martin Robbins, writing in ''The Guardian'', criticized ''The Register'' for failing to make it clear that the fluctuation is cyclical, and that the existence of fluctuations is not new information; the Sun's 11-year solar cycle regularly warms the Earth during one portion of the cycle, only to cool the Earth about equally during the opposite portion of the cycle. The reference journal article hypothesizes that the cycles are the reverse of what is usually assumed; contrary to ''The Register's'' implications, the journal's findings and comments do not conflict with the scientific consensus around anthropogenic global warming. Robbins also criticized ''The Register'' for the repeated use of the negative term 'boffin', "common at the random-USE-of-CAPITALS end of tabloid journalism". Lewis Page published a response in ''The Register'' defending his headline as technically correct, that "the article title accurately reflected her comments to Nature...[we] made clear in the body of the piece that the research referred only to the period 2004-2007. We also reported her comments on the solar cycle and possible effects over the past century" and finishing that "down here at the random-use-of-capitals end of tabloid journalism, Mr Robbins, we DON'T CARE what YOU THINK. We are certainly not going to amend the article because you say so: and this is our response, delivered pretty much the way your request for comment was"<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/oct/11/2|title=One climate paper, two conflicting headlines|last=Robbins|first=Martin|date=12 October 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=30 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231080259/https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/oct/11/2|archive-date=31 December 2016|dead-url=no</ref><ref>cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/12/graun_robbins_counterblast/ |title=Guardian super-blogger flames Reg boffinry desk |first=Lewis |last=Page |website=theregister.co.uk |date=12 October 2010 |accessdate=29 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810171743/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/12/graun_robbins_counterblast/ |archive-date=10 August 2017 |dead-url=no  </ref>
