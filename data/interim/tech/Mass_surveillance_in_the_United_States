NSA surveillance
Broader|Mass surveillanceThe practice of mass surveillance in the United States dates back to World War I Censorship in the United States#Wartime censorship|wartime monitoring and censorship of international communications from, to, or which passed through the United States. After the First World War and the Second World War, the surveillance continued, via programs such as the Black Chamber and Project SHAMROCK. The formation and growth of federal Law enforcement agency|law-enforcement and Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies such as the FBI, CIA, and NSA institutionalized surveillance used to also silence political dissent, as evidenced by COINTELPRO projects which targeted various organizations and individuals. During the Civil Rights Movement era, many individuals put under surveillance orders were first labelled as integrationists then deemed subversive. Other targeted individuals and groups included Native American activists, African American and Chicano liberation movement activists, and anti-war protesters.

The formation of the international UKUSA surveillance agreement of 1946 evolved into the ECHELON collaboration by 1955<ref>cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/history-of-5-eyes-explainer|title=History of 5-Eyes – explainer|first=Paul|last=Farrell|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=14 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com</ref> of five English-speaking nations, also known as the Five Eyes, and focused on interception of electronic communications, with substantial increases in domestic surveillance capabilities.<ref>cite web|url=https://giswatch.org/en/communications-surveillance/unmasking-five-eyes-global-surveillance-practices|title=Unmasking the Five Eyes' global surveillance practices - GISWatch|website=giswatch.org|accessdate=14 October 2017</ref>

Following the September 11th attacks of 2001, domestic and international mass surveillance capabilities escalated intensely. Contemporary mass surveillance relies upon annual presidential executive orders declaring a continued State of National Emergency, first signed by George W. Bush on September 14, 2001 and then continued on an annual basis by President Barack Obama,<ref>cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/all/obama-quietly-extends-post-911-state|title=Obama quietly extends post-9/11 state of national emergency|website=Msnbc.com|accessdate=14 October 2017</ref> and upon several subsequent national security Acts including the USA PATRIOT Act and FISA Amendment Act's PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM surveillance program. Critics and political dissenters currently describe the effects of these acts, orders, and resulting database network of Fusion centers as forming a veritable American police state that simply institutionalized the illegal COINTELPRO tactics used to assassinate dissenters and leaders from the 1950s onwards.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/lists/the-new-political-prisoners-leakers-hackers-and-activists-20130301|title=The New Political Prisoners: Leakers, Hackers and Activists|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=14 October 2017</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://sputniknews.com/us/20160706/1042493824/political-prisoners-suffer-in-america.html|title=US Political Prisoners: What Washington Doesn't Want You to Know|website=Sputniknews.com|accessdate=14 October 2017</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2014/2/25/exclusive_inside_the_army_spy_ring|title=Exclusive: Inside the Army Spy Ring & Attempted Entrapment of Peace Activists, Iraq Vets, Anarchists|website=Democracynow.org|accessdate=14 October 2017</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2012/12/27/the_fbi_vs_occupy_secret_docs|title=The FBI vs. Occupy: Secret Docs Reveal "Counterterrorism" Monitoring of OWS from Its Earliest Days|website=Democracynow.org|accessdate=14 October 2017</ref>

History and Overview
Mass surveillance in the United States can be traced back to the early 20th century, when all international mail sent through the U.S. Postal Service and international cables sent through companies such as Western Union, ITT Corporation|ITT, and RCA were sent under the surveillance authority of the Bureau of Investigation, later renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation,<ref>Curt Gentry, "J.Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets", NY; Norton and Co., 2001.</ref> and reviewed by the US military.<ref>James Bamford, The Shadow Factory, 2008, Doubleday, Chapter 'Shamrock', especially pg. 163</ref>

When the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI published stolen FBI documents revealing abuse of intelligence programs in 1971, Senator Frank Church began an investigation into the programs that become known as the Church Committee. The committee sought to investigate intelligence abuses throughout the 1970s.  Following a report provided by the committee outlining egregious abuse, in 1976 Congress established the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
Institutional domestic surveillance was founded in 1896 with the National Bureau of Criminal Identification, which evolved by 1908 into the Bureau of Investigation, operated under the authority of the Department of Justice. In 1935, the FBI had grown into an independent agency under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover whose staff, through the use of wire taps, cable taps, mail tampering, garbage filtering and infiltrators, prepared secret FBI Index Lists on more than 10 million people by 1939.<ref>Curt Gentry, "J.Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets". NY; Norton and Co., 2001.</ref>

Purported to be chasing 'communists' and other alleged subversives, the FBI used public and private pressure to destroy the lives of those it targeted during McCarthyism, including those lives of the Hollywood 10 with the Hollywood blacklist. The FBI's surveillance and investigation roles expanded in the 1950s while using the collected information to facilitate political assassinations, including the murders of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in 1969. The FBI is also directly connected to the bombings, assassinations, and deaths of other people including Malcolm X in 1963, Viola Liuzzo in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968, Anna Mae Pictou Aquash in 1976, and Judi Bari in 1990.citation needed|date=May 2018

 Church committee review 

1975: The Church Committee of the United States Senate was set up to investigate widespread intelligence abuses by the NSA, CIA and FBI.<ref name="reutershistory"/> Domestic surveillance, authorizied by the highest Executive (government)|executive branch of the federal government, spanned from the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration|FDR Administration to the Presidency of Richard Nixon. The following examples were reported by the Church Committee:

* Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt asked the FBI to put in its files the names of citizens sending telegrams to the White House opposing his "national defense" policy and supporting Col. Charles Lindbergh.<ref name="churchsenate"/>
* Harry S Truman|President Truman received inside information on a former Roosevelt aide's efforts to influence his appointments, labor union negotiating plans, and the publishing plans of journalists.<ref name="churchsenate"/>
* Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower received reports on purely political and social contacts with foreign officials by Bernard Baruch, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas.<ref name="churchsenate"/>
* The John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration ordered the FBI to wiretap a congressional staff member, three executive officials, a lobbyist, and a Washington law firm. US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy received data from a FBI wire tap on Martin Luther King, Jr. and an electronic listening device targeting a congressman, both of which yielded information of a political nature.<ref name="churchsenate"/>
* Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson asked the FBI to conduct "name checks" of his critics and members of the staff of his 1964 opponent, Senator Barry Goldwater.  He also requested purely political intelligence on his critics in the Senate, and received extensive intelligence reports on political activity at the 1964 Democratic Convention from FBI electronic surveillance.<ref name="churchsenate"/>
* Richard M. Nixon|President Nixon authorized a program of wiretaps which produced for the White House purely political or personal information unrelated to national security, including information about a List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court justice.<ref name="churchsenate"/>

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20130521200703/https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs94th/94755_II.pdf Final Report (Book II)] of the Church Committee revealed the following statistics:

* Over 26,000 individuals were at one point catalogued on an FBI list of persons to be rounded up in the event of a "National Emergencies Act|national emergency".<ref name="churchsenate"/>
* Over 500,000 domestic intelligence files were kept at the FBI headquarters, of which 65,000 of were opened in 1972 alone.<ref name="churchsenate"/>
* At least 130,000 First-class mail|first class letters were opened and photographed by the FBI from 1940 to 1966.<ref name="churchsenate"/>
* A quarter of a million first class letters were opened and photographed by the CIA from 1953 to 1973.<ref name="churchsenate"/>
* Millions of private telegrams sent from, to, or through the United States were obtained by the National Security Agency (NSA), under a secret arrangement with U.S. telegraph companies, from 1947 to 1975.<ref name="churchsenate"/>
* Over 100,000 Americans have been indexed in United States Army|U.S. Army intelligence files.<ref name="churchsenate"/>
* About 300,000 individuals were indexed in a CIA computer system during the course of Operation CHAOS.<ref name="churchsenate"/>

In response to the committee's findings, the United States Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978, which lead to the establishment of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which was authorised to issue surveillance Warrant (law)|warrants.<ref>cite web |date=10 June 2013 <!-- , 3:00 PM -->  |title=FISA Court Has Approved Majority of Surveillance Warrants |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/06/10/190453533/fisa-court-has-approved-majority-of-surveillance-warrants|website=Npr.org|accessdate=14 August 2013</ref>

Several decades later in 2013, the presiding judge of the FISA Court, Reggie Walton, told ''The Washington Post'' that the court only has a limited ability to supervise the government's surveillance, and is therefore "forced" to rely upon the accuracy of the information that is provided by federal agents.<ref>cite news |last=Leonnig |first=Carol D. |title=Court: Ability to police U.S. spying program limited|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/court-ability-to-police-us-spying-program-limited/2013/08/15/4a8c8c44-05cd-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=16 August 2013 |date=16 August 2013</ref>

On August 17, 1975 Senator Frank Church stated on NBC's "Meet the Press" without mentioning the name of the NSA about this agency:

quote|In the need to develop a capacity to know what potential enemies are doing, the United States government has perfected a technological capability that enables us to monitor the messages that go through the air. Now, that is necessary and important to the United States as we look abroad at enemies or potential enemies. We must know, at the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left such is the capability to monitor everything — telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter. There would be no place to hide.

If this government ever became a tyrant, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capability of this technology.

I don't want to see this country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.<ref>cite news|last=Popkey|first=Dan|title=Idaho's Frank Church has posthumous TV debate with Rick Santorum|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2013/08/05/2689931/idahos-frank-church-has-posthumous.html|accessdate=21 September 2013|newspaper=Idaho Statesman|date=5 August 2013</ref><ref>cite web|title=Sen.

In the aftermath of the September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, bulk domestic spying in the United States increased dramatically. The desire to prevent future attacks of this scale led to the passage of the Patriot Act.

In 2005, a report about President Bush's President's Surveillance Program appeared in the ''New York Times''.

<blockquote>... it means that the government has detailed records of calls they made — across town or across the country — to family members, co-workers, business contacts and others.

The report failed to generate discussion of privacy rights in the media and was not referenced by Greenwald or the ''Washington Post'' in any of their subsequent reporting.

In 2009, ''The New York Times'' cited several anonymous intelligence officials alleging that "the N.S.A. made Americans targets in eavesdropping operations based on insufficient evidence tying them to terrorism" and "the N.S.A. tried to wiretap a member of Congress without a warrant".<ref name="nytimes2">cite news|title=Officials Say U.S. Wiretaps Exceeded Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/us/16nsa.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=16 August 2013|first1=Eric|last1=Lichtblau|first2=James|last2=Risen|date=16 April 2009</ref>

quote|Under construction by contractors with top-secret clearances, the blandly named Utah Data Center is being built for the National Security Agency. A project of immense secrecy, it is the final piece in a complex puzzle assembled over the past decade. Its purpose: to intercept, decipher, analyze, and store vast swaths of the world's communications as they zap down from satellites and zip through the underground and undersea cables of international, foreign, and domestic networks. The heavily fortified $2 billion center should be up and running in September 2013. Flowing through its servers and routers and stored in near-bottomless databases will be all forms of communication, including the complete contents of private emails, cell phone calls, and Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails—parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases, and other digital "pocket litter." It is, in some measure, the realization of the "Information Awareness Office|total information awareness" program created during the first term of the Presidency of George W.

The mammoth Bluffdale, Utah|Bluffdale center will have another important and far more secret role that until now has gone unrevealed. It is also critical, he says, for breaking codes.

<blockquote>Given the limited record before me at this point in the litigation – most notably, the utter lack of evidence that a terrorist attack has ever been prevented because searching the NSA database was faster than other investigative tactics – I have serious doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time-sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism.<ref name="Guardian20131216" /></blockquote>

"Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of showing that their privacy interests outweigh the government's interest in collecting and analysing bulk telephony metadata and therefore the NSA's bulk collection program is indeed an unreasonable search under the fourth amendment," he wrote.<ref name="Guardian20131216" />

"The Fourth Amendment typically requires 'a neutral and detached authority be interposed between the police and the public,' and it is offended by 'general warrants' and laws that allow searches to be conducted 'indiscriminately and without regard to their connections with a crime under investigation,'" he wrote.<ref name="FoxNews20131217" /> He added:

<blockquote>I cannot imagine a more 'indiscriminate' and 'arbitrary invasion' than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval. Surely such a program infringes on 'that degree of privacy' that the founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment. Indeed I have little doubt that the author of our Constitution, James Madison, who cautioned us to beware 'the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power,' would be aghast.<ref name="FoxNews20131217">cite news|title=Judge deals blow to NSA phone data program|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/17/judge-deals-nsa-defeat-on-bulk-phone-collection/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=18 December 2013|date=17 December 2013|author=Jake Gibson</ref></blockquote>

H.R.4681 – Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015
On 20 May 2014, U.S. House of Representatives|U.S. Representative for ushr|MI|8 Republican congressman Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers introduced Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 with the goal of authorizing appropriations for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 for intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the United States Government, the Community Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes.

Some of its measures cover the limitation on retention.--A covered communication (meaning any nonpublic telephone or electronic communication acquired without the consent of a person who is a party to the communication, including communications in electronic storage) shall not be retained in excess of 5 years, unless:(i) the communication has been affirmatively determined, in whole or in part, to constitute foreign intelligence or counterintelligence or is necessary to understand or assess foreign intelligence or counterintelligence;  (ii) the communication is reasonably believed to constitute evidence of a crime and is retained by a law enforcement agency;  (iii) the communication is enciphered or reasonably believed to have a secret meaning;   (iv) all parties to the communication are reasonably believed to be non-United States persons;  (v) retention is necessary to protect against an imminent threat to human life, in which case both the nature of the threat and the information to be retained shall be reported to the congressional intelligence committees not later than 30 days after the date such retention is extended under this clause;  (vi) retention is necessary for technical assurance or compliance purposes, including a court order or discovery obligation, in which case access to information retained for technical assurance or compliance purposes shall be reported to the congressional intelligence committees on an annual basis; or  (vi) retention is necessary for technical assurance or compliance purposes, including a court order or discovery obligation, in which case access to information retained for technical assurance or compliance purposes shall be reported to the congressional intelligence committees on an annual basis; or (vii) retention for a period in excess of 5 years is approved by the head of the element of the intelligence community responsible for such retention, based on a determination that retention is necessary to protect the national security of the United States, in which case the head of such element shall provide to the congressional intelligence committees a written certification describing--  (I) the reasons extended retention is necessary to 
protect the national security of the United States;  (II) the duration for which the head of the element is authorizing retention;  (III) the particular information to be retained; and  (IV) the measures the element of the intelligence community is taking to protect the privacy interests of United States persons or persons located inside the United States.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4681|title=H.R.4681 - Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=14 October 2017</ref>

On 10 December 2014, Republican Party (United States)|Republican United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative for ushr|MI|3 member of United States Congress|Congress Justin Amash criticized the act on his Facebook as being "one of the most egregious sections of law I've encountered during my time as a representative" and "It grants the executive branch virtually unlimited access to the communications of every American".<ref>cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/repjustinamash?hc_location=timeline|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=14 October 2017</ref>

On 11 December 2014, a petition was created on We the People (petitioning system)|We the People section of the whitehouse.gov website petitioning the Obama administration to veto the law.

USA Freedom Act
The USA Freedom Act was signed into law on June 2, 2015, the day after certain provisions of the Patriot Act had expired.  It mandated an end to bulk collection of phone call metadata by the NSA within 180 days, but allowed continued mandatory retention of metadata by phone companies with access by the government with case-by-case approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/11/29/457779757/nsa-ends-sept-11th-era-surveillance-program|title=NSA Ends Sept. 11-Era Surveillance Program|website=Npr.org|accessdate=14 October 2017</ref>

=Logging postal mail=
Main |Mail Isolation Control and Tracking
Under the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking program, the U.S. Postal Service photographs the exterior of every piece of paper mail that is processed in the United States — about 160 billion pieces in 2012. The U.S. Postmaster General stated that the system is primarily used for mail sorting, but the images are available for possible use by law enforcement agencies.<ref name=APInterview-August2013/> Created in 2001 following the anthrax attacks that killed five people, it is a sweeping expansion of a 100-year-old program called "mail cover" which targets people suspected of crimes. Together, the two programs show that postal mail is subject to the same kind of scrutiny that the National Security Agency gives to telephone calls, e-mail, and other forms of electronic communication.<ref name=USMailLogging-NYT-July2013>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/us/monitoring-of-snail-mail.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 "U.S. Postal Service Logging All Mail for Law Enforcement"], Ron Nixon, ''New York Times'', July 3, 2013. Retrieved 25 September 2013.</ref>

Mail cover surveillance requests are granted for about 30 days, and can be extended for up to 120 days. Images captured under the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking program are retained for a week to 30 days and then destroyed.<ref name=APInterview-August2013>[http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-interview-usps-takes-photos-all-mail "AP Interview: USPS takes photos of all mail"], Associated Press (AP), 2 August 2013.</ref> There are two kinds of mail covers: those related to criminal activity and those requested to protect national security. Criminal activity requests average 15,000 to 20,000 per year, while the number of requests for national security mail covers has not been made public. Neither the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking program nor the mail cover program require prior approval by a judge. For both programs the information gathered is metadata from the outside of the envelope or package for which courts have said there is no expectation of privacy. Opening the mail to view its contents would require a Warrant (law)|warrant approved by a judge.<ref name=USMailLogging-NYT-July2013/>

=Wiretapping=
Billions of dollars per year are spent, by agencies such as the Information Awareness Office, National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems such as Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore, Echelon (signals intelligence)|ECHELON, and NarusInsight to intercept and analyze the immense amount of data that traverses the Internet and telephone system every day.<ref name="zdnet-fbi">cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/fbi-turns-to-broad-new-wiretap-method/151059  |title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method |last=McCullagh |first=Declan |date=30 January 2007 |work=ZDNet News|accessdate=2009-03-13</ref>

The Total Information Awareness program, of the Information Awareness Office, was formed in 2002 by the Pentagon and led by former rear admiral John Poindexter.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/the-agency-that-could-be-big-brother.html|title=The Agency That Could Be Big Brother|first=James|last=Bamford|date=25 December 2005|website=Nytimes.com</ref> The program designed numerous technologies to be used to perform mass surveillance. Examples include advanced speech-to-text programs (so that phone conversations can be monitored en-masse by a computer, instead of requiring human operators to listen to them), social network analysis software to monitor groups of people and their interactions with each other, and "Human identification at a distance" software which allows computers to identify people on surveillance cameras by their facial features and gait (the way they walk). The program was later renamed "Terrorism Information Awareness", after a negative public reaction.

Legal foundations
The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), passed in 1994, requires that all U.S. telecommunications companies modify their equipment to allow easy Telephone tapping|wiretapping of telephone, VoIP, and broadband internet traffic.<ref name="eff-calea-archive">cite web |url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html |title=CALEA Archive |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |accessdate=14 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503035053/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html |archivedate=3 May 2009 |df= </ref><ref name="eff-calea-summary">cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/issues/calea|title=CALEA: The Perils of Wiretapping the Internet |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |accessdate=14 March 2009</ref><ref name="eff-calea-faq">cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq|title=FAQ on the CALEA Expansion by the FCC |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |accessdate=14 March 2009</ref>

In 1999 two models of Telecommunications data retention|mandatory data retention were suggested for the US. The first model would record the IP address assigned to a customer at a specific time. In the second model, "which is closer to what Europe adopted", telephone numbers dialed, contents of Web pages visited, and recipients of e-mail messages must be retained by the ISP for an unspecified amount of time.<ref>cite news |title=ISP snooping gaining support |url=http://news.cnet.com/ISP-snooping-gaining-support/2100-1028_3-6061187.html |author=Declan McCullagh |work=CNET |publisher=CBS Interactive |date=14 April 2006 |accessdate=17 March 2009 </ref><ref>cite news |title=FBI, politicos renew push for ISP data retention laws |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9926803-38.html |quote=Based on the statements at Wednesday's hearing and previous calls for new laws in this area, the scope of a mandatory data retention law remains fuzzy.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has an ongoing lawsuit (Hepting v. AT&T) against the telecom giant AT&T Inc. for its assistance to the U.S. government in monitoring the communications of millions of American citizens.

It allows bi-directional exploitation of Denied networks using standard on-net tools.  The one limitation of RADON is that it is a USB device that requires a physical connection to a laptop or PC to work. RADON was created by a Massachusetts firm called Netragard. Their founder, Adriel Desautels, said about RADON, "it is our 'safe' malware. RADON is designed to enable us to infect customer systems in a safe and controllable manner. Safe means that every strand is built with an expiration date that, when reached, results in RADON performing an automatic and clean self-removal." citation needed|date=June 2016

Intelligence apparatus to monitor Americans
Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, a vast domestic intelligence apparatus has been built to collect information using FBI, local police, state homeland security offices and military criminal investigators. The intelligence apparatus collects, analyzes and stores information about millions of (if not all) American citizens, most of whom have not been accused of any wrongdoing. Every state and local law enforcement agency is to feed information to federal authorities to support the work of the FBI.<ref>cite news |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/monitoring-america/ |work=Top Secret America, A Washington Post Investigation |title=Monitoring America |author1=Data Priest  |author2=William M.

The PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM special source operation system was enabled by the Protect America Act of 2007 under President Bush and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which legally immunized private companies that cooperated voluntarily with US intelligence collection and was renewed by Congress under President Obama in 2012 for five years until December 2017. According to ''The Register'', the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 "specifically authorizes intelligence agencies to monitor the phone, email, and other communications of U.S. citizens for up to a week without obtaining a warrant" citation needed|date=June 2016 when one of the parties is outside the U.S.

PRISM was first publicly revealed on 6 June 2013, after classified documents about the program were leaked to ''The Washington Post'' and ''The Guardian'' by Edward Snowden.

Telephones
In early 2006, ''USA Today'' reported that several major telephone companies were cooperating illegally with the National Security Agency to monitor the phone records of U.S. citizens, and storing them in a large database known as the NSA call database. This report came on the heels of allegations that the Federal government of the United States|U.S. government had been conducting electronic surveillance of domestic telephone calls without warrants.<ref>cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm |title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls |work=USA Today |first=Leslie |last=Cauley |date=11 May 2006 |accessdate=12 May 2010</ref>

Infiltration of smartphones
As worldwide sales of smartphones began exceeding those of feature phones, the NSA decided to take advantage of the smartphone boom. This is particularly advantageous because the smartphone combines a myriad of data that would interest an intelligence agency, such as social contacts, user behavior, interests, location, photos and credit card numbers and passwords.<ref name="spiegel201399"/>
