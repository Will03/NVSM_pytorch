Use dmy dates|date=July 2013Internet censorship circumvention is the use of various methods and tools to bypass internet censorship.

Various techniques and methods are used to bypass Internet censorship, and have differing ease of use, speed, security, and risks. Some methods, such the use of alternate Domain Name System|DNS servers, evade blocking by using an alternate address or address lookup system to access the site.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":03" /> Techniques using Website mirroring|website mirrors or Archive site|archive sites rely on other copies of the site being available at different locations.<ref name="CitizensLab-2007" /> Additionally, there are solutions that rely on gaining access to an Internet connection that is not subject to filtering, often in a different jurisdiction not subject to the same censorship laws, using technologies such as Proxy server|proxying, Virtual private network|Virtual Private Networks, or anonymization networks.<ref>[http://www.internetfreedom.org/files/WhitePaper/TechnologiesBattleAndDefeatInternetCensorship70920.pdf ''New Technologies Battle and Defeat Internet Censorship''], Global Internet Freedom Consortium, 20 September 2007</ref>

An arms race has developed between censors and developers of circumvention software, resulting in more sophisticated blocking techniques by censors and the development of harder-to-detect tools by researchers.<ref name=":4" /> Estimates of adoption of circumvention tools vary substantially and are disputed.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":7">Cite web|url=https://blog.globalwebindex.com/chart-of-the-day/china-the-home-to-facebook-and-twitter/|title=China: The Home to Facebook and Twitter?|date=2012-09-27|website=GlobalWebIndex Blog|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-12-13</ref><ref name=":0">Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2012/09/26/surprise-twitters-active-country-china-where-blocked/|title=Report: Twitter's Most Active Country Is China (Where It Is Blocked)|last=Ong|first=Josh|date=2012-09-26|website=The Next Web|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-11</ref><ref name="Guardian 5 December 2014" /> Barriers to adoption can include usability issues,<ref>Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Linda|last2=Fifield|first2=David|last3=Malkin|first3=Nathan|last4=Iyer|first4=Ganesh|last5=Egelman|first5=Serge|last6=Wagner|first6=David|date=2017-07-01|title=A Usability Evaluation of Tor Launcher|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/popets-2017-0030|journal=Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies|volume=2017|issue=3|pages=90–109|doi=10.1515/popets-2017-0030|issn=2299-0984</ref> difficulty finding reliable and trustworthy information about circumvention,<ref name=":6" /> lack of desire to access censored content,<ref name="UNESCO-2011">[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/freedom-of-connection-freedom-of-expression-the-changing-legal-and-regulatory-ecology-shaping-the-internet/ ''Freedom of connection, freedom of expression: the changing legal and regulatory ecology shaping the Internet''], Dutton, William H.; Dopatka, Anna; Law, Ginette; Nash, Victoria, Division for Freedom of Expression, Democracy and Peace, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris, 2011, 103 pp., ISBN|978-92-3-104188-4</ref> and risks from breaking the law.<ref name="CitizensLab-2007" />

Circumvention methods
There are many methods available that may allow the circumvention of Internet filtering, which can widely vary in terms of implementation difficulty, effectiveness, and resistance to detection.

= Alternate names and addresses =
Filters may block specific domain names, either using DNS hijacking or URL filtering. Sites are sometimes accessible through alternate names and addresses that may not be blocked.<ref name=":5">Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/inline_images/Censorship.pdf|title=Leaping Over the Firewall: A Review of Censorship Circumvention Tools|last=Callanan|first=Cormac|last2=Dries-Ziekenheiner|first2=Hein|date=2011-04-11|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-11|last3=Escudero-Pascual|first3=Alberto|last4=Guerra|first4=Robert</ref>

Some websites may offer the same content at multiple pages or domain names.<ref name=":03">Cite news|url=https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-circumvent-online-censorship|title=How to: Circumvent Online Censorship|date=2014-08-05|work=Surveillance Self-Defense|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en</ref> For example, the English Wikipedia is available at https://en.wikipedia.org/, and there is also a mobile-formatted version at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/.

If DNS resolution is disrupted but the site is not blocked in other ways, it may be possible to access a site directly through its IP address. Using alternative DNS servers, or public recursive name servers may bypass DNS-based blocking.<ref name=":5" />

Censors may block specific IP addresses. Depending on how the filtering is implemented, it may be possible to use different forms of the IP address, such as by specifing the address in a different base.<ref>[http://www.notascoolasitseems.com/review/circumventing-network-filters-or-internet-censorship-using-simple-methods-vpns-and-proxies "Circumventing Network Filters Or Internet Censorship Using Simple Methods, VPNs, And Proxies"] Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114152734/http://www.notascoolasitseems.com/review/circumventing-network-filters-or-internet-censorship-using-simple-methods-vpns-and-proxies#|date=14 November 2011, Not As Cool As It Seems, 16 December 2009, accessed 16 September 2011</ref> For example, the following URLs all access the same site, although not all browsers will recognize all forms: [http://208.80.152.2/ http://208.80.152.2] (dotted decimal), [http://208.80.152.2/ http://3494942722] (decimal), [http://208.80.152.2/ http://0320.0120.0230.02] (dotted octal), [http://208.80.152.2/ http://0xd0509802] (hexadecimal), and [http://208.80.152.2/ http://0xd0.0x50.0x98.0x2] (dotted hexadecimal).

= Mirrors, caches, and copies =
Cached pages: Some search engines keep copies of previously indexed webpages, or Web cache|cached pages, which are often hosted by search engines and may not be blocked.<ref name="CitizensLab-2007" /> For example, Google allows the retrieval of cached pages by entering "cache:''some-url''" as a search request.<ref>Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1687222?hl=en|title=View web pages cached in Google Search Results - Google Search Help|website=support.google.com|access-date=2018-12-11</ref>

Mirror and archive sites: Copies of web sites or pages may be available at Website mirror|mirror or Archive site|archive sites such as the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.

RSS aggregators: RSS aggregators such as Feedly may be able to receive and pass on RSS feeds that are blocked when accessed directly.<ref name="CitizensLab-2007">[http://www.nartv.org/mirror/circ_guide.pdf ''Everyone's Guide to By-passing Internet Censorship''], The Citizen Lab, University of Toronto, September 2007</ref>

=Proxying=
Web proxies: Proxy websites are configured to allow users to load external web pages through the proxy server, permitting the user to load the page as if it is coming from the proxy server and not the (blocked) source.<ref name="CitizensLab-2007" /> However, depending on how the proxy is configured, a censor may be able to determine the pages loaded and/or determine that the user is using a proxy server.<ref name=":03" />

For example, the mobile Opera Mini browser uses a proxy-based approach employing encryption and compression in order to speed up downloads. This has the side effect of allowing it to circumvent several approaches to Internet censorship. In 2009 this led the government of China to ban all but a special Chinese versions of the browser.<ref>cite web|title=Opera accused of censorship, betrayal by Chinese users|work=CNet Asia|author=Steven Millward|date=22 November 2009|url=http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/opera-accused-of-censorship-betrayal-by-chinese-users-62115913.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103151615/http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/opera-accused-of-censorship-betrayal-by-chinese-users-62115913.htm|archivedate=3 November 2013|df=dmy-all</ref>

Domain fronting: Circumvention software can implement a technique called domain fronting, where the destination of a connection is hidden by passing the initial requests through a content delivery network or other popular site.<ref>Cite journal|last=Fifield|first=David|last2=Lan|first2=Chang|last3=Hynes|first3=Rod|last4=Wegmann|first4=Percy|last5=Paxson|first5=Vern|date=2015-06-01|title=Blocking-resistant communication through domain fronting|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/popets/2015/2/article-p46.xml|journal=Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies|language=en|volume=2015|issue=2|pages=46–64|doi=10.1515/popets-2015-0009|issn=2299-0984</ref> This technique was used by messaging applications including Signal and Telegram, but large cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform|Google Cloud no longer permit its use.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-05-03/telegram-block-gets-help-from-google-and-amazon|title=Russian Censor Gets Help From Amazon and Google|last=Bershidsky|first=Leonid|date=3 May 2018|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 November 2018</ref>

SSH tunneling: By establishing an Tunneling protocol|SSH tunnel, a user can forward all their traffic over an encrypted channel, so both outgoing requests for blocked sites and the response from those sites are hidden from the censors, for whom it appears as unreadable Secure Shell|SSH traffic.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/168145/how-to-use-ssh-tunneling/|title=How to Use SSH Tunneling to Access Restricted Servers and Browse Securely|last=Hoffman|first=Chris|website=How-To Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-11</ref>

Virtual private network (VPN): Using a Virtual private network|VPN, A user who experiences internet censorship can create a secure connection to a more permissive country, and browse the internet as if they were situated in that country.<ref name=":5" /> Some services are offered for a monthly fee; others are ad-supported. According to GlobalWebIndex, over 400 million people use virtual private networks to circumvent censorship or for increased level of privacy.<ref name="Guardian 5 December 2014" />

Tor: More advanced tools such as Tor (anonymity network)|Tor route encrypted traffic through multiple servers to make the source and destination of traffic less traceable. It can in some cases be used to avoid censorship, especially when configured to use traffic obfuscation techniques.<ref name=":4">Cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Lucas|last2=Ristenpart|first2=Thomas|last3=Shrimpton|first3=Thomas|date=14 December 2016|title=Network Traffic Obfuscation and Automated Internet Censorship|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7782699/|journal=IEEE Security & Privacy|language=en-US|volume=14|issue=6|pages=43–53|doi=10.1109/msp.2016.121|issn=1540-7993|via=</ref>

= Traffic obfuscation =
A censor may be able to detect and block use of circumvention tools. There are efforts to make circumvention tools less detectable by randomizing the traffic, attempting to mimic a non-blocked protocol, or tunneling traffic through a whitelisted service by using techniques including domain fronting.<ref name=":4" /> Tor and other circumvention tools have adopted multiple obfuscation techniques that users can use depending on the nature of their connection, which are sometimes called "Pluggable Transports."<ref>Cite journal|last=Shahbar|first=K.|last2=Zincir-Heywood|first2=A.

After a April 2018 ban on the Telegram (service)|Telegram messaging app in Iran, web searches for VPN and other circumvention software increased as much as 48x for some search terms, but there was evidence that users were downloading unsafe software.

Anonymity, risks, and trust

Circumvention and anonymity are different. Circumvention systems are designed to bypass blocking, but they do not usually protect identities. Anonymous systems protect a user's identity. And while they can contribute to circumvention, that is not their primary function. It is important to understand that open public proxy sites do not provide anonymity and can view and record the location of computers making requests as well as the websites accessed.<ref name="CitizensLab-2007" />

In many jurisdictions accessing blocked content is a serious crime, particularly content that is considered child pornography, a threat to national security, or an incitement of violence. Thus it is important to understand the circumvention technologies and the protections they do or do not provide and to use only tools that are appropriate in a particular context. Great care must be taken to install, configure, and use circumvention tools properly. Individuals associated with high-profile rights organizations, dissident, protest, or reform groups should take extra precautions to protect their online identities.<ref name="CitizensLab-2007" />

Circumvention sites and tools should be provided and operated by trusted third parties located outside the censoring jurisdiction that do not collect identities and other personal information. Best are trusted family and friends personally known to the circumventor, but when family and friends are not available, sites and tools provided by individuals or organizations that are only known by their reputations or through the recommendations and endorsement of others may need to be used. Commercial circumvention services may provide anonymity while surfing the Internet, but could be compelled by law to make their records and users' personal information available to law enforcement.<ref name="CitizensLab-2007" />

Software

There are five general types of Internet censorship circumvention software:

CGI proxies use a script running on a web server to perform the proxying function. A Common Gateway Interface|CGI proxy client sends the requested url embedded within the data portion of an HTTP request to the CGI proxy server. The CGI proxy server pulls the ultimate destination information from the data embedded in the HTTP request, sends out its own HTTP request to the ultimate destination, and then returns the result to the proxy client. A CGI proxy tool's security can be trusted as far as the operator of the proxy server can be trusted. CGI proxy tools require no manual configuration of the browser or client software installation, but they do require that the user use an alternative, potentially confusing browser interface within the existing browser.

HTTP proxies send Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP requests through an intermediate proxying server. A client connecting through an HTTP proxy sends exactly the same HTTP request to the proxy as it would send to the destination server unproxied. The HTTP proxy parses the HTTP request; sends its own HTTP request to the ultimate destination server; and then returns the response back to the proxy client. An HTTP proxy tool's security can be trusted as far as the operator of the proxy server can be trusted. HTTP proxy tools require either manual configuration of the browser or client side software that can configure the browser for the user. Once configured, an HTTP proxy tool allows the user transparently to use his normal browser interface.

Application proxies are similar to HTTP proxies, but support a wider range of online applications.

Peer-to-peer systems store content across a range of participating volunteer servers combined with technical techniques such as re-routing to reduce the amount of trust placed on volunteer servers or on social networks to establish trust relationships between server and client users. Peer-to-peer system can be trusted as far as the operators of the various servers can be trusted or to the extent that the architecture of the peer-to-peer system limits the amount of information available to any single server and the server operators can be trusted not to cooperate to combine the information they hold.

Re-routing systems send requests and responses through a series of proxying servers, encrypting the data again at each proxy, so that a given proxy knows at most either where the data came from or is going to, but not both. This decreases the amount of trust required of the individual proxy hosts.
