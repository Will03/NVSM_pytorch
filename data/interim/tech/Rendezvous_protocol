For|the protocol formerly called Rendezvous|Bonjour (software)

A rendezvous protocol is a protocol (computing)|computer network protocol that enables resources or Peer-to-peer|P2P network peers to find each other. A rendezvous protocol uses a handshaking model, unlike an eager protocol which directly copies the data. In a rendezvous protocol the data is sent when the destination says it is ready, but in an eager protocol the data is sent assuming the destination can store the data.<ref>cite web|title=Message protocols|url=http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/tutorial/perf/message-protocols/sld001.htm|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory</ref>

Examples of rendezvous protocols include JXTA, Session Initiation Protocol|SIP, Freenet Project, I2P, and such protocols generally involve hole punching (networking)|hole punching.

Because of Firewall (computing)|firewall network address translation (NAT) issues, rendezvous protocols generally require that there be at least one unblocked and un-NATed server that lets the peers locate each other and initiate concurrent packet (information technology)|packets at each other.
