A personal cloud is a collection of digital content and services which are accessible from any computing device|device. The personal cloud is not a tangible entity. It is a place which gives users the ability to Data storage device|store, synchronize, Streaming media|stream and share content on a relative core, moving from one computing platform|platform, screen and location to another. Created on connected services and application software|applications, it reflects and sets consumersâ€™ expectations for how next-generation computing services will work.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/personal-cloud |title=Gartner IT Glossary - Personal Cloud |publisher=Gartner.com |date=2014-02-18 |accessdate=2014-05-15</ref>citation needed|reason=This source is neither reliable or accurate|date=May 2016

The four primary types of personal cloud in use today are: Online cloud, NAS device cloud, server (computing)|server device cloud, and home-made clouds.

Online cloud
The online cloud is also sometimes referred to as public cloud. Online cloud is the cloud computing model where online resources like software and data storage are made available over the Internet by a service provider. In an online cloud model, cloud services are provided in a virtualized system, are constructed using pooled, shared physical resources and are accessed by the Internet.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.smartercomputingblog.com/cloud-infrastructure/public-private-hybrid-cloud/?cmp=stgsocial%26ct%3Dnone%26cr%3Dstgsocial%26csr%3Dsc%26cm%3Dh%26ccy%3Dus%26cpb%3Dstg&sf25983295=1 |title=Public, private and dynamic hybrid cloud: What's the difference? |publisher=Smarter Computing Blog |date=2014-04-15 |accessdate=2014-05-15</ref>

Typically, an individual or organization has little control over the ecosystem in which the online cloud is hosted, and the core infrastructure is shared between many individuals and organizations. The data and applications provided by the service provider are logically segregated so that only those authorized are allowed access.<ref>cite web|url=http://officeoffinance.com/public-cloud-vs-private-cloud-vs-hybrid-cloud/ |title=Public Cloud vs Private Cloud vs Hybrid Cloud |publisher=Office of Finance |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15</ref>

NAS device cloud
A network-attached storage (NAS) device is a computer connected to a computer network|network that provides only file-based data storage services to other devices on the network. Although it may technically be possible to run other software on a NAS device, it is not designed to be a general purpose server. Cloud NAS is remote storage that is accessed over the Internet as if it were local.

A cloud NAS is often used for backups and archiving.  One of the benefits of NAS Cloud is that data in the cloud can be accessed at any time from anywhere.  The main drawback, however, is that the speed of the transfer rate is only as fast as the network connection the data is accessed over and can therefore be fairly slow.<ref>cite web|url=http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com/definition/cloud-NAS-cloud-netork-attached-storage |title=What is cloud NAS (cloud network attached storage)? - Definition from WhatIs.com |publisher=Searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15</ref>  Three examples of NAS personal clouds are the My Cloud<ref>http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=1140</ref> by Western Digital, the CloudBox<ref>cite web|url=http://www.lacie.com/US/products/product.htm?id=10597 |title=CloudBox |publisher=LaCie |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15</ref> by Lacie, and the Central<ref>cite web|url=http://www.seagate.com/external-hard-drives/home-entertainment/media-sharing-devices/seagate-central/ |title=Home Sharing, Media Streaming, Wireless Backup |publisher=Seagate |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15</ref> by Seagate Technology|Seagate.

Server device cloud
In many ways cloud servers work in the same way as physical servers but the functions they perform can be very different.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.interoute.com/what-are-cloud-servers |title=What are Cloud Servers &#124; Cloud Server Information |publisher=Interoute |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15</ref> Typically, the cloud server is an on-premises device that is connected to the Internet and gives users the functions available on the online cloud but with the added benefit and security of the files being in their control on their premises.

The server cloud has been historically enterprise-based deployed by businesses needing an in-house cloud. However, there are also in-house options available for individual users such as the open-source ownCloud (which runs on Linux), the CloudLocker device by StoAmigo<ref>cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2013/05/30/worried-about-your-data-in-the-cloud-stop-whining-and-get-your-own-cloud/ |title=Worried About Your Data In The Cloud?

Home-made clouds
For the more technologically proficient user a common solution for using a personal cloud<ref>cite web|url=https://www.basefolder.com/index.php/2016/02/10/personal-cloud-storage/ |title=Personal Cloud Storage |publisher=basefolder |date= 2016-02-10 |accessdate=2016-02-10</ref> is to create a home-made cloud system by connecting an external USB hard drive to a wifi|Wi-Fi router (computing)|router. This enables both wired and wireless computers to access the USB hard drive and use it for storage or for retrieving files a user needs to share on the network<ref>cite web|url=http://techchannel.radioshack.com/connect-usb-external-hard-drive-wireless-router-1602.html |title=How to Connect a USB External Hard Drive to a Wireless Router |publisher=RadioShack |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2014-05-15</ref> thereby acting like a cloud.

The challenge for the home-made cloud is that in order to set it up a user has to have a certain degree of skills in technology and network setup. This solution is not for novices and average consumers. If this setup is not done by a tech expert the biggest issue will be security and leaving the files accessible to anyone with technical knowledge.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/535571/default_settings_leave_external_hard_drives_connected_asus_routers_wide_open/ |title=Default settings leave external hard drives connected to Asus routers wide open - Good Gear Guide |work=PC World Australia |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2014-05-15</ref> Not every router supports this type of access and modification.
