In computing, ambient intelligence (AmI) refers to electronic environments that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of people. Ambient intelligence is a Futures studies|vision on the future of consumer electronics, telecommunications and computing that was originally developed in the late 1990s by Eli Zelkha and his team at Palo Alto Ventures for the time frame 2010–2020.<ref>cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1080720|title=Ambient Intelligence: an innovation narrative|journal=Lancs.ac.uk|first=Michael|last=Arribas-Ayllon</ref><ref>cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JfeAlyQX4gYC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=pieper%20digital%20living%20room#v=onepage&q=pieper%20digital%20living%20room&f=false|title=True Visions: The Emergence of Ambient Intelligence|first1=Emile H.

As these devices grow smaller, more connected and more integrated into our environment, the technology disappears into our surroundings until only the user interface remains perceivable by users.

The ambient intelligence paradigm builds upon pervasive computing, ubiquitous computing, profiling (information science)|profiling, context awareness, and Human-centered computing|human-centric computer interaction design, of which, is characterized by systems and technologies that are:<ref>Brian Epstein, Digital Living Room Conference Keynote 1998, (17 June 1998: revised script) https://epstein.org/ambient-intelligence/ accessed 14/12/17</ref>
* embedded system|embedded: many networked devices are integrated into the environment
* Context awareness|context aware: these devices can recognize you and your situational context
* personalization|personalized: they can be tailored to your needs
* adaptive behavior|adaptive: they can change in response to you
* anticipation (artificial intelligence)|anticipatory: they can anticipate your desires without conscious mediation.

A typical context of ambient intelligence environment is home, but may also be extended to work spaces (offices, coworking), public spaces (based on technologies such as Intelligent street lighting|smart street lights), and hospital environments.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.ercim.eu/publication/Ercim_News/enw47/bielikova.html|title=Ambient Intelligence within a Home Environment|website=www.ercim.eu|access-date=2017-12-14</ref>

 Overview 
More and more people make decisions based on the effect their actions will have on their own inner, mental world.vague|date=January 2012  This experience-driven way of acting is a change from the past when people were primarily concerned about the use value of products and services,Dubious|Dubious|date=January 2012 and is the basis for the experience economy. Ambient intelligence addresses this shift in existential view by emphasizing people and user experience.

The interest in user experience also grew in importance in the late 1990s because of the overload of products and services in the information society that were difficult to understand and hard to use. An urge emerged to design things from a user's point of view. Ambient intelligence is influenced by user-centered design where the user is placed in the center of the design activity and asked to give feedback through specific User experience evaluation|user evaluations and tests to improve the design or even co-create the design with the designer (participatory design) or with other users (end-user development).

In order for AmI to become a reality a number of key technologies are required:
* Unobtrusive hardware (miniaturization, nanotechnology, smart devices, sensors etc.)
* Seamless mobile/fixed communication and computing infrastructure (interoperability, wired and wireless networks, service-oriented architecture, Semantic Web|semantic web etc.)
* Dynamic and massively distributed device networks, which are easy to control and program (e.g. service discovery, auto-configuration, end-user programmable devices and systems etc.)
* Human-centric computer interfaces (intelligent agents, multimodal interaction, context awareness etc.)
* Dependable and secure systems and devices (self-testing and self repairing software, privacy ensuring technology etc.)

History and invention
In 1998, the board of management of Philips commissioned a series of presentations and internal workshops, organized by Eli Zelkha and Brian Epstein of Palo Alto Ventures (who, with Simon Birrell, coined the term 'ambient intelligence') to investigate different scenarios that would transform the high-volume consumer electronic industry from the current "fragmented with features" world into a world in 2020 where user-friendly devices support ubiquitous information, communication and entertainment.<ref>cite journal|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:845301/FULLTEXT02|title=Semantic web, ubiquitous computing, or internet of things? A macro-analysis of scholarly publications|date=2015|journal=Journal of Documentation|volume=71|issue=5|pages=884–916|doi=10.1108/JD-03-2013-0033|last=Olson|first=Nasrine|last2=Nolin|first2=Jan|last3=Nelhans|first3=Gustaf</ref> While developing the ambient intelligence concept, Palo Alto Ventures created the keynote address for Roel Pieper of Philips for the Digital Living Room Conference, 1998.<ref>cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JfeAlyQX4gYC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=roel%20pieper%20ambient%20intelligence#v=onepage&q=roel%20pieper%20ambient%20intelligence&f=false|title=True Visions: The Emergence of Ambient Intelligence|first1=Emile H. L.|last1=Aarts|first2=José Luis|last2=Encarnação|date=13 December 2006|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books|isbn=9783540289746</ref> The group included Eli Zelkha, Brian Epstein, Simon Birrell, Doug Randall, and Clark Dodsworth. In the years after, these developments grew more mature. In 2005, Philips joined the Oxygen alliance, an international consortium of industrial partners within the context of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT Oxygen project,<ref>cite web|url=http://www.oxygen.lcs.mit.edu |title=MIT Project Oxygen |publisher=Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |accessdate=2012-06-27</ref> aimed at developing technology for the computer of the 21st century. In 2000, plans were made to construct a feasibility and usability facility dedicated to ambient intelligence. This HomeLab officially opened on 24 April 2002.

Along with the development of the vision at Philips, a number of parallel initiatives started to explore ambient intelligence in more detail. Following the advice of the Information Society and Technology Advisory Group (ISTAG), the European Commission used the vision for the launch of their sixth framework (FP6) in Information, Society and Technology (IST), with a subsidiary budget of 3.7 billion euros. The European Commission played a crucial role in the further development of the AmI vision. As a result of many initiatives the AmI vision gained traction. During the past few years several major initiatives have been started. Fraunhofer Society started several activities in a variety of domains including multimedia, microsystems design and augmented spaces. MIT started an ambient intelligence research group at their Media Lab.<ref>cite web |url=http://ambient.media.mit.edu/ |title=Fluid Interfaces Group |publisher=MIT Media Lab |accessdate=2012-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510050536/http://ambient.media.mit.edu/ |archive-date=2012-05-10 |dead-url=yes |df= </ref> Several more research projects started in a variety of countries such as the US, Canada, Spain, France and the Netherlands. Since 2004, the European Symposium on Ambient Intelligence (EUSAI) and many other conferences have been held that address special topics in AmI.

Criticism

As far as dissemination of information on personal presence is out of control, ambient intelligence vision is subject of criticism (e.g. David Wright, Serge Gutwirth, Michael Friedewald et al., Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence, Springer, Dordrecht, 2008).
Any immersive, personalized, context-aware and anticipatory characteristics brings up societal, political and cultural concerns about the loss of privacy.  The example scenario above shows both the positive and negative possibilities offered by ambient intelligence.  However, it should be noted that applications of ambient intelligence do not necessarily have to reduce privacy in order to work.Citation needed|date=March 2018

Power concentration in large organizations, a fragmented, decreasingly private society and Hyperreality|hyperreal environments where the virtual is indistinguishable from the real are the main topics of critics.<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.clickz.com/no-ads-on-orkut-but-apps-may-come/88217/|title=No Ads on Orkut, but  Come|date=2007-10-08|work=ClickZ|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-US</ref> Several research groups and communities are investigating the socioeconomic, political and cultural aspects of ambient intelligence. New thinking on AmI distances itself therefore from some of the original characteristics such as adaptive and anticipatory behaviour and emphasizes empowerment and participation to place control in the hands of people instead of organizations.Citation needed|date=March 2018

Social and political aspects
The Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|ISTAG advisory group suggests that the following characteristics will permit the societal acceptance of ambient intelligence.

AmI should...
* facilitate human contact.
* be oriented towards community and cultural enhancement.
* help to build knowledge and skills for work, better quality of work, citizenship and consumer choice.
* inspire trust and confidence.
* be consistent with long term sustainability—personal, societal and environmental—and with lifelong learning.
* be made easy to live with and controllable by ordinary people.

Business models
The ISTAG group acknowledges the following entry points to AmI business landscape:
* Initial premium value niche markets in industrial, commercial or public applications where enhanced interfaces are needed to support human performance in fast moving or delicate situations.
* Start-up and spin-off opportunities from identifying potential service requirements and putting the services together that meet these new needs.
* High access-low entry cost based on a loss leadership model in order to create economies of scale (mass customization).
* Audience or customer's attention economy as a basis for 'free' end-user services paid for by advertising or complementary services or goods.
* Self-provision—based upon the network economies of very large user communities providing information as a gift or at near zero cost (e.g. social networking applications).
* The combination of multiple and diverse datasets in a platform for sense-making and understanding consumer behaviour (e.g. Near (company)|Near).

 Technologies 
A variety of technologies can be used to enable Ambient intelligence environments such as Harv|Gasson|Warwick|2007:
* Bluetooth Low Energy
*Radio-frequency identification|RFID
*Microchip implant (human)|Microchip implant
* Sensors: Ambient light sensor (photodetector), Thermometer|thermometers, Proximity sensor|proximity sensors and Motion detector|motion detectors
*Software agent|Software agents
* Affective computing
* Nanotechnology
* Biometrics

 Computing 
This means of computing links all pieces of technology together. This also allows the device to have the capability to remember past requests.<ref>Cite journal|last=Raisinghani|first=Mahesh S.|last2=Benoit|first2=Ally|last3=Ding|first3=Jianchun|last4=Gomez|first4=Maria|last5=Gupta|first5=Kanak|last6=Gusila|first6=Victor|last7=Power|first7=Daniel|last8=Schmedding|first8=Oliver|date=2006-03-30|title=Ambient Intelligence: Changing Forms of Human-Computer Interaction and their Social Implications|url=https://journals.tdl.org/jodi/index.php/jodi/article/view/149|journal=Journal of Digital Information|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|issn=1368-7506</ref>

 Uses in fiction 
* Minority Report (film)|''Minority Report'' (2002 film). One scene illustrates adaptive advertising in the future: consumers are identified via retinal scans, and receive targeted ads Harv|Parker|2002.
* ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' by Douglas Adams. The doors have emotion, and express this when people use them.
** See also: Technology in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Technology in ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''
* ''The Diamond Age'' by Neal Stephenson, depicts a world completely changed by the full development of nanotechnology that is present everywhere.
* Her (film)|''Her'' (2013 film). The opening scene depicts the protagonist commuting home, upon arriving the various lights throughout the apartment are turned on as the character moves through the rooms (Lighting control system|automated lighting control). A later scene shows that an artificial entity can also control these systems, changing a song being played in the background to lighten a situation, and for humorous effect.
