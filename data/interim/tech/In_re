italic title
''In re'', Latin for "in the matter [of]", is a term  with several different, but related meanings.

Jurisprudence
In jurisprudence, ''in re'' is used to indicate that a judicial proceeding may not have formally designated adverse parties or is otherwise uncontested. The term is commonly used in case citations of probate and bankruptcy proceedings, such as the General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.  It is sometimes used for consolidated cases, as with ''In re Marriage Cases''.  It was adopted by certain U.S. states like California when they adopted no-fault divorce to reflect the fact that the modern proceeding for dissolution of marriage was being taken out of the adversarial system.  It is also used in juvenile courts, as, for instance, ''In re Gault''.  The ''Bluebook'' describes ''In re'' as a "procedural phrase", and requires using it to abbreviate "in the matter of", "petition of", "application of", and similar expressions.<ref>cite book | publisher= Columbia Law Review; Harvard Law Review; University of Pennsylvania Law Review; Yale Law Journal | title=Bluebook | edition=19th | isbn=9780615361161 |chapter=Case Names 10.2</ref>
