 International legal standards on privacy 

= Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) =
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC created a voluntary Privacy Framework that was adopted by all 21 member economies in 2004 in an attempt to improve general information privacy and the cross-border transfer of information.<ref name=":1">Cite journal|last=Greenleaf|first=Graham|date=2009|title=Five years of the APEC Privacy Framework: Failure or promise?|ssrn=2022907|journal=Computer Law & Security Report|volume=25|pages=</ref> The Framework consists of nine Privacy Principles that act as minimum standards for privacy protection: Preventing harm, Notice, Collection limitation, Use of personal information, Choice, Integrity of personal information, Security safeguards, Access and correction, and Accountability.<ref name=":1" />

In 2011, APEC implemented the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System with the goal of balancing "the flow of information and data across borders ... essential to trust and confidence in the online marketplace."<ref name=":3">Cite journal|last=Marvin, et al.|first=Lynn M.|date=2015|title=Conducting U.S. Discovery in Asia: An Overview of E-Discovery and Asian Data Privacy Laws|url=https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&context=jolt|journal=Richmond Journal of Law & Technology|volume=21|pages=|via=HeinOnline</ref> The four agreed-upon rules of the System are based upon the APEC Privacy Framework and include self-assessment, compliance review, recognition/acceptance, and dispute resolution and enforcement.<ref name=":3" />

= Council of Europe =
Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was drafted and adopted by the Council of Europe in 1950 and currently covers the whole European continent except for Belarus and Kosovo, protects the right to respect for private life: "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence." Through the huge case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, privacy has been defined and its protection has been established as a positive right of everyone.

The Council of Europe also adopted Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data in 1981 and addressed privacy protection in regards to the Internet in 1998 when it published "Draft Guidelines for the protection of individuals with regard to the collection and processing of personal data on the information highway, which may be incorporated in or annexed to Code of Conduct."<ref name=":4">Cite journal|last=Reidenberg|first=Joel R.|date=2000|title=Resolving Conflicting International Data Privacy Rules in Cyberspace|jstor=1229516|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=52|issue=5|pages=1315–1371</ref> The Council developed these guidelines in conjunction with the European Commission, and they were adopted in 1999.<ref name=":4" />

= European Union (EU) =
The 1995 Data Protection Directive (officially Directive 95/46/EC) recognized the authority of National data protection authority|National data protection authorities and required that all Member state of the European Union|Member States adhere to universal privacy protection standards.<ref name=":4" /> Member States must adopt strict privacy laws that are no more relaxed than the framework provided by the directive.<ref name=":5">Cite journal|last=Bhasin|first=Madan Lal|date=2016|title=Challenge of guarding online privacy: role of privacy seals, government regulations and technological solutions|url=http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.ijfa.20120106.03.html|journal=Socio-Economic Problems & the State|volume=15|pages=|via=EBSCO</ref> Additionally, the Directive outlines that non-EU countries must adopt privacy legislation of equal restriction in order to be allowed to exchange personal data with EU countries. Furthermore, companies in non-EU countries must also adopt privacy standards of at least equal restriction as provided in the Directive in order to do business with companies located in EU countries.<ref name=":5" /> Thus, the Directive has also influenced the development of privacy legislation in non-European countries.<ref name=":4" /> The proposed EPrivacy Regulation (European Union)|ePrivacy Regulation, which would replace the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002, also contributes to EU privacy regulations.

The General Data Protection Regulation has replaced the Data Protection Directive of 1995 when it came to effect on 25 May 2018. A notable contribution that has come from the General Data Protection Regulation is its recognition of a "right to be forgotten", which requires any group that collects data on individuals to delete the data related to an individual upon that individual's request.<ref name=":6">Cite journal|last=Victor|first=Jacob M.|date=November 2013|title=The EU General Data Protection Regulation: Toward a Property Regime for Protecting Data Privacy|url=https://www.jstor.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/pdf/23744289.pdf|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=123|pages=</ref> The Regulation was influenced by the aforementioned European Convention on Human Rights.<ref name=":6" />

= Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) =
In 1980, the OECD adopted the voluntary OECD Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data in response to growing concerns about information privacy and data protection in an increasingly technological and connected world.<ref name=":7">Cite journal|last=Tene|first=Omar|date=2013|title=Privacy Law's Midlife Crisis: A Critical Assessment of the Second Wave of Global Privacy Laws|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ohslj74&collection=journals&id=1255&startid=&endid=1300|journal=Ohio State Law Journal|volume=74|pages=|via=HeinOnline</ref> The OECD Guidelines helped establish an international standard for privacy legislation by defining the term "personal data" and outlining fair information practice principles (FIPPs) that other countries have adopted in their national privacy legislation.<ref name=":7" />

In 2007, the OECD adopted the Recommendation on Cross-border Co-operation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting Privacy.

= United Nations (UN) =
Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the United Nations of 1966 also protects privacy: "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."

On 18 December 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 68/167 on the right to privacy in the digital age. The resolution makes reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirms the fundamental and protected human right of privacy.<ref>Cite journal|title=III.V.7 UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 68/167 (ON THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE)|journal=International Law & World Order: Weston's & Carlson's Basic Documents|doi=10.1163/2211-4394_rwilwo_com_033375</ref>

=Australia=
Main|Privacy in Australian law
The current state of privacy law in Australia includes Federal and state information privacy legislation, some sector-specific privacy legislation at state level, regulation of the media and some criminal sanctions. The current position concerning civil causes of action for invasion of privacy is unclear: some courts have indicated that a tort of invasion of privacy may exist in Australia.<ref>cite AustLII|QDC|151|2003|litigants=Grosse v Purvis |date= |courtname=auto.</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">cite AustLII|VSCA|236|2008|litigants=Giller v Procopets |date=10 December 2008 |courtname=auto.</ref><ref>''Jane Doe v.

=Bahamas=
The Bahamas has an official data protection law that protects the personal information of its citizens in both the private and public sector: Data Protection Act 2003 (the Bahamas Law).<ref name=":12" /> The Bahamas Law appoints a data protection commissioner to the Office of Data Protection to ensure that data protection is being held. Even though there is legislation enforced in the Bahamas through the Data Protection Act 2003, the act lacks many enforcements since a data protection officer doesn't need to be in office nor does any group or organization need to notify the Office of Data Protection when a hacker has breached privacy law. Also, there are no requirements for registering databases or restricting data flow across national borders. Therefore, the legislation does not meet European Union standards, which was the goal of creating the law in the first place.&nbsp;<ref>Bahamas Law. http:// laws.bahamas.gov.bs/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/ 2003/2003-0003/ DataProtectionPrivacyofPersonalInformationAct_1.pdf</ref>

The Bahamas is also a member of Caribbean Community|CARICOM, the Caribbean Community.

=Belize=
Belize is currently part of the minority of countries that do not have any official data privacy laws.<ref name=":2">Greenleaf, Graham. 2015. "Global Data Privacy Laws 2015: 109 Countries, with European Laws Now a Minority"''.'' ''Privacy Laws & Business International Report'' 21.</ref> However, the Freedom of Information Act (2000) currently protects the personal information of the citizens of Belize, but there is no current documentation that distinguishes if this act includes electronic data.<ref name=":12" />

As a consequence of the lack of official data privacy laws, there was a breach of personal data in 2009 when an employee's laptop from Belize's Vital Statistics Unit was stolen, containing birth certification information for all citizens residing in Belize. Even though the robbery was not intentionally targeting the laptop - the robber did not predict the severity of the theft - Belize was put in a vulnerable position which could have been avoided if regulations were in order.

=Brazil=
A Brazilian citizen's privacy is protected by the country's constitution, which states:

:''The intimacy, private life, honor and image of the people are inviolable, with assured right to indenization by material or moral damage resulting from its violation''<ref>[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituicao.htm Constituição da República Federativa do Brasil de 1988 / Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil of 1988]</ref>

=Canada=
Main|Canadian privacy law
In Canada, the federal ''Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act'' (PIPEDA) governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in connection with commercial activities and personal information about employees of federal works, undertakings and businesses. It generally does not apply to non-commercial organizations or provincial governments. Personal information collected, used and disclosed by the federal government and many crown corporations is governed by the ''Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act''. Many provinces have enacted similar provincial legislation such as the Ontario ''Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act'' which applies to public bodies in that province.

There remains some debate whether there exists a common law tort for breach of privacy. There have been a number of cases identifying a common law right to privacy but the requirements have not been articulated.<ref>See for example, ''Somwar v. McDonald's Restaurants of Canada Ltd'', [2006] O.J. No. 64 for a discussion on this</ref>

In ''Eastmond v. Canadian Pacific Railway & Privacy Commissioner of Canada''<ref name=Eastmond>''Eastmond v. Canadian western Railway & Privacy Commissioner of Canada'', 11 June 2004</ref> Canada's Supreme Court found that CP could collect Eastmond's personal information without his knowledge or consent because it benefited from the exemption in paragraph 7(1)(b) of Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act|PIPEDA, which provides that personal information can be collected without consent if "it is reasonable to expect that the collection with the knowledge or consent of the individual would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement".<ref name=Eastmond />

=Germany=
Germany is known to be one of the first countries (in 1970) with the strictest and most detailed data privacy laws in the world. The citizens' right to protection is stated in the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Constitution of Germany, in Art. 2 para. 1, and Art. 1 para. 1.<ref>Tschentscher, Axel, The Basic Law (Grundgesetz) 2016: The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany (23 May 1949) — Introduction and Translation (Fourth Edition) (6 July 2016). SSRN|1501131</ref> The citizens' data of Germany is mainly protected under the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz|Federal Data Protection Act (1977) from corporations, which has been amended the most recently in 2009. This act specifically targets all businesses that collect information for its use. The major regulation protects the data within the private and personal sector, and as a member of the European Union (EU), Germany has additionally ratified its act, convention, and additional protocol with the EU according to the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC.

In Germany, there are two kinds of restrictions on a transfer of personal data. Since Germany is part of the EU Member States, the transfer of personal data of its citizens to a nation outside the EEA is always subject to a decent level of data protection in the offshore country. Secondly, according to German data policy rules, any transfer of personal data outside the EEA symbolizes a connection to a third party which requires a reason. That reason may be for emergency reasons and a provision must be met with consent by the receiver and the subject of the data. Keep in mind that in Germany, data transfers within a group of companies are subject to same treatment as transfer to third-parties if the location is outside the EEA.

Specifically the Federal Data Protection Commission is in charge of regulating the entirety of the enforcement of data privacy regulations for Germany. In addition, Germany is part of the OECD|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).<ref name=":12">Western Hemisphere Data Protection Laws. 2012.

=Greece=
During the military dictatorship era the 57 AK law prohibited taking photos of people without their permission but the law has since been superseded. The 2472/1997 law protects personal data of citizens but consent for taking photos of people is not required as long as they aren't used commercially or are used only for personal archiving ("οικιακή χρήση" / "home use"), for publication in editorial, educational, cultural, scientific or news publications, and for fine art purposes (e.g. street photography which has been uphold as legal by the courts whether done by professional or amateur photographers). However, photographing people or collecting their personal data for commercial (advertising) purposes requires their consent. The law gives photographers the right to commercially use photos of people who have not consented to the use of the images in which they appear if the depicted people have either been paid for the photo session as models (so there is no separation between editorial and commercial models in Greek law) or they have paid the photographer for obtaining the photo (this, for example, gives the right to wedding photographers to advertise their work using their photos of newly-wed couples they photographed in a professional capacity). In Greece the right to take photographs and publish them or sell licensing rights over them as fine art or editorial content is protected by the Constitution of Greece (Article 14<ref>[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/Vouli-ton-Ellinon/To-Politevma/Syntagma/article-14/ Article 14 of the Constitution of Hellas]</ref> and other articles) and free speech laws as well as by Precedent|case law and legal cases. Photographing the police or children and publishing the photographs in a non-commercial capacity is also legal.

As Hong Kong remains a common law jurisdiction, judicial cases are also a source of privacy law.<ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/legal/ Hong Kong Department of Justice — Legal System in Hong Kong]</ref> The power of enforcement is vested with the Privacy Commissioner (the "Commissioner") for Personal Data. Non-compliance with data protection principles set out in the ordinances does not constitute a criminal offense directly. The Commissioner may serve an enforcement notice to direct the data user to remedy the contravention and/or instigate the prosecution action.

The Right to Privacy is a fundamental rights in India|fundamental right and an intrinsic part of Article 21 that protects life and liberty of the citizens and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. In June 2011, India passed a new privacy package that included various new rules that apply to companies and consumers.

=Switzerland=
The main legislation over personal data privacy for the personal and private sector in Switzerland is the Swiss Federal Protection Act, specifically the Data Protection Act, a specific section under the Swiss Federal Protection Act. The Data Protection Act has been enacted since 1992 and is in charge of measuring the consent of sharing of personal data, along with other legislation like the Telecommunication Act and the Unfair Competition Act. The Act generally guides on how to collect, process, store, data, use, disclose, and destruct data. The Data Inspection Board is in charge of overseeing data breaches and privacy enforcement.

Personal data must be protected against illegal use by "being processed in good faith and must be proportionate".<ref name=":0" /> Also, the reason for the transfer of personal data must be known by the time of data transfer. Data not associated with people (not personal data) is not protected by the Data Protection Act.

In the case of data transfer to unsafe data protection countries, these are the major regulations required by the Data Protection Act:
* Need of direct channels for data transfer
* Individual case must have consent from receivers of data
* Disclosure is accessible to public

Switzerland is a white-listed country, meaning that it is a nation that has proper levels of data protection under the surveillance by the European Commission (EU Commission). Switzerland is not under the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC.<ref>Greenleaf, Graham. 2015. "Global Data Privacy Laws 2015: 109 Countries, with European Laws Now a Minority"''.'' ''Privacy Laws & Business International Report.''</ref> However, the data protection regulations are sufficient enough under European Union (EU) regulations without being a member of the EU.

In addition, Switzerland is part of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.<ref name=":12" />

A few other administrative laws also deal with communication-specific personal privacy protection:
* Telecommunications Act
* Communications Protection and Surveillance Act

Additionally, chapter 28 of the Law of Taiwan|Criminal Code outlines punishments for privacy violations in article 315, sections 315-1 and 315-2. The sections primarily address issues of search and seizure and criminal punishment for wrongful invasion of privacy.<ref name=":112"/>

Finally, articles 18(I),184(I), and 195(I) of the Taiwanese s:Portal:Law of the Republic of China|Civil Code address the "personality right" to privacy and the right to compensation when one injures the "rights" of another, such as when someone uses another's name illegally.<ref name=":112" />

As a member of the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Kingdom adheres to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees a "right to respect for privacy and family life" from state parties, subject to restrictions as prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society towards a legitimate aim.

However, there is no independent tort law doctrine which recognises a right to privacy. This has been confirmed on a number of occasions.

Main|Privacy laws of the United States
The right to privacy is not explicitly stated anywhere in the Bill of Rights.
The idea of a right to privacy was first addressed within a legal context in the United States. Louis Brandeis (later a Supreme Court justice) and another young lawyer, Samuel D. Warren, published an article called "The Right to Privacy" in the ''Harvard Law Review'' in 1890 arguing that the United States Constitution and common law allowed for the deduction of a general "right to privacy".<ref>cite journal| url = http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 | title = The Right to Privacy| author = Warren and Brandeis | journal = Harvard Law Review | volume = IV | date = 15 December 1890 | issue = 5 | pages = 193–220| doi=10.2307/1321160| jstor = 1321160</ref>

Their project was never entirely successful, and the renowned tort expert and Dean of the College of Law at University of California, Berkeley, William Lloyd Prosser argued that "privacy" was composed of four separate torts, the only unifying element of which was a (vague) "right to be left alone".<ref>William Lloyd Prosser, "Privacy" (1960) 48 ''California Law Review'', 383</ref> The four torts were:
* Appropriating the plaintiff's identity for the defendant's benefit
* Placing the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye
* Publicly disclosing private facts about the plaintiff
* Unreasonably intruding upon the seclusion or solitude of the plaintiff
One of the central privacy policies concerning minors is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires children under the age of thirteen to gain parental consent before putting any personal information online.<ref>BOYD, danah et al.

Vietnam, lacking a general data protection law, relies on Civil Code regulations relating to personal data protection. Specifically, the Code "protects information relating to the private life of a person."<ref name=":62"/> The 2006 Law on Information Technology protects personal information, such as name, profession, phone number, and email address, and declares that organizations may only use this information for a "proper purpose". The legislation, however, does not define what qualifies as proper.<ref name=":62"/> The 2005 Law on Electronic Transactions protects personal information during electronic transactions by prohibiting organizations and individuals from disclosing "part or all of information related to private and personal affairs ... without prior agreement."<ref>The National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. (2005). "Legislature XI, Session 8: Law on E-Transactions." https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/vnm_e/WTACCVNM43_LEG_5.pdf</ref> The 2010 Law on Protection of Consumers' Rights provides further protection for consumer information, but it does not define the scope of that information or create a data protection authority; additionally, it is only applicable in the private sector.<ref name=":13" />

In 2015, the Vietnam legislature introduced the Law on Information Security, which ensures better information safety and protection online and in user's computer software. It took effect on 1 July 2016 and is Vietnam's first overarching data protection legislation.<ref>Cite journal|last=Treutler, et al.|first=Thomas J.|date=March 2016|title=Legal Update: New Regulations in the ICT Sector in Vietnam|url=http://www.tilleke.com/sites/default/files/2016_Mar_New_Regulations_ICT_Sector_Vietnam.pdf|journal=Tilleke & Gibbins|volume=|pages=|via=</ref>
