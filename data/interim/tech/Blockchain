 History 
File:Confirmed Transactions Per Day.png|thumb|220x220px|Bitcoin transactions (January 2009 – September 2017)
The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /><ref>cite journal|last1=Haber|first1=Stuart|last2=Stornetta|first2=W.

In 1992, Bayer, Haber and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.<ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /><ref>Cite book|last1=Bayer|first1=Dave|last2=Haber|first2=Stuart|last3=Stornetta|first3=W.

The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party.r|cryptocurrencytech The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.R|te20151031

The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite Reproduction (economics)|reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. A blockchain has been described as a ''value-exchange protocol''.<ref name="bc2.0">Cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |title=Block Chain 2.0: The Renaissance of Money |first=Kariappa |last=Bheemaiah |date=January 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2016 |magazine=Wired (magazine)|Wired |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114001509/https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all </ref> A blockchain can maintain title (property)|title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.

=Blocks=
Blocks hold batches of valid Transaction processing|transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.<ref name="te20151031"/> Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.<ref name=te20151031 /> This Iteration|iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block.<ref name="hadc"/>

Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher value can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.<ref name="hadc"/> Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time.  They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks.  Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially<ref name="bsm">cite web |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |title=Bitcoin security model: trust by computation |first=Andreas |last=Antonopoulos |date=20 February 2014 |website=Radar |publisher=O'Reilly |accessdate=19 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031132328/http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |archivedate=31 October 2016 |df=dmy-all </ref> as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.R|te20151031r|t12|p=ch. 08r|paper For example, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network.

= Decentralization =
By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.R|te20151031 The decentralized blockchain may use ad-hoc message passing and distributed networking.

Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that Security hacker|computer crackers can exploit; likewise, it has no central point of failure. Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography.r|primer|p=5 A ''public key'' (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A ''private key'' is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.R|te20151031

= Openness =
Open blockchains are more usability|user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.R|t16|t10|t11|t8|t9 Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term "blockchain" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases.R|t4 Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.<ref name="tapscott201605" />rp|30–31 Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.R|t16|t11 Nikolai Hampton of ''Computerworld'' said that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."<ref name=cw20160905/><ref name="MarTech">cite news |last1=Barry |first1=Levine |title=A new report bursts the blockchain bubble |url=https://martechtoday.com/a-new-report-bursts-the-blockchain-bubble-216959 |accessdate=13 July 2018 |publisher=MarTech |date=11 June 2018</ref>

 Permissionless 
The great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is needed.<ref name="bsm"/> This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport layer.<ref name="bsm"/>

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles.  While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".

Types of blockchains
Currently, there are three types of blockchain networks - public blockchains, private blockchains and consortium blockchains.

=Public blockchains=
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an internet connection can send Financial transaction|transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a Consensus (computer science)|consensus protocol).<ref name=Perfectial>cite web|title= How Companies Can Leverage Private Blockchains to Improve Efficiency and Streamline Business Processes|url=https://perfectial.com/blog/leveraging-private-blockchains-improve-efficiency-streamline-business-processes/|website=Perfectial</ref>sps|date=April 2018 Usually, such networks offer Incentive|economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a Proof-of-stake|Proof of Stake or Proof-of-work system|Proof of Work algorithm.

Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum.

=Private blockchains=
A private blockchain is permissioned.<ref name="btit"/> One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted.

This type of blockchains can be considered a middle-ground for companies that are interested in the blockchain technology in general but are not comfortable with a level of control offered by public networks. Typically, they seek to Incorporation (business)|incorporate blockchain into their accounting and record-keeping procedures without sacrificing autonomy and running the risk of exposing sensitive data to the public internet.

=Consortium blockchains=
A consortium blockchain is often said to be semi-decentralized. It, too, is permissioned but instead of a single organization controlling it, a number of companies might each operate a Node (networking)|node on such a network. The administrators of a consortium chain restrict users' reading rights as they see fit and only allow a limited set of trusted nodes to execute a consensus protocol.
