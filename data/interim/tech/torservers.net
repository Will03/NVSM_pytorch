The police claim the raid was prompted by a blog post from an unrelated activist that promised violence against an upcoming Alternative for Germany convention in Augsburg.<ref>Cite web|url=https://blog.torservers.net/20180704/coordinated-raids-of-zwiebelfreunde-at-various-locations-in-germany.html|title=Coordinated raids of Zwiebelfreunde at various locations in Germany - torservers.net blog|last=torservers.net|website=blog.torservers.net|language=en|access-date=2018-07-08</ref> The blog post was published on a website that used a Riseup.net e-mail address.<ref name="Police searches homes of „Zwiebelfreunde“ board members as well as „OpenLab“ in Augsburg">Cite web |url=https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2018/hausdurchsuchungen-bei-vereinsvorstanden-der-zwiebelfreunde-und-im-openlab-augsburg |title=Police searches homes of "Zwiebelfreunde" board members as well as "OpenLab" in Augsburg |last=n/a |first=46halbe |date=2018-07-04 |website=Chaos Computer Club |access-date=2018-07-06</ref>  Riseup Collective is based in Seattle in the United States, and reported publicly that Zwiebelfreunde does not run its service.<ref>Cite web|url=https://riseup.net/en/about-us/press/zwiebelfreunde|title=Bavarian raids - riseup.net|website=riseup.net|language=en|access-date=2018-07-08</ref>
