DuckDuckGo (DDG) is an Internet web search engine|search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' internet privacy|privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalized search results.<ref name="Buys" /> DuckDuckGo distinguishes itself from other search engines by not profiling its users and by showing all users the same search results for a given search term,<ref>Cite web|url = http://dontbubble.us/|title = dontbubble.us|date = |accessdate = 2014-09-12|website = |publisher = |last = |first = </ref> and emphasizes returning the best results, rather than the most results, generating those results from over 400 individual sources, including Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced sites such as Wikipedia, and other search engines like Bing (search engine)|Bing, Yahoo!

Some of DuckDuckGo's source code is free software hosted at GitHub under the Apache License|Apache 2.0 License,<ref name="Githubduckduckgo">cite web|url=https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo|title=duckduckgo|last=|first=|date=March 16, 2012|publisher=|via=GitHub|accessdate=March 19, 2012</ref> but the core is Proprietary software|proprietary. The company registered the domain names ''ddg.gg'' on February 22, 2011, ''ddg.co'' on September 20, 2013, and acquired ''duck.com'' on December 12, 2018, which are used as shortened URL aliases that redirect to ''duckduckgo.com''.

 Overview 
DuckDuckGo's results are a compilation of "over 400" sources,<ref name="Sources">cite news|url=https://duck.co/help/results/sources|title=Sources|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2018|work=|accessdate=July 22, 2018|publisher=DuckDuckGo Support Center</ref> including Yahoo!

DuckDuckGo positions itself as a search engine that puts privacy first and as such it does not store IP addresses, does not log user information, and uses cookies only when required. Weinberg states: "By default, DuckDuckGo does not collect or share personal information. That is our privacy policy in a nutshell." However, they do maintain logs of all search terms used.<ref>[http://duckduckgo.com/privacy.html "DDG Privacy"]. Duckduckgo.com.</ref>

Weinberg has refined the quality of his search engine results by deleting search results for companies he believes are ''content farm|content mills'', such as Demand Media's eHow, which publishes 4000 articles per day produced by paid freelance writers, which Weinberg says is "low-quality content designed specifically to rank highly in Google's search index". DuckDuckGo also filters pages with substantial advertising.<ref name="Mims26Jul10">cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/post.aspx?bid=377&bpid=25532|title=The Search Engine Backlash Against 'Content Mills'|last=Mims|first=Christopher|date=July 26, 2010|work=Technology Review|accessdate=March 19, 2013</ref>

= Instant Answers =
In addition to the indexed search results, DuckDuckGo displays relevant results, called Instant Answers, on top of the search page. These Instant Answers are collected from either 3rd party APIs or static data sources like text files. The Instant Answers are called ''zeroclickinfo'' because the intention behind these is to provide what the user is searching for on the search result page itself so that the user does not have to click any results to find what they are looking for. As of August 9, 2018, there are 1231 Instant Answers active.<ref>cite web|url=https://duck.co/ia|title=DuckDuckGo Instant Answers</ref>

The Instant Answers are open source<ref>cite web|url=https://github.com/duckduckgo/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=zeroclickinfo-|title=Instant Answer repositories on GitHub|accessdate=Jul 7, 2015</ref> and are maintained on GitHub, where anyone can build or work on them.

= Tor onion service =
In August 2010, DuckDuckGo introduced anonymous searching, including an exit enclave, for its search engine traffic using Tor (anonymity network)|Tor network and enabling access through an onion service. This allows anonymity by routing traffic through a series of encrypted relays. Weinberg stated: "I believe this fits right in line with our privacy policy. Using Tor and DDG, you can now be end to end anonymous with your searching. And if you use our encrypted homepage, you can be end to end encrypted as well."<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/08/duckduckgo-now-operates-a-tor-exit-enclave.html|title=DuckDuckGo now operates a Tor exit enclave|last=|first=|date=13 Aug 2010|website=Gabriel Weinberg's Blog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231132520/http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/08/duckduckgo-now-operates-a-tor-exit-enclave.html|archive-date=31 December 2010|dead-url=|access-date=</ref>

= Bangs =
DuckDuckGo includes "!Bang" keywords, which give users the ability to search on specific third-party websites – using the site's own search engine if applicable. As of  October 2018, 11,414 "bangs" for a diverse range of Internet sites are available.<ref name="bang">cite web|url=https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html|title=!Bang|publisher=Duckduckgo.com|accessdate=October 6, 2018</ref>

 Reception 
In a June 2011 article, Harry McCracken of Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine commended DuckDuckGo, comparing it to his favorite hamburger restaurant, In-N-Out Burger:
quote|It feels a lot like early Google, with a stripped-down home page. Just as In-N-Out doesn't have lattes or Asian salads or sundaes or scrambled eggs, DDG doesn't try to do news or blogs or books or images. There's no auto-completion or instant results. It just offers core Web search—mostly the "ten blue links" approach that's still really useful, no matter what its critics say ... As for the quality, I'm not saying that Weinberg has figured out a way to return more relevant results than Google's mighty search team. But DuckDuckGo ... is really good at bringing back useful sites. It all feels meaty and straightforward and filler-free ...<ref name="McCracken16Jun11">Cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/06/16/duck-duck-go-the-in-n-out-burger-of-search-engines/#ixzz1PXPmPOeK|title=Duck Duck Go, the In-N-Out Burger of Search Engines|last=McCracken|first=Harry|date=June 14, 2011|work=Time (magazine)|Time|accessdate=March 19, 2013</ref>|sign=|source= The barebones approach cited in his quote have since changed; DuckDuckGo now has auto-completion and instant results for example.
