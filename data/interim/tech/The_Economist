When the news magazine was founded, the term "economism" denoted what would today be termed "economic liberalism". ''The Economist'' generally supports free trade, globalisation,<ref>cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17732859|title=Globalisation: The redistribution of hope|date=16 December 2010|work=The Economist|accessdate=23 April 2011</ref> and free immigration.

''The Economist'' favours the support, through central banks, of banks and other important corporations. This principle can, in a much more limited form, be traced back to Walter Bagehot, the third editor of ''The Economist'', who argued that the Bank of England should support major banks that got into difficulties. Karl Marx deemed ''The Economist'' the "European organ" of "the aristocracy of finance".<ref>cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte|year=1852|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch06.htm</ref>

quotation|What, besides free trade and free markets, does ''The Economist'' believe in? "It is to the Radicals that ''The Economist'' still likes to think of itself as belonging. The extreme centre is the paper's historical position". That is as true today as when Crowther [Geoffrey, ''Economist'' editor 1938–1956] said it in 1955. ''The Economist'' considers itself the enemy of privilege, pomposity and predictability. It has backed conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It has supported the Americans in Vietnam. But it has also endorsed Harold Wilson and Bill Clinton, and espoused a variety of liberal causes: opposing capital punishment from its earliest days, while favouring penal reform and decolonisation, as well as—more recently—gun control and gay marriage.<ref name="About us">cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/help/about-us#About_The_Economist|title=About us|accessdate=21 September 2016|work=The Economist|date=18 November 2010</ref>

Though it has many individual columns, by tradition and current practice the magazine ensures a uniform voice—aided by the anonymity of writers—throughout its pages,<ref>Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/styleguide/introduction|title=Style Guide | accessdate=8 February 2013|work=The Economist|date=27 September 2011</ref> as if most articles were written by a single author, which may be perceived to display dry, understated wit, and precise use of language.<ref>Cite news|url= http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=673927|title=The Economist – Tone|accessdate=27 December 2006|work=The Economist  </ref><ref>cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/research/johnson/ |title=Johnson |accessdate=27 December 2006 |work=The Economist |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061219221031/http://www.economist.com/research/johnson/ |archivedate=19 December 2006 </ref> ''The Economist'' has traditionally—albeit not always consistently—persisted in referring to itself as a "newspaper", rather than a newsmagazine, due to the gradual pace of its transformation in format from newsprint to glossy colour (articles were printed on the front page into the 1950s) in addition to its general focus on current affairs as opposed to specialist subjects.<ref name="pgazette" />

''The Economist'''s treatment of economics presumes a working familiarity with fundamental concepts of classical economics. For instance, it does not explain terms like invisible hand, macroeconomics, or demand curve, and may take just six or seven words to explain the theory of comparative advantage. Articles involving economics do not presume any formal training on the part of the reader and aim to be accessible to the educated layman. It usually does not translate short French (and German) quotes or phrases. It does describe the business or nature of even well-known entities, writing, for example, "Goldman Sachs, an investment bank".<ref>cite web|url=http://www.economist.co.uk/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10740475&CFID=1952750&CFTOKEN=20002991|title=A bank by any other name|accessdate=16 September 2008|work=The Economistdead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes </ref>

Many articles include some witticism; image captions are often humorous puns and the letters section usually concludes with an odd or light-hearted letter. These efforts at humour have sometimes had a mixed reception. For example, the cover of the 20 September 2003 issue, headlined by a story on the World Trade Organization|WTO ministerial meeting in Cancún, featured a cactus Finger (gesture)|giving the middle finger.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/images/20030920/20030920issuecovUS400.jpg Issue Cover for 20 September 2003], economist.com</ref> Readers sent both positive and negative letters in response.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_NDJJSJP Letters: Pointing the Finger], ''The Economist'', 2 October 2003.</ref>

=Editorial anonymity=
Articles often take a definite editorial stance and almost never carry a byline. Not even the name of the editor (since 2015, Zanny Minton Beddoes<ref>cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/22/economist-magazine-appoints-its-first-female-editor|title=Economist magazine appoints its first female editor|author=Stuart Kemp|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=29 June 2015</ref>) is printed in the issue. It is a long-standing tradition that an editor's only signed article during their tenure is written on the occasion of their departure from the position. The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances: when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces; when journalists of ''The Economist'' compile special reports (previously known as surveys); for the Year in Review special edition; and to highlight a potential conflict of interest over a book review. The names of ''The Economist'' editors and correspondents can be located on the media directory pages of the website.<ref>cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/mediadirectory|title=Media directory|publisher=''The Economist''|date=|accessdate=25 May 2012</ref> Online blog pieces are signed with the initials of the writer and authors of print stories are allowed to note their authorship from their personal web sites.<ref>cite web|url=http://andreaskluth.org/2008/11/20/why-the-economist-has-no-bylines/|title=Why The Economist has no bylines |work=Andreaskluth.org|accessdate=25 May 2012</ref> "This approach is not without its faults (we have four staff members with the initials "J.P.", for example) but is the best compromise between total anonymity and full bylines, in our view", wrote one anonymous writer of The Economist.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/09/economist-explains-itself-1/|title=Why are The Economist's writers anonymous? |work=The Economist|accessdate=25 September 2016</ref>

The writers of the titled opinion columns tend to refer to themselves by the title (hence, a sentence in the "Lexington" column might read "Lexington was informed...").

The American author Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis has criticised the magazine's editorial anonymity, labeling it a means to hide the youth and inexperience of those writing articles. In 1991 Lewis quipped: "The magazine is written by young people pretending to be old people ... If American readers got a look at the pimply complexions of their economic gurus, they would cancel their subscriptions in droves".<ref name="fallows">cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/1991/10/-quot-the-economics-of-the-colonial-cringe-quot-about-the-economist-magazine-washington-post-1991/7415/|title=The Economics of the Colonial Cringe: Pseudonomics and the Sneer on the Face of The Economist.|accessdate=27 April 2008|work=Washington Post</ref> Although individual articles are written anonymously, there is no secrecy over who the writers are as they are listed on ''The Economist'''s website, which also provides summaries of their careers and academic qualifications.<ref>cite web|title=Media directory|url=http://mediadirectory.economist.com/|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=31 December 2017</ref>

John Ralston Saul describes ''The Economist'' as a "...magazine which hides the names of the journalists who write its articles in order to create the illusion that they dispense disinterested truth rather than opinion. This sales technique, reminiscent of pre-Reformation Catholicism, is not surprising in a publication named after the social science most given to wild guesses and imaginary facts presented in the guise of inevitability and exactitude. That it is the Bible of the corporate executive indicates to what extent received wisdom is the daily bread of a managerial civilization."<ref>cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Doubters-Companion-Dictionary-Aggressive/dp/0743236602/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1371497990&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Doubter%27s+Companion%3A+A+Dictionary+of+Aggressive+Common+Sense |title=The Doubter's Companion: A Dictionary of Aggressive Common Sense |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=9 August 2013</ref>

Circulation
Each of ''The Economist'' issue's official date range is from Saturday to the following Friday. ''The Economist'' posts each week's new content online at approximately 2100 Thursday evening UK time, ahead of the official publication date.<ref>cite news|title=The Economist launches on Android|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/08/service-announcement|accessdate=26 February 2018|work=The Economist|date=2 August 2011|language=en</ref>

In 1877, the publication's circulation was 3,700, and in 1920 it had risen to 6,000. Circulation increased rapidly after 1945, reaching 100,000 by 1970.<ref name="About us" />

Circulation is audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations (UK)|Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC). From around 30,000 in 1960 it has risen to near 1 million by 2000 and by 2016 to about 1.3 million.<ref>cite web|url=http://digiday.com/publishers/economist-aims-double-circulation-profits-5-years/|title=The Economist Plans to Double Circulation Profits in 5 Years|publisher=''Digiday'' |author=Lucinda Southern |date=17 February 2016 |access-date=7 July 2016</ref> Sales inside North America were in 2007 around 54 per cent of the total, with sales in the UK making up 14 per cent of the total and continental Europe 19 per cent.

Of its American readers, two out of three earn more than $100,000 a year.<ref name="gainsreaders">cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5250996|title='Economist' Magazine Wins American Readers|date=8 March 2006|accessdate=27 December 2006|work=National Public Radio|NPR </ref>

''The Economist'' once boasted about its limited circulation. In the early 1990s it used the slogan "''The Economist'' – not read by millions of people". "Never in the history of journalism has so much been read for so long by so few," wrote Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Geoffrey Crowther, a former editor.<ref>Cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3D3B56996BE43&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM

The Economist Newspaper Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Economist Group. The publications of the group include the ''CFO'' brand family as well as the annual ''The World in...'', the lifestyle bimonthly ''1843 (magazine)|1843'', ''European Voice'', and ''Roll Call''. Sir Evelyn Robert de Rothschild was Chairman of the company from 1972 to 1989.

Letters
''The Economist'' frequently receives letters from senior businesspeople, politicians, ambassadors, and from spokespeople for various government departments, non-governmental organisations and lobbies. Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of corporate social responsibility, published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from Oxfam, the World Food Programme, United Nations Global Compact, the Chairman of BT Group, an ex-Director of Royal Dutch Shell|Shell and the UK Institute of Directors.<ref>cite web |url= http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/542754 |title= Compilation: Full text of responses to Economist survey on Corporate Social Responsibility (January–February 2005)|accessdate=3 February 2007|work=Business & Human Rights</ref>

Many of the letters published are critical of its stance or commentary. After ''The Economist'' ran a critique of Amnesty International and human rights in general in its issue dated 24 March 2007, its letters page ran a vibrant reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.<ref>Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8954694|title=Letters: On Amnesty International and human rights, Iraq, tax breaks 4&nbsp;April 2007|accessdate=9 November 2007|work=The Economist|date=4 April 2007</ref> Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local right-of-reply laws without compromising editorial independence.<ref>cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnZjYJ3TduUC&pg=PA173 |title=The Media Enthralled: Singapore Revisited|author=Francis T.

It is extremely rare for any comment by ''The Economist'' to appear alongside any published letter. Letters published in the news magazine are typically between 150 and 200 words long (and began with the salutation "Sir" until the editorship of Zanny Minton Beddoes, the first female editor; they now have no salutation). Previous to a change in procedure, all responses to on-line articles were usually published in "The Inbox".<ref>cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/debate/theinbox/ |title=Latest blog posts |publisher=''The Economist'' |date= |accessdate=9 August 2013</ref> Comments can now be made directly under each article.

''The Economist'' published in 2015 its first US college rankings, focused on comparable economical advantages defined as 'the economic value of a university is equal to the gap between how much its students subsequently earn, and how much they might have made had they studied elsewhere'. Based on set of strict criteria sourced from US Department of Education ("College Scorecard") with relevant 'expected earnings' and multiple statistics applied in calculation of 'median earnings' conclusive evaluation method has been applied to run the scorecard's earnings data through a multiple regression analysis, a common method of measuring the relationships between variables.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/10/value-university |title= The Economist "The value of university: Our first-ever college rankings"  |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=29 October 2015</ref>

Censorship
Sections of ''The Economist'' criticising authoritarian regimes are frequently removed from the magazine by the authorities in those countries. ''The Economist'' regularly has difficulties with the ruling party of Singapore, the People's Action Party, which had successfully sued it, in a Singaporean court, for Defamation|libel.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HL01Ae01.html|title=Inconvenient truths in Singapore|accessdate=31 January 2007|work=Asia Times </ref>

Like many other publications, ''The Economist'' is subjected to censorship in India whenever it depicts a map of Kashmir. The maps are stamped by Indian Customs officials as being "neither correct, nor authentic". Issues are sometimes delayed, but not stopped or seized.<ref>cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/asiaview/2010/12/censorship_india|title=Censorship in India|work=The Economist | date=7 December 2010</ref>

In a separate incident, the government of Zimbabwe went further and imprisoned ''The Economist'''s correspondent there, Andrew Meldrum. The government charged him with violating a statute on "publishing untruth" for writing that a woman was decapitated by supporters of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front party. The decapitation claim was retracted<ref>cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=2574 |title=Guardian and RFI correspondent risks two years in jail |accessdate=2 April 2014 |work=Reporters Without Borders |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404211952/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=2574 |archivedate=4 April 2009 </ref> and allegedly fabricated by the woman's husband. The correspondent was later acquitted, only to receive a deportation order.

On 19 August 2013, ''The Economist'' disclosed that the Missouri Department of Corrections had censored its issue of 29 June 2013. According to the letter sent by the department, prisoners were not allowed to receive the issue because "1. it constitutes a threat to the security or discipline of the institution; 2. may facilitate or encourage criminal activity; or 3. may interfere with the rehabilitation of an offender".<ref>cite news|title=The Economist in prison: About that missing issue|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2013/08/economist-prison|work=The Economist|accessdate=2 April 2014|date=19 August 2013</ref>

Criticism, accusation and praise
In 1991, James Fallows argued in ''The Washington Post'' that ''The Economist'' used editorial lines that contradicted the news stories they purported to highlight.<ref name="fallows" /> In 1999, Andrew Sullivan complained in ''The New Republic'' that it uses "marketing genius"<ref>Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/politics/london-fog|title=London Fog|accessdate=2 September 2014</ref> to make up for deficiencies in analysis and original reporting, resulting in "a kind of ''Reader's Digest''"<ref name="autogenerated1">Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3874750,00.html|title=Not so groovy.|accessdate=27 April 2008|work=The New Republic| location=London| date=14 June 1999</ref> for America's corporate elite.<ref>cite web |last=Finkel |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news1999/july99/news4707.html |title=Nasty barbs fly between New Republic and Economist |date=July 1999 |accessdate=27 April 2008 |publisher=Media Life |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107024913/http://www.medialifemagazine.com:8080/news1999/july99/news4707.html |archivedate=7 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all </ref> Although he acknowledged that the magazine's claim about the dotcom bubble bursting would probably be accurate in the long run (the bubble burst in the US market two years later),<ref>cite web|url=http://www.dataandinvestmentconsult.com/investment-research/effects-of-recession-and-dot-com-bubble.html|title=Effects of Recession and Dot Com Bubble|publisher=Data and Investment Consult|accessdate=8 May 2011</ref> Sullivan pointed out that the magazine greatly exaggerated the danger the US economy was in after the Dow Jones fell to 7,400 during the 1998 Labor Day weekend. He also said that ''The Economist'' is editorially constrained because so many scribes graduated from the same college at Oxford University, Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> ''The Guardian'' wrote that "its writers rarely see a political or economic problem that cannot be solved by the trusted three-card trick of privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation".<ref name="autogenerated2">cite news |last=Stern |first=Stefan |date=21 August 2005 |title=Economist thrives on female intuition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/aug/21/pressandpublishing.business1 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=2 January 2013</ref>

In 2008, Jon Meacham, former editor of ''Newsweek'' and a self-described "fan", criticised ''The Economist'''s focus on analysis over original reporting.<ref>cite news |title=Jon Meacham Wants Newsweek to Be More Like Hayes' Esquire |url=http://www.observer.com/node/39374 |work=New York Observer |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522125448/http://www.observer.com/node/39374 |archive-date=22 May 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2008</ref>

In 2014, the magazine withdrew a harshly-criticised review of a book by Edward E. Baptist|Edward Baptist on slavery and American capitalism. ''The Economist'' had complained that "[a]lmost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains".<ref>cite news |title = Blood cotton |url = https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21615482-how-slaves-built-american-capitalism-blood-cotton |work = economist.com |accessdate = 6 September 2014 </ref> Baptist attributed the harsh review to the magazine's adherence to "Market fundamentalism|free-market fundamentalist" theories, "the idea that everything would be better if measured first and last by its efficiency at producing profit".<ref>Edward Baptist (7 September 2014).

=Praise and accolades=
In 2005, the ''Chicago Tribune'' named it the best English-language magazine noting its strength in international reporting "where it does not feel moved to cover a faraway land only at a time of unmitigated disaster" and that it kept a wall between its reporting and its more conservative editorial policies.<ref>Entertainment: 50 Best Magazines, Chicago Tribune, 15 June 2006.</ref>
