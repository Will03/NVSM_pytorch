History
''Businessweek'' was first published in September 1929, weeks before the stock market crash of 1929. The magazine provided information and opinions on what was happening in the business world at the time. Early sections of the magazine included marketing, labor, finance, management and Washington Outlook, which made ''Businessweek'' one of the first publications to cover national political issues that directly impacted the business world.<ref>cite web |title=A historical perspective of Businessweek, sold to Bloomberg |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |url=http://www.talkingbiznews.com/1/a-historical-perspective-of-businessweek-sold-to-bloomberg/ |publisher=Talking Biz News</ref>

''Businessweek'' was originally published to be a resource for business managers. However, in the 1970s, the magazine shifted its strategy and added consumers outside the business world.<ref name="auto"/> As of 1975, the magazine was carrying more advertising pages annually than any other magazine in the United States.<ref name="Jackson2010">cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of New York City |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI5ERUmHf3YC&pg=PT957 |publisher=Yale University Press; New‑York Historical Society |date=2010 |page=957 |editor1-first=Kenneth T. |editor1-last=Jackson |editor2-first=Lisa |editor2-last=Keller |editor3-first=Nancy V. |editor3-last=Flood |location=New Haven |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-300-18257-6 |lccn=2010-31294 |oclc=842264684 |ol=25891135M</ref>  ''Businessweek'' began publishing its annual rankings of United States business school Master of Business Administration|MBA programs in 1988.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/06/full_time.htm|title=BusinessWeek Business School Rankings|work=BusinessWeek|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603221452/http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/06/full_time.htm|archivedate=June 3, 2007|deadurl=yes|accessdate=January 23, 2007|df=</ref>

Stephen B. Shepard served as editor-in-chief from 1984 until 2005 when he was chosen to be the founding dean of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. Under Shepard, ''Businessweek'''s readership grew to more than six million in the late 1980s.<ref>cite news |title=Controlling 'insider' information is impossible |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/474002621.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jul+31%2C+1988&author=Philip+Moeller+Special+to+The+Star&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=Controlling+%27insider%27+information+is+impossible&pqatl=google |work=Toronto Star |first=Philip |last=Moeller |date=July 31, 1988</ref> He was succeeded by Stephen J.

=Recession and Bloomberg LP acquisition=
''Businessweek'' suffered a decline in circulation during the late-2000s recession as advertising revenues fell one-third by the start of 2009 and the magazine's circulation fell to 936,000. In July 2009, it was reported that McGraw-Hill was trying to sell ''Businessweek'' and had hired Evercore Partners to conduct the sale. Because of the magazine's liabilities, it was suggested that it might change hands for the nominal price of $1 to an investor who was willing to incur losses turning the magazine around.<ref>cite news |title=Business Week sale may fetch only $1 |first=Andrew |last=Edgecliffe-Johnson |date=July 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2013 |url=https://www.ft.com/content/bd68cdc6-6fdc-11de-b835-00144feabdc0 |work=Financial Times|url-access=subscription</ref>

In late 2009, Bloomberg L.P. bought the magazine—reportedly for between $2nbspmillion to $5nbspmillion plus assumption of liabilities—and renamed it ''Bloomberg BusinessWeek''.<ref>cite web |title=Bloomberg to take over BusinessWeek |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/33299108/ns/business-media_biz/ |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC</ref><ref>cite web |first=Tom |last=Lowry |title=Bloomberg Wins Bidding For BusinessWeek |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 13, 2011 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/FineOnMedia/archives/2009/10/bloomberg_wins.html |work=BusinessWeek |agency=On Media (blog)</ref> It is now believed McGraw-Hill received the high end of the speculated price, at $5nbspmillion, along with the assumption of debt.

In early 2010, the magazine title was restyled ''Bloomberg Businessweek'' (with a lowercase "w") as part of a redesign.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.spd.org/2010/04/bloomberg-businessweek-redesig.php|title=Bloomberg Businessweek Redesign|last=Klenert|first=Josh|date=April 26, 2010|publisher=Society of Publication Designers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310035607/http://www.spd.org/2010/04/bloomberg-businessweek-redesig.php|archive-date=March 10, 2011|dead-url=yes|accessdate=April 13, 2011|df=mdy-all</ref> As of 2014, the magazine was losing $30nbspmillion per year, about half of the $60nbspmillion it was reported losing in 2009.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b7fe4a52-7ff1-11e4-adff-00144feabdc0|title=Bloomberg believes in Businessweek as a model|work=Financial Times|accessdate=October 13, 2017|first=Shannon |last=Bond|date=December 10, 2014|url-access=subscription</ref> Adler resigned as editor-in-chief and was replaced by Josh Tyrangiel, who had been deputy managing editor of ''Time (magazine)|Time'' magazine.<ref>cite news |first=Stephanie |last=Clifford |title=Deputy at Time Magazine to Be BusinessWeek Editor |date=November 18, 2009 |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/business/media/18mag.html |work=The New York Times |page=B3</ref> In 2016 Bloomberg announced changes to Businessweek, which was losing between $20 and $30 million.

Criticism and controversies
On October 4, 2018, ''Bloomberg Businessweek'' published a [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies report] (by Jordan Roberson and Michael Riley) claiming that China had hacked dozens of technology corporations including Amazon (company)|Amazon and Apple Inc.|Apple by placing an extra integrated circuit on a Supermicro server motherboard during manufacturing. The claim has been heavily questioned. The report was refuted by Amazon, Apple and Supermicro. The United States security department DHS and UK's GCHQ put out statements that they saw no reason to question those refutations.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/dhs-and-gchq-join-amazon-and-apple-in-denying-bloomberg-chip-hack-story/|title=DHS and GCHQ join Amazon and Apple in denying Bloomberg chip hack story|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=Oct 7, 2018</ref> NSA claims to have no knowledge of the attack. FBI, who was named by Bloomberg to be investigating the alleged attack, is prevented from commenting on it, but notes that it would have an obligation to inform US companies of attacks like these, should they occur.  Experts describe the attack as implausible and in technical details impossible.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.servethehome.com/investigating-implausible-bloomberg-supermicro-stories/|title=Investigating Implausible Bloomberg Supermicro Stories|publisher=ServeTheHome|accessdate=Oct 30, 2018</ref> One source quoted in the Bloomberg text claims that several details of the attack as described by Bloomberg are identical to hypothetical scenarios that he presented to Bloomberg. No other media organization has, by the end of October, corroborated the story. None of the 30 companies that Bloomberg claims were hit by the infiltration have confirmed this. Apple's CEO and Amazon's Chief technology officer|CTO have demanded that Bloomberg retract the story.
