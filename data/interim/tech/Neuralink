Overview

In April 2017, a blog called ''Wait But Why'' reported  that the company aims to make devices to treat serious brain diseases in the short-term, with the eventual goal of human enhancement, sometimes called transhumanism.<ref name="WBW">cite web|url=http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html|title=Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future|last=Urban|first=Tim|date=20 April 2017|work=Wait But Why</ref><ref name="LAT2017-04" /><ref name=Ars>cite news|last1=Newitz|first1=Annalee|title=Elon Musk is setting up a company that will link brains and computers|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/03/elon-musk-is-setting-up-a-company-that-will-link-brains-and-computers/|work=Ars Technica|date=March 27, 2017|language=en-us</ref> Musk said he got partly interested in the idea from a science fiction concept called "neural lace" that is part of the fictional universe in ''The Culture'', a series of novels by Iain M. Banks.<ref name="Ars" /><ref name="1843mag">cite web|last1=Cross|first1=Tim|title=The novelist who inspired Elon Musk|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/culture/the-daily/the-novelist-who-inspired-elon-musk|publisher=1843 Magazine|date=31 March 2017</ref>

Musk explained that the long-term goal is to achieve "symbiosis with artificial intelligence",<ref name='Asher 2018'> [https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-ai-could-turn-humans-into-endangered-species-2018-11 Elon Musk believes AI could turn humans into an endangered species like the mountain gorilla].

Tyler Lacoma, ''Digital Trends''. 7 November 2017.</ref> At present time, some neuroprosthetics can interpret brain signals and allow disabled people to control their prosthetic arms and legs.  Musk aims to link that technology with implants that, instead of actuating movement, can interface at broadband speed with other types of external software and gadgets.<ref name='Lacoma 2017'/>  

As of 2018, the company had applied for a license to open an animal testing facility in San Francisco but apparently had not opened one, and instead carried out research at University of California, Davis|UC Davis.<ref name=Gizmodo2018>Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-neuralink-sought-to-open-an-animal-testing-f-1823167674|title=Elon Musk's Neuralink Sought to Open an Animal Testing Facility in San Francisco|last=Conger|first=Kate|date=|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US</ref>

As of 2018, Neuralink is headquartered in Mission District, San Francisco|San Francisco's Mission District, sharing an office building with OpenAI, another company co-founded by Musk.<ref name=Gizmodo2018/>
