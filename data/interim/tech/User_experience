User experience (UX) refers to a person's emotions and attitudes about using a particular Product (business)|product, system or service. It includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person’s perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency. User experience may be considered subjective in nature to the degree that it is about individual perception and thought with respect to the system. User experience is dynamic as it is constantly modified over time due to changing usage circumstances and changes to individual systems as well as the wider usage context in which they can be found. In the end, user experience is about how the user interacts with and experiences the product.

 Definitions 

The international standard on ''ergonomics of human system interaction'', ISO 9241#ISO 9241-210|ISO 9241-210,<ref>cite book|title= Ergonomics of human system interaction - Part 210: Human-centered design for interactive systems (formerly known as 13407) | author= International Organization for Standardization |id= ISO F±DIS 9241-210:2009 | year=2009</ref> defines user experience as "a person's perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service". According to the ISO definition, user experience includes all the users' emotions, beliefs, preferences, perceptions, physical and psychological responses, behaviors and accomplishments that occur before, during and after use. The ISO also list three factors that influence user experience: system, user and the context of use.

Note 3 of the standard hints that usability addresses aspects of user experience, e.g. "usability criteria can be used to assess aspects of user experience". The standard does not go further in clarifying the relation between user experience and usability. Clearly, the two are overlapping concepts, with usability including pragmatic aspects (getting a task done) and user experience focusing on users’ feelings stemming both from pragmatic and hedonic aspects of the system. Many practitioners use the terms interchangeably. The term usability pre-dates the term user experience. Part of the reason the terms are often used interchangeably is that, as a practical matter, a user will at minimum require sufficient usability to accomplish a task, while the feelings of the user may be less important, even to the user herself. Since usability is about getting a task done, aspects of user experience like information architecture and user interface can help or hinder a user's experience. If a website has "bad" information architecture and a user has a difficult time finding what they are looking for, then a user will not have an effective, efficient and satisfying search.

In addition to the ISO standard, there exist several other definitions for user experience.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions|title=User experience definitions|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113235753/http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions|archivedate=13 January 2012|df=dmy-all</ref> Some of them have been studied by Law et al.<ref>cite conference |title= Understanding, Scoping and Defining User Experience: A Survey Approach |last1= Law |first1= E. |last2= Roto |first2= V. |last3= Hassenzahl |first3= M. |last4= Vermeeren |first4= A. |last5= Kort |first5= J. |date= 4–9 April 2009 |conference= CHI’09 |booktitle= Proceedings of Human Factors in Computing Systems conference |publisher=  |location= Boston, MA, USA |url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arnold_Vermeeren/publication/221518375_Understanding_scoping_and_defining_user_experience_A_survey_approach/links/00463514184e5eb983000000.pdf |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170911071533/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arnold_Vermeeren/publication/221518375_Understanding_scoping_and_defining_user_experience_A_survey_approach/links/00463514184e5eb983000000.pdf |archivedate= 11 September 2017 |df= dmy-all </ref>

 History 

Early developments in user experience can be traced back to the machine age that includes the 19th and early 20th centuries. Inspired by the machine age intellectual framework, a quest for improving assembly processes to increase production efficiency and output led to the development of major technological advancements, such as mass production of high-volume goods on moving assembly lines, high-speed printing press, large hydroelectric power production plants, and radio technology to name a few.

Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford were in the forefront of exploring new ways to make human labor more efficient and productive. Taylor’s pioneering research into the efficiency of interactions between workers and their tools is the earliest example that resembles today’s user experience fundamentals.Citation needed|date=August 2016

The term ''user experience'' was brought to wider knowledge by Donald Norman in the mid-1990s.<ref>Donald Norman, Jim Miller, Austin Henderson: [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Norman/publication/202165701_What_You_See_Some_of_What's_in_the_Future_And_How_We_Go_About_Doing_It_HI_at_Apple_Computer/links/565a122808ae4988a7b96b97/What-You-See-Some-of-Whats-in-the-Future-And-How-We-Go-About-Doing-It-HI-at-Apple-Computer.pdf What You See, Some of What's in the Future, And How We Go About Doing It: HI at Apple Computer] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020180748/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Norman/publication/202165701_What_You_See_Some_of_What's_in_the_Future_And_How_We_Go_About_Doing_It_HI_at_Apple_Computer/links/565a122808ae4988a7b96b97/What-You-See-Some-of-Whats-in-the-Future-And-How-We-Go-About-Doing-It-HI-at-Apple-Computer.pdf |date=20 October 2017 . Proceedings of CHI 1995, Denver, Colorado, USA</ref> He never intended the term "user experience" to be applied only to the affective aspects of usage. A review of his earlier work <ref>Buley, Leah. 2013, The User Experience Team of One: A Research and Design Survival Guide. Rosenfield Media, LLC, USA.</ref> suggests that the term "user experience" was used to signal a shift to include affective factors, along with the pre-requisite behavioral concerns, which had been traditionally considered in the field. Many usability practitioners continue to research and attend to affective factors associated with end-users, and have been doing so for years, long before the term "user experience" was introduced in the mid-1990s.citation needed|date=October 2014 In an interview in 2007, Norman discusses the widespread use of the term "user experience" and its imprecise meaning as a consequence thereof.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.adaptivepath.org/ideas/e000862/|title=Peter in Conversation with Don Norman About UX & Innovation|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207190602/http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/e000862/|archivedate=7 December 2013|df=dmy-all</ref>

Several developments affected the rise of interest in the user experience

# Recent advances in Mobile device|mobile, Ubiquitous computing|ubiquitous, Social network service|social, and Tangible User Interface|tangible computing technologies have moved human-computer interaction into practically all areas of human activity. This has led to a shift away from usability engineering to a much richer scope of user experience, where users' feelings, motivations, and values are given as much, if not more, attention than efficiency, effectiveness and basic subjective satisfaction (i.e. the three traditional Usability#Metrics|usability metrics<ref>ISO 9241-11:1998, Ergonomics of Human System Interaction: Guidance on usability</ref>).<ref>cite web|url=http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ict/Actions/transectorial_it_design_and_evaluation|title=COST - Towards the Integration of Transectorial IT Design and Evaluation (End date: November 2013)|author=|date=|website=www.cost.eu|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314024733/http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ict/Actions/transectorial_it_design_and_evaluation|archivedate=14 March 2015|df=dmy-all</ref>
# In website design, it was important to combine the interests of different stakeholders: marketing, branding, visual design, and usability. Marketing and branding people needed to enter the interactive world where usability was important. Usability people needed to take marketing, branding, and aesthetic needs into account when designing websites. User experience provided a platform to cover the interests of all stakeholders: making web sites easy to use, valuable, and effective for visitors. This is why several early user experience publications focus on website user experience.<ref>Fleming, J. 1998, [http://jepelet.free.fr/studies/MBA/design/s4/lectures/Web%20Navigation%20Designing%20the%20User%20Experience.pdf Web Navigation: Designing the User Experience] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810193542/http://jepelet.free.fr/studies/MBA/design/s4/lectures/Web%20Navigation%20Designing%20the%20User%20Experience.pdf |date=10 August 2017 .

The field of user experience represents an expansion and extension of the field of usability, to include the holistic perspective of how a person feels about using a system. The focus is on pleasure and value as well as on performance. The exact definition, framework, and elements of user experience are still evolving.

User experience of an interactive product or a website is usually measured by a number of methods, including questionnaires, focus groups, and other methods. A freely available questionnaire (available in several languages) is the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ).<ref>cite web|url=http://www.ueq-online.org/|title=UEQ - User Experience Questionnaire|author=|date=|website=www.ueq-online.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001122308/http://www.ueq-online.org/|archivedate=1 October 2017|df=dmy-all</ref> The development and validation of this questionnaire is described in <ref>Laugwitz, B., Schrepp, M. & Held, T. (2008).

 Influences on user experience 

Many factors can influence a user's experience with a system. To address the variety, factors influencing user experience have been classified into three main categories: user's state and previous experience, system properties, and the usage context (situation).<ref>Hassenzahl, M. & Tractinsky, N. 2006, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290500330331 User Experience – a Research Agenda] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020194010/http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290500330331 |date=20 October 2014 . Behaviour and Information Technology, Vol. 25, No. 2, March–April 2006, pp. 91-97</ref> Understanding representative users, working environments, interactions and emotional reactions help in designing the system.

 Momentary emotion or overall user experience 

Single experiences influence the overall user experience:<ref>Forlizzi, J., Battarbee, K. 2004, [http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=hcii Understanding Experience in Interactive Systems] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131195550/http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=hcii |date=31 January 2016 . Proceedings of DIS2004, 1–4 August 2004, Cambridge, USA.</ref> the experience of a key click affects the experience of typing a text message, the experience of typing a message affects the experience of text messaging, and the experience of text messaging affects the overall user experience with the phone. The overall user experience is not simply a sum of smaller interaction experiences, because some experiences are more salient than others. Overall user experience is also influenced by factors outside the actual interaction episode: brand, pricing, friends' opinions, reports in media, etc.

One branch in user experience research focuses on emotions. This includes momentary experiences during interaction: designing affective interaction and evaluating emotions. Another branch is interested in understanding the long-term relation between user experience and product appreciation. The industry sees good overall user experience with a company's products as critical for securing brand loyalty and enhancing the growth of customer base. All temporal levels of user experience (momentary, episodic, and long-term) are important, but the methods to User experience design|design and User experience evaluation|evaluate these levels can be very different.
