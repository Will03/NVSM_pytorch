 Terminology 
The term originally described computers on ARPANET that were hidden, programmed to receive messages but not respond to or acknowledge anything, thus remaining invisible, in the dark.Citation needed|date=November 2018An account detailed how the first online transaction related to drugs transpired in 1971 when students of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University traded marijuana using ARPANET accounts in the former's MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.<ref>Cite book|title=Returning to Interpersonal Dialogue and Understanding Human Communication in the Digital Age|last=Brown Sr.|first=Michael|last2=Hersey|first2=Leigh|publisher=IGI Global|year=2018|isbn=9781522541684|location=Hershey, PA|pages=6</ref>

The term has in later usage incorporated services such as the dark web, which is an overlay network that can be accessed only with specific software, configurations, or authorization, often using non-standard communication protocols and port (computer networking)|ports. Types of dark webs include friend-to-friend networks (usually used for file sharing with a peer-to-peer connection) and internet privacy|privacy networks such as Tor.<ref name="Wood">cite journal

As of|2015, the term "darknet" is often used skunked term|interchangeably with the "dark web" due to the quantity of Tor (anonymity network)#Hidden services|hidden services on Tor (anonymity network)|Tor's darknet. The term is often inaccurately used interchangeably with the Deep Web (search)|deep web due to Tor's history as a platform that could not be search-indexed. Mixing uses of both these terms has been described as inaccurate, with some commentators recommending the terms be used in distinct fashions.<ref name="dark_web">cite web|url=http://www.brightplanet.com/2014/03/clearing-confusion-deep-web-vs-dark-web/|title=Clearing Up Confusion – Deep Web vs. Dark Web|work=BrightPlanet</ref><ref>cite news|last1=NPR Staff|title=Going Dark: The Internet Behind The Internet|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/05/25/315821415/going-dark-the-internet-behind-the-internet|accessdate=29 May 2015|date=25 May 2014</ref><ref>cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=Hacker Lexicon: What Is the Dark Web?|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-whats-dark-web/|accessdate=6 June 2015|date=19 November 2014</ref>

Origins
"Darknet" was coined in the 1970s to designate networks isolated from ARPANET (the government-founded military/academical network which evolved into the Internet), for security purposes.<ref>cite web|url=http://chainhead.io/om-darknet/|title=Om Darknet|accessdate=date|2018-01-15</ref> Darknet addresses could receive data from ARPANET but did not appear in the network lists and would not answer Ping (networking utility)|pings or other inquiries.

The term gained public acceptance following publication of "The Darknet and the Future of Digital distribution|Content Distribution", a 2002 paper by Peter Biddle, Paul England (researcher)|Paul England, Marcus Peinado, and Bryan Willman, four employees of Microsoft who argued the presence of the darknet was the primary hindrance to the development of workable digital rights management (DRM) technologies and made copyright infringement inevitable.<ref>cite conference |url=http://msl1.mit.edu/ESD10/docs/darknet5.pdf |title=The Darknet and the Future of Content Distribution |last1=Biddle |first1=Peter |last2=England |first2=Paul |last3=Peinado |first3=Marcus |last4=Willman |first4=Bryan |publisher=Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation |date=18 November 2002 |conference=ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management |location=Washington, D.C. |format=Portable Document Format|PDF |accessdate=10 October 2012<!-- alternate/backup HTML version: http://www.bearcave.com/misl/misl_tech/msdrm/darknet.htm --></ref> This paper described "darknet" more generally as any type of parallel network that is encrypted or requires a specific protocol to allow a user to connect to it.<ref name=":0" />

Journalist J. D. Lasica, in his 2005 book ''Darknet: Hollywood's War Against the Digital Generation'', described the darknet's reach encompassing file sharing networks.<ref>cite book |last=Lasica |first=J. D. |title=Darknets: Hollywood's War Against the Digital Generation |year=2005 |publisher=J. Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=0-471-68334-5</ref> Subsequently, in 2014, journalist Jamie Bartlett (journalist)|Jamie Bartlett in his book ''The Dark Net'' used the term to describe a range of underground and emergent subcultures, including camgirls, Crypto-anarchism|cryptoanarchists, Darknet market|darknet drug markets, Self-harm|self harm communities, social media racists, and Transhumanism|transhumanists.<ref>cite news|last1=Ian|first1=Burrell|title=The Dark Net: Inside the Digital Underworld by Jamie Bartlett, book review|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-dark-netinside-the-digital-underworld-by-jamie-bartlett-book-review-9696473.html|accessdate=3 June 2015|date=28 August 2014</ref>

Telegram (service)|Telegram because of its features with encryption and after the ban on the territory of different countries, also belongs to the darknet.<ref>Cite web|accessdate=2018-10-29|author=netstalkers|date=2017-09-07|title=ДАРКНЕТ ПЕРЕЕХАЛ В ТЕЛЕГРАМ [netstalkers]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAzVK3xqqvU</ref> It is because of the anonymity that it contains encrypted channels for the sale of prohibited substances, recruiting various organizations and coordinating anti-government actions.<ref>Cite web|accessdate=2018-10-29|title=Опасный Telegram: закрытость мессенждера на руку террористам и наркоторговцам|url=https://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2902947</ref>

 Uses 
Darknets in general may be used for various reasons, such as:
* Computer crime (cracking, file corruption, etc.)
* Protecting dissidents from political reprisal
* File sharing (warez, personal files, pornography, confidential files, illegal or counterfeit software, etc.)
* To better protect the Internet privacy|privacy rights of citizens from targeted surveillance|targeted and mass surveillance|mass surveillance
* Sale of restricted goods on darknet markets
* Whistleblower|Whistleblowing and news leaks
* Purchase or sale of illicit or illegal goods or services<ref>cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/18/hit-men-drugs-and-malicious-teens-the-darknet-is-going-mainstream.html|title=Hit men, drugs and malicious teens: the darknet is going mainstream|first=Harriet|last=Taylor|date=19 May 2016|publisher=</ref>
* Internet censorship circumvention|Circumventing Internet censorship|network censorship and content-control software|content-filtering systems, or bypassing restrictive firewall (computing)|firewall policies<ref>cite web|title=Who uses Tor?|url=https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en|publisher=Tor Project|accessdate=14 May 2017</ref>

Software
All darknets require specific software installed or network configurations made to access them, such as Tor (anonymity network)|Tor, which can be accessed via a customised browser from Vidalia (software)|Vidalia (aka the Tor browser bundle), or alternatively via a proxy server|proxy configured to perform the same function.
