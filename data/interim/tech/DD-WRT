File:Linksys WRT54G.jpg|thumb|DD-WRT was originally designed for the Linksys WRT54G series, but now runs on a variety of routers.

DD-WRT is Linux-based firmware for wireless routers and Wireless access point|access points. Originally designed for the Linksys WRT54G series, it now runs on a wide variety of models. DD-WRT is one of a handful of List of router firmware projects|third-party firmware projects designed to replace manufacturer's original firmware with custom firmware offering additional features or functionality.

Sebastian Gottschall, a.k.a. "BrainSlayer", is the founder and primary maintainer of the DD-WRT project.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.dd-wrt.com/site/content/about|title=About DD-WRT ! www.dd-wrt.com|website=www.dd-wrt.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01</ref>  The letters "DD" in the project name are the Vehicle registration plates of Germany|German license-plate letters for vehicles from Dresden, where the development team lived.<ref name="GPL wiki">Cite web | title=What is DD-WRT? | url=http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/What_is_DD-WRT%3F | website=DD-WRT.com | access-date=2 April 2016</ref>  The remainder of the name was taken from the Linksys WRT54G model router, a home router popular in 2002â€“2004. "WRT", also used by the OpenWrt router firmware project, comes from the generic abbreviation for "Wireless RouTer", which may have been the original Linksys meaning.

Features
Among the standard features common to all versions of DD-WRT are: Computer access control|access control, bandwidth monitoring, quality of service, Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA/WPA2 (personal and enterprise), the iptables firewall, Universal Plug and Play, Wake-on-LAN, Dynamic DNS, AnchorFree VPN, wireless access point configuration, multiple SSIDs, overclocking, Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission power control, and the ability to link routers. A telnet daemon (computing)|daemon is also standard. A few examples of optional features are a wireless distribution system and support for RADIUS and XLink Kai networks. DD-WRT's support for OpenVPN, WireGuard enables both protocols to pass all network traffic through a virtual private network.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.yellowgurl.com/best-dd-wrt-routers-reviews/|title=DD-WRT Products, Pros & Cons|website=yellowgurl|access-date=2017-02-19</ref><ref>Cite web|url=http://www.best-vpn.net/set-up-vpn-on-dd-wrt-router|title=All-in-One Guide to Choose and Set Up VPN On a DD-WRT Router|website=www.best-vpn.net|access-date=2018-02-03</ref>
