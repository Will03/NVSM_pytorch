Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive Computer generated reality|computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual feedback, but may also allow other types of Perception#Types|sensory feedback like Haptic perception|haptic. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical. Augmented reality systems may also be considered a form of VR that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset or through a smartphone or tablet device giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.

Current VR technology most commonly uses virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments, sometimes in combination with physical environments or props, to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to "look around" the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens.

VR systems that include transmission of vibrations and other sensations to the user through a game controller or other devices are known as haptic technology|haptic systems. This tactile information is generally known as force feedback video gaming and training applications.

Etymology and terminology

"Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual" has had the meaning of "being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact" since the mid-1400s.<ref name="etymonline.com">cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=</ref> The term "virtual" has been used in the computer sense of "not physically existing but made to appear by software" since 1959.<ref name="etymonline.com"/> 
In 1938, the French avant-garde playwright  Antonin Artaud described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the theatre as :fr:Réalité virtuelle|"la réalité virtuelle" in a collection of essays, '':fr:Le Théâtre et son double|Le Théâtre et son double''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''The Theater and its Double'',<ref>Antonin Artaud, ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).</ref> is the earliest published use of the term "virtual reality". The term "artificial reality", coined by Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger, has been in use since the 1970s. The term "virtual reality" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by Damien Broderick.

A "cyberspace" is a networked virtual reality.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace|publisher=</ref>

Virtual reality shares some elements with "augmented reality" (or AR).<ref>Myron Krueger. Artificial Reality 2, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1991. ISBN|0-201-52260-8</ref> AR is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their ''real'' surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. Some AR systems use a camera to capture the user's surroundings or some type of display screen which the user looks at (e.g., Microsoft's HoloLens, Magic Leap).

Technology
The VRML|Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML), first introduced in 1994, was intended for the development of "virtual worlds" without dependency on headsets.<ref name="W3 VRML archive">cite web|title=VRML Virtual Reality Modeling Language|url=https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/VRML/|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=20 March 2017</ref> The Web3D consortium was subsequently founded in 1997 for the development of industry standards for web-based 3D graphics.

All modern VR displays are based on technology developed for smartphones including: gyroscopes and motion sensors for tracking head, hand, and body positions; small HD screens for stereoscopic displays; and small, lightweight and fast processors. These components led to relative affordability for independent VR developers, and lead to the 2012 Oculus Rift Kickstarter offering the first independently developed VR headset.<ref name="Wired Magic Leap Apr2016" />

Independent production of VR images and video has increased by the development of omnidirectional cameras, also known as 360-degree cameras or VR cameras, that have the ability to record 360 interactive photography, although at low-resolutions or in highly compressed formats for online streaming of 360 video.<ref name="CNET May 2016">cite web|last1=Orellana|first1=Vanessa Hand|title=10 things I wish I knew before shooting 360 video|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/360-cameras-comparison-video-things-to-know-before-you-buy/|website=CNET|accessdate=20 March 2017|language=en|date=31 May 2016</ref> In contrast, photogrammetry is increasingly used to combine several high-resolution photographs for the creation of detailed 3D objects and environments in VR applications.<ref name="RE7 80.lv">cite web|title=Resident Evil 7: The Use of Photogrammetry for VR|url=https://80.lv/articles/resident-evil-7-the-use-of-photogrammetry-for-vr/|website=80.lv|accessdate=20 March 2017</ref><ref name="otherboard March 2016">cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Leif|title=Forget 360 Videos, Photogrammetric Virtual Reality Is Where It's At - Motherboard|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/forget-360-videos-photogrammetric-virtual-reality-is-where-its-at|website=Motherboard|accessdate=20 March 2017|language=en-us|date=13 March 2016</ref>

 History

File:Sensorama-morton-heilig-virtual-reality-headset.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The Sensorama was designed in the 1960s

Morton Heilig wrote in the 1950s of an "Experience Theatre" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the Sensorama in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a Machine|mechanical device. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the "Telesphere Mask" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as "a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes".<ref>cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017</ref>

Around the same time, Douglas Engelbart used computer screens both as input and output devices. In 1968, Ivan Sutherland, with the help of many students including Bob Sproull, created what was widely considered to be the first head-mounted display (HMD) system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of user interface and realism (arts)|realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple wire-frame model rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles.

In 1979 Eric Howlett developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system. The combined system created a stereoscopic image with a field of view wide enough to create a convincing sense of space. The users of the system have been impressed by the sensation of depth [field of view] in the scene and the corresponding realism. The original LEEP system was redesigned for the NASA Ames Research Center in 1985 for their first virtual reality installation, the VIEW (Virtual Interactive Environment Workstation) by Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher.

By the 1980s the term "virtual reality" was popularized by Jaron Lanier, one of the modern pioneers of the field. Lanier had founded the company VPL Research in 1985. VPL Research has developed several VR devices like the Data Glove, the EyePhone, and the Audio Sphere. VPL licensed the Data Glove technology to Mattel, which used it to make an accessory known as the Power Glove. While the Power Glove was hard to use and not popular, at US$75, it was an early affordable VR device.

Beginning in the 2010s, next-generation commercial tethered headsets were released by Oculus (Rift), HTC (Vive) and Sony (PlayStation VR), setting off a new wave of application development.<ref>cite web|url=http://data-reality.com/comparison-of-best-vr-headsets-morpheus-vs-rift-vs-vive/|title=Comparison of VR headsets: Project Morpheus vs. Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive|website=Data Reality|accessdate=15 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820001906/http://data-reality.com/comparison-of-best-vr-headsets-morpheus-vs-rift-vs-vive/|archivedate=20 August 2015|df=</ref> 3D cinema has been used for sporting events, pornography, fine art, music videos and short films. Since 2015, roller coasters and theme parks have incorporated virtual reality to match visual effects with haptic feedback .<ref name="Wired Magic Leap Apr2016" />

In robotics, virtual reality has been used to control robots in telepresence and telerobotic systems.<ref name="Rosenberg 1992" /><ref name="Rosenberg 1993">Rosenberg, L., "Virtual fixtures as tools to enhance operator performance in telepresence environments," SPIE Manipulator Technology, 1993.</ref> It has been used in robotics development. For example, in experiments that investigate how robots—through virtual articulations—can be applied as an intuitive User interface|human user interface.<ref name=":2">Cite book|title=Advances in Robotics and Virtual Reality|last=Gulrez|first=Tauseef|last2=Hassanien|first2=Aboul Ella|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2012|isbn=9783642233623|location=Berlin|pages=275</ref> Another example is the use of robots that are remotely controlled in dangerous environments such as space. Here, virtual reality not only offers insights into the manipulation and Locomotion in space|locomotion of robotic technology but also shows opportunities for inspection.<ref name=":2" />

When commercially available technology became more widespread, VR festivals began to emerge in the mid-2010s. The first uses of VR in museum settings began in the 1990s, seeing a significant increase in the mid-2010s. Additionally, museums have begun making some of their content virtual reality accessible.<ref>cite web|url=http://mw2016.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/virtual-reality-at-the-british-museum-what-is-the-value-of-virtual-reality-environments-for-learning-by-children-and-young-people-schools-and-families/|title=Virtual reality at the British Museum: What is the value of virtual reality environments for learning by children and young people, schools, and families? – MW2016: Museums and the Web 2016|publisher=</ref><ref>cite web|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/blogs/checklist/extending-the-museum-experience-with-virtual-reality|title=Extending the Museum Experience with Virtual Reality|date=18 March 2016|publisher=</ref>

 Concerns and challenges 
=Health and safety=
There are many health and safety considerations of virtual reality. A number of unwanted symptoms have been caused by prolonged use of virtual reality,<ref>Lawson, B. D. (2014). Motion sickness symptomatology and origins. Handbook of Virtual Environments: Design, Implementation, and Applications, 531-599.</ref> and these may have slowed proliferation of the technology. Most virtual reality systems come with consumer warnings, including: seizures; developmental issues in children; trip-and-fall and collision warnings; discomfort; repetitive stress injury; and interference with medical devices.<ref name="Oculus Rift Warnings">cite web|title=Oculus Rift Health and Safety Notice|url=https://static.oculus.com/documents/310-30023-01_Rift_HealthSafety_English.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2017</ref>  Some users may experience twitches, seizures or blackouts while using VR headsets, even if they do not have a history of epilepsy and have never had blackouts or seizures before. As many as one in 4000 people may experience these symptoms. Since these symptoms are more common among people under the age of 20, children are advised against using VR headsets. Other problems may occur in physical interactions with one's environment. While wearing VR headsets, people quickly lose awareness of their real-world surroundings and may injure themselves by tripping over, or colliding with real-world objects.<ref>cite news |last1=Fagan |first1=Kaylee |title=Here's what happens to your body when you've been in virtual reality for too long |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/virtual-reality-vr-side-effects-2018-3 |accessdate=5 September 2018 |publisher=Business Insider</ref>

VR headsets may regularly cause eye fatigue, as does all screened technology, because people tend to blink less when watching screens, causing their eyes to become more dried out.<ref>cite web |last1=Mukamal |first1=Reena |title=Are Virtual Reality Headsets Safe for Eyes? |url=https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/are-virtual-reality-headsets-safe-eyes |website=American Academy of Ophthalmology |accessdate=11 September 2018</ref> There have been some concerns about VR headsets contributing to myopia, but although VR headsets sit close to the eyes, they may not necessarily contribute to nearsightedness if the focal length of the image being displayed is sufficiently far away.<ref>cite web |last1=Langley |first1=Hugh |title=We need to look more carefully into the long-term effects of VR |url=https://www.wareable.com/vr/vr-long-term-brain-eyes-effects-6674 |website=Wareable.com |accessdate=11 September 2018</ref> 

Virtual reality sickness (also known as cybersickness) occurs when a person's exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms that are similar to motion sickness symptoms.<ref name="Kiryu2007">cite journal |last1=Kiryu |first1=T |last2=So |first2=RH |title=Sensation of presence and cybersickness in applications of virtual reality for advanced rehabilitation |journal=Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation |date=25 September 2007 |volume=4 |pages=34 |doi=10.1186/1743-0003-4-34 |pmid=17894857 |pmc=2117018</ref> The most common symptoms are general discomfort, headache, stomach awareness, nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating, fatigue, drowsiness, disorientation, and apathy.<ref>cite web |last1=Hicks |first1=Jamison S. |last2=Durbin |first2=David B. |title=ARL-TR-5573: A Summary of Simulator Sickness Ratings for U.S. Army Aviation Engineering Simulators |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a551763.pdf |publisher=US Army Research Laboratory |date=June 2011</ref> For example, in 1995, Nintendo released a gaming console known as the Virtual Boy. Worn as a headpiece and connected to a typical controller, the Virtual Boy received much criticism for its negative physical effects, including "dizziness, nausea, and headaches".<ref>Frischling, Bill. "Sideline Play." The Washington Post (1974-Current file): 11. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Washington Post (1877-1995). October 25, 1995. Web. May 24, 2012.</ref> These motion sickness symptoms are caused by a disconnect between what is being seen and what the rest of the body perceives. When the vestibular system, the body's internal balancing system, does not experience the motion that it expects from visual input through the eyes, the user may experience VR sickness. This can also happen if the VR system does not have a high enough frame rate, or if there is a lag between the body's movement and the onscreen visual reaction to it.<ref>cite web |last1=Caddy |first1=Becca |title=Vomit Reality: Why VR makes some of us feel sick and how to make it stop |url=https://www.wareable.com/vr/vr-headset-motion-sickness-solution-777 |website=Wareable.com |accessdate=11 September 2018</ref> Because approximately 25–40% of people experience some kind of VR sickness when using VR machines, companies are actively looking for ways to reduce VR sickness.<ref>cite web |last1=Samit |first1=Jay |title=A Possible Cure for Virtual Reality Motion Sickness |url=http://fortune.com/2018/02/06/virtual-reality-motion-sickness/ |website=Fortune.com |accessdate=11 September 2018</ref>

=Privacy=
The persistent tracking required by all VR systems makes the technology particularly useful for, and vulnerable to, mass surveillance. The expansion of VR will increase the potential and reduce the costs for information gathering of personal actions, movements and responses.<ref name="Wired Magic Leap Apr2016" />

=Conceptual and philosophical concerns=
In addition, there are conceptual and philosophical considerations and implications associated with the use of virtual reality. What the phrase "virtual reality" means or refers to can be ambiguous. Mychilo S. Cline argued in 2005 that through virtual reality techniques will be developed to influence human behavior, interpersonal communication, and cognition.<ref>cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7OxbJWzIaVEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=power+madness+and+immortality&q=|title=Power, Madness, & Immortality: the Future of Virtual Reality |publisher=Virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com |accessdate=2009-10-28|author1=Cline, Mychilo Stephenson|year=2005</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com/index.php?itemid=25&catid=4 |title=The Future of Virtual Reality with Mychilo Cline " Introduction to the Future of Virtual Reality |publisher=Virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com |accessdate=2009-10-28</ref><ref>cite web|title=Power, Madness and Immortality !
