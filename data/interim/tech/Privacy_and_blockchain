A blockchain is a public, shared database that records transactions between two parties.<ref name=":11">Cite web|url=http://scet.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/AIR-2016-Blockchain.pdf|title=BlockChain Technology: Beyond Bitcoin|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=</ref> Specifically, blockchains document and confirm who owns what at a particular time through cryptography.<ref name=":10" /> After a particular transaction is validated and cryptographically verified by other participants, or Node (networking)|nodes in the network, it is then made into a "block" on the blockchain.<ref name=":11" /> A block contains information about when the transaction occurred, previous transactions, and details about the transaction.<ref name=":11" /> Once recorded as a block, transactions are ordered chronologically and cannot be altered or changed.<ref name=":11" /> This technology rose to popularity after the creation of Bitcoin—the first application built on using blockchain technology—and has furthermore catalyzed other cryptocurrencies and applications.<ref>Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e2db/958730353777be3e7b751604d650c4d5aadf.pdf|title=Blockchain - What it is, and a non-financial use case|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=</ref> Due to its nature of decentralization, transactions and data are not verified and owned by one singular, overpowering entity as they are in typical systems.

 Blockchain and protecting privacy 
=Private and public keys=

A key aspect of privacy in blockchains lies in the use of private and public keys. Blockchain systems use asymmetric cryptography to secure transactions between users.<ref name=":8">Cite journal|last=Joshi|first=|date=2018|title=A Survey on Security and Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology|url=|journal=Mathematical Foundations of Computing|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> In these systems, each user has a public and private key.<ref name=":8" /> These keys are random strings of numbers and are cryptographically related to one another.<ref name=":8" /> Although the public and private keys are related to one another, it is mathematically impossible for a user to guess a user's private key from their public key.<ref name=":8" /> This provides an increase in security benefits and protects from potential hackers or malicious users.<ref name=":8" /> Public keys can be shared with other users' in the network, as they do not give any information regarding personal data.<ref name=":8" /> Additionally, each user has an address, which is derived from the public key using a hash function.<ref name=":8" /> These addresses are furthermore used to send and receive assets on the blockchain, such as cryptocurrency.<ref name=":8" /> Because blockchain networks are shared to all participants, users can view past transactions and activity that has occurred on the blockchain.<ref name=":8" /> On the blockchain, senders' and receivers' of past transactions are represented and signified by their addresses.<ref name=":8" /> Due to this, users' identities are not revealed.<ref name=":8" /> Public addresses do not reveal any personal information or identification.<ref name=":8" /> Rather, public addresses act as pseudonymous identities.<ref name=":8" /> This furthermore allows users' to have their identities relatively concealed on the blockchain.<ref name=":8" /> However, it is suggested that users do not use a public address more than once.<ref name=":8" /> This tactic avoids the possibility for a malicious user to trace a particular address' past transactions in attempt to reveal information.<ref name=":8" />  Additionally, private keys are used to protect user identity and security through digital signatures.<ref name=":8" /> Firstly, private keys are used to access funds and personal wallets on the blockchain.<ref name=":8" /> Private keys also add a layer of identity authentication.<ref name=":8" /> When an individual wishes to send money to another user, they must provide a digital signature (which is produced only when provided with the particular private key).<ref name=":8" /> This process protects against potential hackers that aim to pose as certain individuals and use the said-individuals funds.<ref name=":8" />

=Peer-to-peer network=

As previously stated, blockchain technology arose from the creation of Bitcoin.<ref name=":3">Cite journal|last=Crosby et. al|first=Michael|date=2016|title=Blockchain Technology: Beyond Bitcoin|url=|journal=Applied Innovation Review|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> In 2008, a pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto released a paper describing the technology behind the technology.<ref name=":3" /> In his paper, he explained a decentralized network that was characterized by peer-to-peer transactions involving Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies, or electronic money.<ref name=":3" /> In typical transactions carried out today, users put trust into central authorities to securely hold their data and execute transactions.<ref name=":0" /> In large corporations, a large amount of users' personal data is stored on a single device, posing an extreme security risk if an authority's system is hacked, lost, or mishandled.<ref name=":0" /> On the contrary, blockchain technology aims to get rid of this reliance on a central authority.<ref name=":3" /> In order to execute this, blockchain functions in a way where nodes, or devices in a particular blockchain network, can confirm the validity of a transaction rather than a powerful third party.<ref name=":3" /> In this system, transactions between users (such as sending and receiving cryptocurrency) are broadcast to every node in the network.<ref name=":3" /> However, before the transaction is recorded as a block on the blockchain, nodes must ensure that a transaction is valid.<ref name=":3" /> In other words, nodes must check past transactions of the spender to ensure that he/she did not Double-spending|double spend, or spend more funds than they actually own.<ref name=":3" /> After nodes confirm that a block is valid, consensus protocols, such as Proof-of-work system|proof of work and Proof-of-stake|proof of stake, are then deployed by miners.<ref name=":3" /> These protocols allow nodes to reach a state of agreement on the order and amount of transactions.<ref name=":4" /> Once a particular transaction is verified, it is then published on the blockchain as a block (blockchain)|block.<ref name=":2" /> Once a block is created on a blockchain, it cannot be altered or changed.<ref name=":11" /> Through blockchain's decentralized nature and elimination of the need for a central authority, user privacy is increased.<ref name=":0" /> Peer-to-peer networks allow for users to control their data, decreasing the threat of third parties to sell, store, or manipulate personal information.<ref name=":0" />

=Zero-knowledge proofs=

A Zero-knowledge proof|zero-knowledge proof is a consensus protocol where one party proves to another party that a specific set of information (i.e., a transaction is valid) is true.<ref name=":12">Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yunsen|date=|title=Designing Confidentiality-Preserving Blockchain-Based Transaction Processing Systems|url=|journal=International Journal of Accounting Information Systems|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> However, the "prover" do so in a way that does not reveal any specific information about the transaction.<ref name=":12" /> This can be done through complex cryptographic methods.<ref name=":12" /> This method, which has been recently introduced into blockchain systems using Zk-SNARK|zk-snarks, has been enacted to increase privacy in blockchains.<ref name=":12" /> In typical public blockchain systems, a block contains information about a transaction, such as the sender and receivers addresses along with the amount sent.<ref name=":12" /> However, many users are not comfortable with this sense of transparency.<ref name=":12" /> In order to maintain blockchain's nature of decentralization while decreasing transparency, zero-knowledge proofs do not reveal  or share anything about a particular transaction other than the fact that it is valid.<ref name=":12" />

 Private vs. public blockchain privacy 
=Private blockchains=

Private blockchains (also referred to as permissioned blockchains) are different from public blockchains. As stated, public blockchain ledgers are available to any node that wishes to download the network. Common critiques of public blockchains claim that, because everyone has the ability to download a blockchain and look at the history of transactions, there is not much privacy.<ref name=":4" /> However, in private blockchains, nodes must specifically be granted access to participate, view transactions, and deploy consensus protocols.<ref name=":4">Cite journal|last=Guegan|first=Dominique|date=2017|title=Public Blockchain versus Private blockhain|url=|journal=Documents de travail du Centre d’Economie de la Sorbonne|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> Due to the fact that transactions listed on a private blockchain are not public to all, private blockchains ensure an extra layer of privacy.<ref name=":0" />  Since private blockchains have restricted access and nodes must be specifically selected to view and participate in a network, some argue that private blockchains grant more privacy to users.<ref name=":4" /> While private blockchains are being deemed as the most realistic way to adopt blockchain technology into business models in order to maintain a high level of privacy, private blockchains also have cons.<ref name=":3" /> For example, private blockchains delegate specific actors to verify blocks and transactions.<ref name=":6">Cite journal|last=Joshi|first=Archana|date=2018|title=A Survey on Security and Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> Although some argue that this provides efficiency and security, concerns have risen that in nature, private blockchains are not truly decentralized because the verification of transactions and control are put back into the hands of a central entity.<ref name=":6" />

 Use cases for privacy protection 
=Financial transactions=

After Satoshi Nakamoto spurred the creation of blockchain technology through Bitcoin (the most well-known blockchain application), cryptocurrencies rose in popularity and prevalence.<ref name=":3" /> Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that can be used as an alternative form of payment to typical fiat.<ref name=":11" /> In current financial systems, however, there exists many privacy concerns and threats.<ref name=":3" /> A large hurdle in typical data-storage systems is due to centralization.<ref name=":3" /> Currently, when individuals deposit money, a third party intermediary is necessary.<ref name=":3" /> When sending money to another user, individuals must put trust in the fact that a third party will complete this task.<ref name=":3" /> However, blockchain decreases the need for this trust in a central authority; rather, cryptographic functions allow individuals to directly send money to other users.<ref name=":3" /> Because of Bitcoin's widespread recognition and sense of anonymity, criminals have used this to their advantage by purchasing illegal items using Bitcoin.<ref name=":9">Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Bryce|date=2018|title=Blockchain: How It Will Change Your Legal Practice|url=|journal=The Computer and Internet Lawyer|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> Through the use of cryptocurrencies and its pseudonymous keys that signify transactions, illegal purchases are difficult to trace and pin to a singular individual.<ref name=":9" /> Due to the known potential and security that lies in blockchains, many banks are making steps in adopting business models that embrace and utilize the technology.<ref name=":3" />

=Health care records=

In recent years, more than 100 million health care records have been breached.<ref name=":0" /> However, in attempts to combat this prevailing issue of data breaching, attempted solutions often result in inaccessibility of health records.<ref name=":2" /> A large part of this struggle is due to the fact that health providers regularly send data to other providers regarding a specific patient.<ref name=":0" /> Furthermore, this passing of data between providers often results in mishandling data, losing records, or passing on inaccurate and non-updated data.<ref name=":0" /> Additionally, in some cases, only one copy of an updated health record exists; this can result in the loss of important information.<ref name=":2" />  On top of these concerns, health records often contain highly personal information, spanning from patient names, social security numbers, and home addresses.<ref name=":2" /> Overall, it is argued by some that the current system of transferring health information compromises patient privacy in order to make records easy to transfer.<ref name=":2" /> As blockchain technology has expanded and developed in recent years, many have pressed to shift health record storage onto the blockchain.<ref name=":2" /> Rather than having both physical and electronic copies of records, blockchains could allow the shift to solely electronic health records, or EHRs.<ref name=":2" /> Through placing medical records on the blockchain, health information would then be in control of the patient rather than a third party through patient's having a private and public key.<ref name=":2" /> Using this technology, patients could then control who has access to their health records, making transferring information less cumbersome.<ref name=":2" /> Additionally, because blockchain ledgers are immutable, health information could not be deleted or tampered with.<ref name=":2" /> Blockchain transactions, or updated to said health record, would be accompanied by a timestamp, allowing for those with access to have updated information and a clear sense of when particular things occurred in a patient's health history.<ref name=":2" />

=Legal=

Another popular use case that protects the privacy of individuals is notarization of legal documents.<ref name=":3" /> Currently, documents must be verified through a third party, or notary.<ref name=":3" /> This poses roadblocks, as notarization fees can be high.<ref name=":3" /> Additionally, transferring documents takes time and can lead to lost or mishandled information.<ref name=":3" /> Similar to healthcare records, many are pressing for the adoption of blockchain technology in regards to the storage legal documents.<ref name=":3" /> This way, documents cannot be tampered with and can be easily accessed by those who are granted permission to such documents.<ref name=":3" /> As a result, individual information is then protected from possible stolen information and mishandling of private information.<ref name=":9" /> Another potential adoption of blockchain technology is the execution of legal contracts using smart contracts.<ref name=":9" /> Smart contracts are a popular application of the blockchain network in which nodes automatically execute terms of a contract.<ref name=":9" /> By using smart contracts, people will no longer have to rely on a third party to manage contracts, allowing for an increase in privacy regarding personal information.<ref name=":9" />

 Legality of blockchain and privacy 
=GDPR=

With the recent adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, questions have arisen regarding blockchain's compliance with the act.<ref name=":5">Cite journal|last=Berberich|first=M.|date=|title=Blockchain Technology and the GDPR: How to Reconcile Privacy and Distributed Ledgers|url=|journal=European Data Protection Law Review|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> In short, GDPR is a piece of data privacy legislation that was enacted to protect EU citizens from data breaches.<ref name=":5" /> This piece of legislation applies to those who both process data in the EU as well as those who process data outside the EU for people in the EU.<ref name=":5" /> However, personal data (as defined by the GDPR) is "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person".<ref name=":5" /> Because identities on a blockchain are associated with an individual's public and private key, it comes in question whether or not this falls under the category of personal data, since public and private keys enable complete pseudonymity and are not necessarily connected to a specific identity.<ref name=":5" /> Additionally, a key part of the GDPR lies in a citizen's right to be forgotten, otherwise known as data erasure.<ref name=":5" /> This piece of the GDPR allows individuals to request that data associated with them to be erased if it is no longer relevant along with other conditions.<ref name=":5" /> Due to the blockchain's nature of immutability, there exists potential complications if an individual who made transactions on the blockchain requests their data to be deleted.<ref name=":5" /> Additionally, another roadblock lies in the fact that once a block is verified on the blockchain, it is immutable, or impossible to delete.<ref name=":3" />

=IRS=

Because cryptocurrency prices fluctuate, many treat the purchase of crypto as an investment. By purchasing these coins at particular prices, buyers hope that they can later sell them at a higher price, furthermore making a profit. However, the Internal Revenue Service|IRS, or International Revenue Service, are currently facing struggles due to the fact that many people do not include revenue made by cryptocurrencies in their income reports.<ref name=":13">Cite journal|last=Heroux|first=Mark|date=October 2018|title=Cryptocurrency: Compliance challenges and IRS enforcement|url=|journal=Tax Adviser|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> In response to these concerns, the IRS issued a notice, announcing that people ''must'' apply general tax principles to cryptocurrency and treat the purchase of cryptocurrency as an investment or stock.<ref name=":13" /> Furthermore, the IRS has enacted that, if people fail to report their income from cryptocurrency, they could be subject to civil penalties and fines.<ref name=":13" /> In attempts to strictly enforce these rules and avoid potential tax fraud, the IRS has called on Coinbase to report users that have sent or received more than $20,000 worth of cryptocurrency in a singular year.<ref name=":13" /> However, the nature of blockchain technology makes these enforcements rather difficult.<ref name=":13" /> Because blockchains are decentralized, singular, all-powerful entities cannot keep track of purchases and activity of a user.<ref name=":13" /> Additionally, pseudonymous addresses make it difficult to tie identities with users, ultimately being a perfect outlet for people to launder money.<ref name=":13" />

=Blockchain Alliance=

Because virtual currencies and the blockchain's protection of identity has proven to be a hub for criminal purchases and activity, the FBI and Justice Department created the Blockchain Alliance.<ref name=":9" /> This team, which is made up of law enforcement agencies, aims to identify and enforce legal restrictions on the blockchain to combat such activity through open dialogue on a private-public forum.<ref name=":9" /> This allows such leaders in the law enforcement industry to work together to fight against these illegal exploitations of the technology.<ref name=":9" /> Examples of criminal activity on the blockchain include hacking cryptocurrency wallets and stealing funds.<ref name=":10">Cite journal|last=Wieczner|first=Jen|date=2017|title=The 21St-Century Bank Robbery|url=|journal=Fortune |volume=176 |issue=3 |pages=34-41|via=</ref> However, since user identities are not tied to public addresses, it is extremely hard to locate and identify particular criminals and robbers.<ref name=":10" />

=Fair Information Practices=

Importantly, blockchain has been acknowledged as a way to solve FTC fair information practice|Fair Information Practices, which are a set of principles relating to privacy practices and concerns for users in modern technology.<ref name=":0" /> Specifically, blockchain transactions allow for users to control their data through private and public keys, allowing them to own it themselves completely.<ref name=":0" /> This way, third-party intermediaries are not allowed to misuse and obtain data in unsuspecting ways.<ref name=":0" /> Additionally, if personal data is stored on the blockchain, owners of such data are able to control when and how a third party can access said data. In blockchains, ledgers automatically include an audit trail. This ensures that transactions accurate.<ref name=":0" />

 Concerns regarding blockchain privacy 
=Transparency=

Although many push for the adoption of blockchain technology because it allows users to control their own data and get rid of third parties, some believe that certain characteristics of this technology infringe on user privacy.<ref name=":1">Cite journal|last=De Filippi|first=Primavera|date=2018|title=The Interplay between Decentralization and Privacy: The Case of Blockchain Technologies|url=|journal=Journal of Peer Production|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> Because blockchains are decentralized and allow for any node to access transactions, events and actions of users are completely transparent.<ref name=":1" /> Additionally, skeptics worry that malicious users can trace Public-key cryptography|public keys and addresses (which is a way to represent sender and receivers, although made up of random numbers and letters) back to specific users. If this were the case, then a user's transaction history would be completely viewable and accessible to anyone, resulting in what some consider to be a lack of privacy.<ref name=":1" />

=Decentralization=

Another concern lies in the fact that, due to blockchain's decentralized nature, a central authority is not surveilling for malicious users and attacks.<ref name=":1" /> This creates a concern that users might be able to hack the system anonymously and escape unscathed.<ref name=":1" /> Because public blockchains are not controlled by an all-powerful third party, a false transaction enacted by a hacker that has a user's private key cannot be stopped.<ref name=":10" /> Additionally, because blockchain ledgers are shared and immutable, it is not possible to simply undo or reverse a malicious transaction.<ref name=":10" />

=Private keys=

As previously stated, private keys essentially provide a way to prove ownership and control of cryptocurrency.<ref name=":10" /> If someone simply has access to another user's private key, he/she are able to access and spend these funds.<ref name=":10" /> Because private keys are crucial to accessing and protecting assets on the blockchain, users must store the private key safely.<ref name=":10" /> Many have run into problems with this, as storing it on a computer, flashdrive, or phone can propose potential security risks if stolen or hacked.<ref name=":10" /> Additionally, if a device is misplaced or lost that contains a user's private key, they no longer have access to their cryptocurrency.<ref name=":10" /> This creates issues of storage, as placing physical place (such as on a piece of paper in a lock) can be stolen and placing it online can be hacked or lost.<ref name=":10" />

 Cases of privacy failure 
=MtGox=

In 2014, Mt. Gox|MtGox was the world's largest Bitcoin exchange at the time located in Tokyo, Japan.<ref name=":7">Cite journal|last=Li|first=X|date=2017|title=A survey on the security of blockchain systems|url=|journal=Future Generation of Computer Systems|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> However, the exchange suffered from the largest blockchain hack of all time.<ref name=":7" /> During the year of 2014, MtGox held an enormous portion of the Bitcoin market, accounting for more than half of the cryptocurrency at the time.<ref name=":7" /> Throughout the month of February, hackers infiltrated the exchange, stealing what amounted to 450 million dollars in Bitcoin.<ref name=":7" /> Many in the blockchain community were shocked at the time, as blockchain technology is often associated with security and this was the first major hack to occur in the space.<ref name=":10" /> Although analysts were able to track the public address of the robbers by looking at the public record of transactions, the person (or people) who committed the heist were not identified.<ref name=":10" /> This is a direct result of the pseudonymity of blockchain transactions.<ref name=":10" />

=DAO Hack=

While blockchain technology is anticipated to solve privacy issues such as data breaching, tampering, and other threats, it is not immune to malicious attacks. In 2016, the The DAO (organization)|DAO opened up a funding window for a particular project.<ref name=":0" /> Within this period of time, the system was hacked, resulting in the loss of what was (at the time) 3.6 million from the Ether fund.<ref name=":0" /> However, due to the ever-changing price of cryptocurrencies, the amount stolen has been estimated at a whopping 64-100 million dollars.<ref name=":0" />

=Coinbase=

Coinbase—the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to store, buy, and sell cryptocurrency—has faced a multitude of hacks since its founding in 2012.<ref name=":10" /> Users have reported that due to its log-in process that verifies login  through personal phone numbers and email addresses, hackers have targeted the numbers and emails of well-known individuals and CEOS in the blockchain space.<ref name=":10" /> Hackers then used the emails of these individuals to change their verification number, consequently stealing thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency from Coinbase user wallets.<ref name=":10" />
