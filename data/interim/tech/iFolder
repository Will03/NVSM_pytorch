iFolder is an open-source software|open-source application, developed by Novell, Inc., intended to allow cross-platform file sharing across computer networks.

iFolder operates on the concept of shared Directory (file systems)|folders, where a folder is marked as shared and the contents of the folder are then synchronized to other computers over a network, either directly between computers in a peer-to-peer fashion or through a server.  This is intended to allow a single user to File synchronization|synchronize files between different computers (for example between a work computer and a home computer) or share files with other users (for example a group of people who are collaborating on a project).

The core of the iFolder is actually a project called Simias (software)|Simias.  It is Simias which actually monitors files for changes, synchronizes these changes and controls the access permissions on folders.  The actual iFolder clients (including a graphical desktop client and a web client) are developed as separate programs that communicate with the Simias back-end.
