The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is an international learned society for computing. It was founded in 1947, and is the world's largest scientific and educational computing society.<ref>cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/20613.html |title=Indiana University Media Relations |publisher=indiana.edu |accessdate=October 10, 2012 </ref> The ACM is a nonprofit organization|non-profit professional membership group,<ref>cite web|url=https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/pub78Search.do?ein1=&names=%22association+for+computing+machinery%22&city=&state=All...&country=US&deductibility=all&dispatchMethod=searchCharities&submitName=Search |title=ACM 501(c)3 Status as a group |publisher=irs.gov |accessdate=October 1, 2012</ref> with more than 100,000 members as of|2011|lc=y.  Its headquarters are in New York City.<ref>cite web |title=Contact Information |url=https://www.acm.org/about-acm/contact-us |website=www.acm.org |language=en</ref>

The ACM is an umbrella organization for academic and scholarly interests in computer science. Its motto is "Advancing Computing as a Science & Profession".

History
The ACM was founded in 1947 under the name ''Eastern Association for Computing Machinery'', which was changed the following year to the Association for Computing Machinery.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-history|title=ACM History|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06</ref>

Activities

ACM is organized into over 171 local chapters and 37 Special Interest Groups (SIGs), through which it conducts most of its activities. Additionally, there are over 500 college and university chapters. The first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

Many of the SIGs, such as ACM SIGGRAPH|SIGGRAPH, SIGPLAN, SIGCSE and SIGCOMM, sponsor regular conferences, which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting innovations in certain fields. The groups also publish a large number of specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters.

ACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between Garry Kasparov and the IBM Deep Blue computer.

Although ''Communications'' no longer publishes primary research, and is not considered a prestigious venue, many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages.

ACM has made almost all of its publications available to paid subscribers online at its #Digital Library|Digital Library and also has a ACM Guide to Computing Literature|Guide to Computing Literature. Individual members additionally have access to Safari Books Online and Books24x7. ACM also offers insurance, online courses, and other services to its members.

In 1997, ACM Press published ''Wizards and Their Wonders: Portraits in Computing'' (ISBN|0897919602), written by Christopher Morgan, with new photographs by Louis Fabian Bachrach, Jr.|Louis Fabian Bachrach. The book is a collection of historic and current portrait photographs of figures from the computer industry.

Portal and Digital Libraryanchor|Portalanchor|Digital Library
The ACM Portal is an online service of the ACM.<ref name=portal>cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/|title=ACM Digital Library|work=acm.org</ref> 
Its core are two main sections: ACM Digital Library and the ACM Guide to Computing Literature.<ref>[http://www.libs.uga.edu/research/subject/computer-science The University of Georgia Guide to Online Resources]</ref>

The ACM Digital Library is the full-text collection of all articles published by the ACM in its articles, magazines and conference proceedings. The Guide is a bibliography in computing with over one million entries.<ref name=portal/>
The ACM Digital Library contains a comprehensive archive starting in the 1950s of the organization's journals, magazines, newsletters and conference proceedings. Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest. There is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature. This secondary database is a rich discovery service known as The ACM Guide to Computing Literature.

ACM adopted a hybrid Open access|Open Access (OA) publishing model in 2013. Authors who do not choose to pay the OA fee must grant ACM publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement.<ref>cite web|url=http://authors.acm.org/ | title=ACM Author Rights |publisher=Acm.org</ref>

ACM was a "green" publisher before the term was invented. Authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the ACM Digital Library's permanently maintained Version of Record.

All metadata in the Digital Library is open to the world, including abstracts, linked references and citing works, citation and usage statistics, as well as all functionality and services. Other than the free articles, the full-texts are accessed by subscription.

There is also a mounting challenge to the ACM's publication practices coming from the Open access (publishing)|open access movement. Some authors see a centralized peer&ndash;review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like arXiv. Other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online, such as Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), Journal of Machine Learning Research|Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) and the Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology.

Membership grades
In addition to student and regular members, ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and "demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers".<ref>cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/membership/membership/senior_members/ |title=ACM Senior Members–An Overview |publisher=Acm.org |access-date=November 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118200303/http://www.acm.org/membership/membership/senior_members/ |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all </ref>

=Fellows=
main|ACM Fellow|List of Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery
The ACM Fellows Program was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1993 "to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM." Since March 2015, there are about 958 Fellows<ref>cite web|url=http://awards.acm.org/fellow/all.cfm |title=List of ACM Fellows |publisher=Awards.acm.org |accessdate=March 3, 2015</ref> out of about 75,000 professional members.

=Distinguished Members=
In 2006, ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades, one which was called Distinguished Members. Distinguished Members (Distinguished Engineers, Distinguished Scientists, and Distinguished Educators) have at least 15 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership and "have made a significant impact on the computing field". Note that in 2006 when the Distinguished Members first came out, one of the three levels was called "Distinguished Member" and was changed about two years later to "Distinguished Educator". Those who already had the Distinguished Member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles.

=Senior Members=
Also in 2006, ACM began recognizing Senior Members. Senior Members have ten or more years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership.

=Distinguished Speakers=
While not technically a membership grade, the ACM recognizes distinguished speakers on topics in computer science. A distinguished speaker is appointed for a three-year period. There are usually about 125 current distinguished speakers. The ACM website describes these people as 'Renowned International Thought Leaders'.<ref>cite web|url = https://speakers.acm.org/ |title = Homepage|website = ACM Distinguished Speakers|publisher = Association for Computing Machinery</ref> The distinguished speaker program is overseen by a committee <ref>cite web|url = https://speakers.acm.org/committee| title = ACM Speakers Committee|website = ACM Distinguished Speakers|publisher = Association for Computing Machinery</ref>

Norman E. Gibbs served as the president of the ACM.

Cooperation
ACM's primary partner has been the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS), which is the largest subgroup of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical computer science, but there is considerable overlap with ACM's agenda. They have many joint activities including conferences, publications and awards.<ref>cite web|title=ACM / IEEE-CS Cooperation — Association for Computing Machinery|url=http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101141809/http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop|archive-date=January 1, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all</ref> ACM and its SIGs co-sponsor about 20 conferences each year with IEEE-CS and other parts of IEEE.<ref>cite web|title=ACM / IEEE-CS Jointly Sponsored Conferences —Association for Computing Machinery|url=http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/conferences|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101141814/http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/conferences|archive-date=January 1, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all</ref> Eckert-Mauchly Award and Ken Kennedy Award, both major awards in computer science, are given jointly by ACM and the IEEE-CS.<ref>cite web|title=ACM / IEEE-CS Joint Awards — Association for Computing Machinery|url=http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/awards|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143733/http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/awards|archive-date=April 6, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all</ref> They occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula.<ref>cite web |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2534860 |title=Computer Science Curricula 2013: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science|author1 = Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula|author2 = Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)|author3 = IEEE Computer Society|authorlink3=IEEE Computer Society</ref>
