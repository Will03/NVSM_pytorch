Overview
Hacktivist activities span many political ideals and issues. Freenet, a peer-to-peer platform for censorship-resistant communication, is a prime example of translating political thought (freedom of speech|anybody should be able to speak freely) into code. Hacking as a form of activism can be carried out through a network of activists, such as Anonymous and WikiLeaks, or through a singular activist, working in collaboration toward a common goals without an overarching authority figure.<ref>cite journal |last=Milone |first=Mark |year=2002 |title=Hactivism: Securing the National Infrastructure |journal=The Business Lawyer |volume=58 |pages=383–413 |jstor=40688127 </ref>

"Hacktivism" is a controversial term with several meanings. The word was coined to characterize electronic direct action as working toward social change by combining computer programming|programming skills with critical thinking. But just as ''hack'' can sometimes mean cyber crime, ''hacktivism'' can be used to mean activism that is malicious, destructive, and undermining the computer security|security of the Internet as a technology|technical, economics|economic, and political platform.<ref>Peter Krapp, [http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/noise-channels "Noise Channels: Glitch and Error in Digital Culture"] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523062615/http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/noise-channels |date=2013-05-23 .

Controversy
Depending on who is using the term, hacktivism can be a politically motivated technology hack (computer security)|hack, a constructive form of anarchism|anarchic civil disobedience, or an undefined anti-systemic gesture.<ref>Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2010|title=Hactivism's New Face: Are Your Company's Enemies Embracing New Tactics?|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=bcab9318-79b2-42be-afc2-6e00f7cb80a9%40sessionmgr102&vid=1&hid=127|journal=Security Directors Report|volume=10|pages=2–4|via=EBSCO Host</ref> It can signal anti-capitalism|anticapitalist or political protest; it can denote anti-spam (electronic)|spam activists, security experts, or Open-source model|open source advocates.<ref>Cite journal|last=Ragan|first=Steve|year=2014|title=Hactivism Struggles With a Slippery Slope as Anonymous Targets Children's Hospital|url=|journal=CSO Magazine|volume=13|pages=|via=EBSCO Host</ref>

Forms and methods
Self-proclaimed "Hactivists" often work anonymously, sometimes operating in groups while other times operating as a lone-wolf with several cyber-personas all corresponding to one activist<ref name=":2" /> within the cyberactivism umbrella that has been gaining public interest and power in pop-culture. Hactivists generally operate under apolitical ideals and express uninhibited ideas or abuse without being scrutinized by society while representing or defending them publicly under an anonymous identity giving them a sense of power in the cyberactivism community.

In order to carry out their operations, hacktivists might create new tools; or integrate or use a variety of software tools readily available on the Internet. One class of hacktivist activities includes increasing the accessibility of others to take politically motivated action online.

Perhaps the most prolific and well known hacktivist group, Anonymous (group)|Anonymous has been prominent and prevalent in many major online hacks over the past decade.

Since declaring war on ISIS, Anonymous since identified several Twitter accounts associated with the movement in order to stop the distribution of ISIS propaganda.

Anonymous has also been involved with the Black Lives Matter movement. Early in July 2015, there was a rumor circulating that Anonymous was calling for a Day of Rage  protests in retaliation for the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, which would entail violent protests and riots. This rumor was based off a video that was not posted with the official Anonymous YouTube account. None of the Twitter accounts associated with Anonymous had tweeted anything in relation to a Day of Rage, and the rumors were identical to past rumors that had circulated in 2014 following the death of Mike Brown.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/2016/07/11/anonymous-day-of-rage-protests-2016/|title=Anonymous 'Day of Rage' Protests|last=LaCapria|first=Kim|website=snopes|access-date=2016-10-23</ref> Instead, on July 15, a Twitter account associated with Anonymous posted a series of tweets calling for a day of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The Twitter account used the hashtag "#FridayofSolidarity" to coordinate protests across the nation, and emphasized the fact that the Friday of Solidarity was intended for peaceful protests. The account also stated that the group was unaware of any Day of Rage plans.<ref>Cite news|url=http://sfist.com/2016/07/15/black_lives_matter_protests_happeni.php|title=Black Lives Matter Protests Happening Today At SF's Civic Center And Downtown Oakland|newspaper=SFist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718014246/http://sfist.com/2016/07/15/black_lives_matter_protests_happeni.php|archivedate=2016-07-18|df=</ref>

WikiLeaks is also notable for its leak of over 20,000 confidential emails and 8,000 file attachments from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), on July 22, 2016.

=LulzSec=

In May 2011, five members of Anonymous formed the hacktivist group LulzSec|Lulz Security, otherwise known as LulzSec. LulzSec's name originated from the conjunction of the internet slang term "lulz", meaning laughs, and "sec", meaning security.<ref name=":0">Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/lulzsec-hacking-fbi-jail|title=LulzSec: what they did, who they were and how they were caught|last=Arthur|first=Charles|date=2013-05-16|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014142622/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/lulzsec-hacking-fbi-jail|archivedate=2016-10-14|df=</ref> The group members used specific handles to identify themselves on Internet Relay Channels, the most notable being:  "Sabu," "Kayla," "T-Flow," "Topiary," "AVUnit," and "Pwnsauce." Though the members of LulzSec would spend up to 20 hours a day in communication, they did not know one another personally, nor did they share personal information. For example, once the members' identities were revealed, "T-Flow" was revealed to be 15 years old. Other members, on the basis of his advanced coding ability, thought he was around 30 years old.<ref>Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/lulzsec-reunited-anonymous-hackers-meet-first-time-real-life-1467870|title=LulzSec Reunited: Anonymous Hackers Meet for the First Time in Real Life|last=Gilbert|first=David|date=2014-09-30|newspaper=International Business Times UK|access-date=2016-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924184722/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/lulzsec-reunited-anonymous-hackers-meet-first-time-real-life-1467870|archivedate=2016-09-24|df=</ref>

One of the first notable targets that LulzSec pursued was HBGary, which was performed in response to a claim made by the technology security company that it had identified members of Anonymous. Following this, the members of LulzSec targeted an array of companies and entities, including but not limited to: Fox Television Network|Fox Television, Tribune Media|Tribune Company, PBS, Sony, Nintendo, and the Senate.gov website. The targeting of these entities typically involved gaining access to and downloading confidential user information, or defacing the website at hand.<ref>United States of America v. Hector Monsegur. Southern District Court of New York. 23 May 2014. ''Cryptome.org''. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Oct. 2016.</ref>  Though the attacks carried out by LulzSec were not as strongly political as those typical of WikiLeaks or Anonymous, they shared similar sentiments for the freedom of information.

The group's first attack that garnered significant government attention was in 2011, when they collectively took down a website of the FBI. Following the incident, the leader of LulzSec, "Sabu," was identified as Hector Monsegur|Hector Xavier Monsegur by the FBI, and he was the first of the group to be arrested. Immediately following his arrest, Monsegur admitted to criminal activity. He then began his cooperation with the US government, helping FBI authorities to arrest 8 of his co-conspirators, prevent 300 potential cyber attacks, and helped to identify vulnerabilities in existing computer systems. In August 2011, Monsegur pleaded guilty to "computer hacking conspiracy, computer hacking, computer hacking in furtherance of fraud, conspiracy to commit access device fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and aggravated identity theft pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government." He served a total of one year and seven months and was charged a $1,200 fine.<ref name=":1">Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/leading-member-of-the-international-cyber-criminal-group-lulzsec-sentenced-in-manhattan-federal-court|title=Leading Member of the International Cyber Criminal Group LulzSec Sentenced in Manhattan Federal Court|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2016-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119182337/https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/leading-member-of-the-international-cyber-criminal-group-lulzsec-sentenced-in-manhattan-federal-court|archivedate=2016-11-19|df=</ref>

= Culture jamming =
Unreferenced section|date=December 2018
''Culture jamming'' is the practice of subverting and criticizing political messages as well as media culture with the aim of challenging the status quo. It is often targeted toward subliminal thought processes taking place in the viewers with the goal of raising awareness as well as causing a paradigm shift. Culture jamming takes many forms including billboard hacking, broadcast signal intrusion, ad-hoc art performances, memes, and artivism.

The term "culture jamming" was first coined in 1984 by American musician Don Joyce (musician)|Donald Joyce of the band Negativland. However, some speculation remains as to when the practice of culture jamming first began. Social researcher Vince Carducci believes culture jamming can be traced back to the 1950s with European social activist group Situationist International. Author and cultural critic Mark Dery believes medieval carnival is the earliest form of culture jamming as a way to subvert the social hierarchy at the time.

Culture jamming is sometimes confused with acts of vandalism. However, unlike culture jamming, the main goal of vandalism is to cause destruction with any political themes being of lesser importance. Artivism usually has the most questionable nature as a form of culture jamming because defacement of property is usually involved.

''Media hacking'' refers to the usage of various electronic media in an innovative or otherwise abnormal fashion for the purpose of conveying a message to as large a number of people as possible, primarily achieved via the World Wide Web.<ref>cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.seanbohan.com/?p=6 | title = Media Hacking | publisher = SeanBohan.com | author = Bohan, S. | accessdate = February 9, 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929114342/http://www.seanbohan.com/?p=6 | archivedate = September 29, 2007 | df =  </ref><ref>cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.meskelsquare.com/archives/2005/11/hacking_baby_cheetahs_and_hung.html | title = Hacking Baby Cheetahs and Hunger Strikes | publisher = Meskel Square | author = Heavens, A. | accessdate = February 9, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108145039/http://www.meskelsquare.com/archives/2005/11/hacking_baby_cheetahs_and_hung.html | archivedate = November 8, 2006 | df =  </ref> A popular and effective means of media hacking is posting on a blog, as one is usually controlled by one or more independent individuals, uninfluenced by outside parties. The concept of social bookmarking, as well as Web-based Internet forums, may cause such a message to be seen by users of other sites as well, increasing its total reach.

Media hacking is commonly employed for political purposes, by both political parties and dissident|political dissidents. A good example of this is the 2008 US Election, in which both the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic and Republican Party (United States)|Republican parties used a wide variety of different media in order to convey relevant messages to an increasingly Internet-oriented audience.<ref>cite web |author=Peter Kafka |url=http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/6/presidential_debates_come_to_twitter_how_to_follow_along |title=Obama, McCain Debate Via Twitter: How To Follow Along* |publisher=Alleyinsider.com |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2011-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207082105/http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/6/presidential_debates_come_to_twitter_how_to_follow_along |archivedate=2009-02-07 |df= </ref> At the same time, political dissidents used blogs and other social media like Twitter in order to reply on an individual basis to the presidential candidates. In particular, sites like Twitter are proving important means in gauging popular support for the candidates, though the site is often used for dissident purposes rather than a show of positive support.<ref>cite web |url=http://goodgearguide.com.au/index.php/id;1823349553 |title=Twitter backlash over McCain campaign 'suspension' |publisher=Good Gear Guide |date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2011-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201043312/http://goodgearguide.com.au/index.php/id |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= </ref>

Mobile technology has also become subject to media hacking for political purposes. Short message service|SMS has been widely used by political dissidents as a means of quickly and effectively organising smart mobs for political action. This has been most effective in the Philippines, where SMS media hacking has twice had a significant impact on whether or not the country's Presidents are elected or removed from office.<ref>cite web |author=August 22nd, 2006 by Howard Rheingold |url=http://www.smartmobs.com/2006/08/22/wikipedia-on-sms-political-impacts/ |title=Blog Archive » Wikipedia on SMS, political impacts |publisher=Smart Mobs |date=2006-08-22 |accessdate=2011-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613113554/http://www.smartmobs.com/2006/08/22/wikipedia-on-sms-political-impacts/ |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= </ref>

=Reality hacking=
''Reality hacking'' is any phenomenon that emerges from the nonviolent use of illegal or legally ambiguous Digital data|digital tools in pursuit of politically, socially, or culture jamming|culturally subversive ends. These tools include website defacements, URL redirections, denial-of-service attacks, information theft, web-site parodies, virtual sit-ins, and virtual sabotage.Citation needed|date=January 2010

Art movements such as Fluxus and Happenings in the 1970s created a climate of receptibility in regard to loose-knit organizations and group activities where spontaneity, a modern primitive|return to primitivist behavior, and an ethics where activities and artivism|socially engaged art practices became tantamount to aesthetic concerns.Clarify | date = January 2010

The conflation of these two histories in the mid-to-late 1990s Citation needed|date=January 2010 resulted in cross-overs between virtual sit-ins, electronic civil disobedience, denial-of-service attacks, as well as mass protests in relation to groups like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The rise of collectivies, net.art groups, and those concerned with the fluid interchange of technology and real life (reality)|real life (often from an environmental concern) gave birth to the practice of "reality hacking".

Reality hacking relies on tweaking the everyday communications most easily available to individuals with the purpose of awakening the political and social connectedness|community conscience of the larger population. The term first came into use among New York and San Francisco artists, but has since been adopted by a school of thought|school of political activists centered around culture jamming.

In fiction
The 1999 science fiction-action film ''The Matrix'', among others, popularized the simulation hypothesis — the suggestion that reality is in fact a simulation of which those affected by the simulants are generally unaware. In this context, "reality hacking" is reading and understanding the code which represents the activity of the simulated reality environment (such as Matrix digital rain) and also modifying it in order to bend the laws of physics or otherwise modify the simulated reality.

Reality hacking as a mystical practice is explored in the Goth subculture|Gothic-Punk aesthetics-inspired White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf urban fantasy role-playing game ''Mage: The Ascension''. In this game, the Reality Coders (also known as Reality Hackers or Reality Crackers) are a faction within the Virtual Adepts, a secret society of mages whose Magic (fantasy)|magick revolves around Digital data|digital technology. They are dedicated to bringing the benefits of cyberspace to Real life|real space. To do this, they had to identify, for lack of a better term, the "source code" that allows our Universe to function. And that is what they have been doing ever since. Coders infiltrated a number of levels of society in order to gather the greatest compilation of knowledge ever seen. One of the Coders' more overt agendas is to acclimate the masses to the world that is to come. They spread Virtual Adept ideas through video games and a whole spate of "reality shows" that mimic virtual reality far more than "real" reality. The Reality Coders consider themselves the future of the Virtual Adepts, creating a world in the image of visionaries like Grant Morrison or Terence McKenna.Citation needed|date=July 2011

In a location-based game (also known as a pervasive game), reality hacking refers to tapping into phenomena that exist in the real world, and tying them into the game story universe.<ref>cite book |doi=10.1145/1501750.1501803 |chapter=The art of game-mastering pervasive games |title=Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference in Advances on Computer Entertainment Technology - ACE '08 |pages=224–31 |year=2008 |last1=Jonsson |first1=Staffan |last2=Waern |first2=Annika |isbn=978-1-60558-393-8 </ref>

=Academic interpretations =
There have been various academic approaches to deal with hacktivism and urban hacking. In 2010, Günther Friesinger, Johannes Grenzfurthner and Thomas Ballhausen published an entire reader dedicated to the subject. They state: "Urban spaces became battlefields, signifiers have been invaded, new structures have been established: Netculture replaced counterculture in most parts and also focused on the everchanging environments of the modern city. Important questions have been brought up to date and reasked, taking current positions and discourses into account. The major question still remains, namely how to create culturally based resistance under the influence of capitalistic pressure and conservative politics."<ref>cite web|title=Urban Hacking: Cultural Jamming Strategies in the Risky Spaces of Modernity|url=https://www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-1536-4/urban-hacking/|publisher=Transcript|accessdate=15 May 2018</ref>
