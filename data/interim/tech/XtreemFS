XtreemFS is an object-based file system|object-based, distributed file system for wide area networks.<ref name="arch">F. Hupfeld, T. Cortes, B. Kolbeck, E. Focht, M. Hess, J. Malo, J. Marti, J. Stender, E. Cesario. [http://www.xtreemfs.org/publications/vldb_dmg_07_camera_ready.pdf "XtreemFS - a case for object-based storage in Grid data management"]. VLDB Workshop on Data Management in Grids. In: Proceedings of 33rd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) Workshops, 2007.</ref> XtreemFS' outstanding feature is full (all components) and real (all failure scenarios, including CAP theorem|network partitions) Fault-tolerant system|fault tolerance, while maintaining POSIX file system semantics. Fault-tolerance is achieved by using Paxos (computer science)|Paxos-based lease (computer science)|lease negotiation algorithms and is used to replicate files and metadata. Transport Layer Security|SSL and X.509#Certificates|X.509 certificates support make XtreemFS usable over public networks.

XtreemFS has been under development since early 2007. A first public release was made in August 2008. XtreemFS 1.0 was released in August 2009. The 1.0 release includes support for read-only replication with failover, data center replica maps, parallel reads and writes, and a native Windows client. The 1.1 added automatic on-close replication and POSIX advisory locks. In mid-2011, release 1.3 added read/write replication for files. Version 1.4 underwent extensive testing and is considered production-quality. An improved Hadoop integration and support for SSDs was added in version 1.5.

XtreemFS is funded by the European Commission's Information Society Technologies|IST programme.

The original XtreemFS team founded [http://www.quobyte.com Quobyte] Inc. in 2013. Quobyte offers a professional storage system as a commercial product.
