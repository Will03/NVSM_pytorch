Distributed anonymous storage system

The Project's early work focused on an anonymous storage system, Free Haven, which was designed to ensure the privacy and security of both readers and publishers.<ref name="hansen">cite conference | last=Hansen | first=J.

Work with Tor
main article|Tor (anonymity network)
Tor was developed to by the US Naval Research Laboratory and the Free Haven Project to secure government communications, with initial funding from the US Office of Naval Research and DARPA. Tor was deployed in 2003, as their third generation of deployed onion routing designs.<ref name="ieee"/> In 2005, the Electronic Frontier Foundation provided additional funding to the Free Haven Project.<ref name="ieee"/> In 2006, the Tor Project was incorporated as a non-profit organization.<ref name="ieee"/>
