 European research 
In 2012 the European Commission has issued an analysis of the relevance of the open research issues for commercial stabilisation <ref>cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/ssai/docs/future-cc-2may-finalreport-experts.pdf |title=Advances in Clouds - Research in Future Cloud Computing |publisher=European Commission |date=2012-05-02 |accessdate=2014-02-06</ref> in which various experts from industry and academia identify in particular the following major concerns:

* open interoperation across (proprietary) cloud solutions at IaaS, PaaS and SaaS levels
* managing multitenancy at large scale and in heterogeneous environments
* dynamic and seamless elasticity from inhouse clouds to public clouds for unusual (scale, complexity) and/or infrequent requirements
* data management in a cloud environment, taking the technical and legal constraints into consideration

These findings have been refined into a research roadmap proposed by the Cloud Computing Expert Group on Research in December 2012 <ref>cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=2165 |title=A Roadmap for Advanced Cloud Technologies under H2020 |publisher=European Commission |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-02-06</ref> which tries to lay out a timeline for the identified research topics according to their commercial relevance. With the 8th Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development, the European Commission is trying to support the according research work along the lines of the Europe 2020 strategy.
