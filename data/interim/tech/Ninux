Ninux.org is a Wireless Network Community in Italy, a free, open and experimental computer network.<ref name="ninux">cite web|url=http://wiki.ninux.org/NinuxOrgFAQInEnglish|title=NinuxOrgFAQInEnglish - ninux.org Wiki|publisher=wiki.ninux.org|accessdate=2014-03-15</ref> The main idea is that users build their own computer network without central control or property, as opposed to traditional Internet service providers (ISP), where a single entity owns and manages the network. The initiative is based on the Ninux manifesto,<ref name="ninux2">cite web|url=http://wiki.ninux.org/NinuxOrgManifesto|title=NinuxOrgManifesto - ninux.org Wiki|publisher=wiki.ninux.org|accessdate=2014-03-15</ref> the Wireless Commons Manifesto<ref name="ninux3">cite web|url=http://wiki.ninux.org/WirelessCommonsManifesto|title=WirelessCommonsManifesto - ninux.org Wiki|publisher=wiki.ninux.org|accessdate=2014-03-15</ref> and the Picopeering Agreement.<ref name="picopeer">cite web|url=http://www.picopeer.net/PPA-en.html|title=Picopeering Agreement v1.0|publisher=picopeer.net|accessdate=2014-03-15</ref> In these agreements participants agree upon a network that is free from discrimination, in the sense of net neutrality.

With 352 active nodes and 2216 planned nodes,<ref>[http://map.ninux.org/ Map of the ninux.org network]</ref> it is one of the top ten List of wireless community networks by region|Wireless Community Networks in the world in number of active nodes. Ninux is part of the international movement for open wireless radio networks. For more information on such projects around the world, see wireless community network.

Since 2013, Ninux is an experimental member of the NaMeX Internet Exchange Point <ref>[http://blog.ninux.org/2014/01/09/ninux-org-si-connette-al-namex Ninux.org connects to Namex blog post (italian)]</ref><ref>[http://www.namex.it/en/who/members NaMeX Member List] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009225743/http://www.namex.it/en/who/members |date=2011-10-09 </ref> in Rome.

 History 
It was born in Rome around 2002 and now spanning all over Italy. Its name currently stands for "Neighborhood Internet, Network Under eXperiment". In fact, Ninux.org has been testing devices, auto-built antennas and routing protocols while exchanging knowledge with the other Community Networks in Europe.

Ninux has participated since its early editions in the organization of the Battlemesh.<ref>[http://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV3 Battlemesh V3 edition hosted by Ninux]</ref><ref>[http://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV7/Endorsements Ninux as part of the Battlemesh event]</ref> Member since 2014 of the Community-Lab.net<ref>[http://Community-lab.net Community-Lab.net]</ref> testbed.
