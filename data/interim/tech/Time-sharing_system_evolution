This article covers the evolution of time-sharing systems, providing links to major early time-sharing operating systems, showing their subsequent evolution.

Time-sharing
Main|Time-sharing

Time-sharing was developed in the late 1950s out of the realization that a single expensive computer could be efficiently utilized if a multitasking, multiprogramming operating system allowed multiple users simultaneous Interactive computing|interactive access. Typically an individual user would enter bursts of information followed by long pauses; but with a group of users working at the same time, the pauses of one user would be filled by the activity of the others. Similarly, small slices of time spent waiting for disk, tape, or network input could be granted to other users. Given an optimal group size, the overall process could be very efficient.

Each user would use their own computer terminal; initially electromechanical teleprinters such as the Teletype Model 33 ASR or the Friden Flexowriter, but from about 1970 these were progressively superseded by cathode ray tube|CRT-based units such as the Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC VT05, Datapoint 2200 and Lear Siegler ADM-3A.

Terminals were initially linked to a nearby computer via current loop or serial cables, by conventional electric telegraph#Teleprinters|telegraph circuits provided by Postal, telegraph and telephone service|PTTs and over specialist digital leased lines such T-carrier|T1. Modems such as the Bell 103 modem|Bell 103 and successors, allowed remote and higher-speed use over the Plain old telephone service|analogue voice telephone network.

Family tree of major systems

See details and additional systems in the table below. Relationships shown here are for the purpose of grouping entries and do not reflect all influences (e.g., OS/2 was more influenced by VAX/VMS than by MS-DOS, but its legacy is as an x86 platform).
