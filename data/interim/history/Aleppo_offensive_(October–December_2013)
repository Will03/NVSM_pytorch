Campaignbox Battle of Aleppo

The October–December 2013 Aleppo offensive or Operation Northern Storm<ref>cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-and-hezbollah-advance-in-southern-and-eastern-aleppo-latest-map-update/|title=Syrian Army and Hezbollah Advance in Southern and Eastern Aleppo – Latest Map Update|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News|date=11 November 2015|accessdate=11 November 2015</ref> was a campaign during the Syrian civil war launched by the Syrian army in the Aleppo Governorate to reopen a key supply route linking central Syria to the largest city, Aleppo. The offensive began when the Syrian Army attacked the strategic town of Khanasir.

 Background 
In June 2013, after their strategic Battle of al-Qusayr (2013)|capture of al-Qusayr, government forces launched an offensive called Northern Storm in Aleppo Province aimed at securing supply lines between disparate patches of control in the province. However, increased rebel pressure in Homs Governorate|Homs Province led the government to abandon the offensive and redeploy its troops there, leaving its supply lines to Aleppo city vulnerable to attack.<ref name="adiyat dabha"/>

Later in the summer, rebels capitalised on this strategic weakness. In late July, rebels launched an offensive west of Aleppo city culminating in the capture of several suburbs and Khan al-Assal massacre|a massacre of captured government soldiers, and on 5 August, the long-besieged Menagh Airbase in the north of the province Siege of Menagh Air Base|fell to the rebels. On 26 August, rebels captured the strategic town of Khanasir, thus cutting the government's last land supply route to the contested city of Aleppo.<ref>cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/2013826124946176888.html|title=Syria rebels take control of strategic town|date=26 August 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=17 October 2013</ref>

Rebels then turned their sights to the government-controlled southern countryside of Aleppo. On 20 September, a coalition of at least ten rebel groups led by Ahrar ash-Sham and the Tawhid Brigade launched an offensive called [http://quran.com/100 ''wal-'Adiyat Dabha''] against government positions between the southern edge of the city and the defence factories outside of rebel-held Al-Safira. In the first six days of the offensive, rebels made significant advances, claiming to have captured at least 25 villages.<ref>Names of villages (from The Institute for the Study of War): Kafr Hout, al-Zaraa, Kafr Kar, Banan al-Has, Sarj Far'a, Balouza, Burj 'Azawi, Madrasa village, Im Jaran, Qanatrat, Samaria, Maghriyat al-Shebli, al-Mayan, al-Manatir, Rasm al-Safa, Rasm Humud, Mazraa Ali Hussein, Diyman, Sada’aya, Rasm al-Shih, Mazraa al-Ayoub, Rasm al-Hilwa, Tayeba, Rasm 'Akirish, and al-Sufayrah</ref> In response, government forces from Aleppo International Airport redeployed south to counter the rebel offensive.<ref name="adiyat dabha">cite web|url=http://iswsyria.blogspot.com/2013/09/offensives-in-aleppo-from-july.html|title=The wal-'Adiyat Dabha Offensive in Southern Aleppo|last=Caris|first=Charlie|author2=Isabel Nassief|date=26 September 2013|publisher=Institute for the Study of War|accessdate=17 October 2013</ref>

 The offensive 

= Capture of Khanasir and reopening of the highway =
To reopen supply lines to Aleppo city, the government launched a counteroffensive along the so-called "Desert Road" between Aleppo and Salamiyah, dispatching a large convoy from the latter backed with heavy air support. Khanasir, captured by rebels in August, was the first major objective of the Army as it occupies a critical chokepoint on the road.

On 1 October, the shelling of Khanasir and fighting between the Army and rebels in the vicinity of the town killed at least 20 rebel fighters. The village of Jub al-Ghaws, near of Khanasir was bombed by helicopters while, according to SOHR, rebel fighters hit a fighter airplane above Khanasir.<ref>cite web|author=|url=http://supportkurds.org/news/tuesday-1-october-2013/ |title=Tuesday 1 October 2013 |publisher=Supportkurds.org |date=2 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014</ref>

On 2 October, according to SOHR, the Syrian Army progressed in Khanasir, taking control of parts of the city while a large number of rebel positions were hit by the Air Force in the province; al-Atareb, Khan al-A'sal, Kafrnaha and Minnegh military airport.citation needed|date=December 2013

On 3 October, the Army took back control of Khanasir, with at least 25 rebel fighters and 18 pro-government militiamen being killed between 1 and 2 October.

On 8 November, before sunrise, the Syrian Army launched an attack against "Base 80", controlled by the rebels since February 2013, near the Aleppo airport.

The attack came as a real shock to us." According to Al-Jazeera, if the Army captured the base, it would cut the rebel supply routes between Aleppo city and the opposition-controlled town of al-Bab, about 30 kilometers from the Turkish border.<ref>cite web|url=http://live.aljazeera.com/Event/Syria_Live_Blog/95575090 |title=Syria Live Blog |publisher=Live.aljazeera.com |date=8 November 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014</ref> By morning, the Army took over several areas of "Base 80", leaving them in control of large parts of it.
