</ref> The program originally began in 1958, with a ''Gold Award'' for singles and albums that reach $1,000,000 in sales. The criterion was changed in 1975 to the number of copies sold, with albums selling 500,000 copies awarded the Gold Award. In 1976, a ''Platinum Award'' was added for one million sales. In 1989 new criteria were introduced, with a "Gold Award" for singles that reach 500,000 in sales and a "Platinum Award" for singles that reach 1,000,000 in sales; and in 1999 a ''Diamond Award'' for ten million sales was introduced.<ref name=history>cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=historyx |title=Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=March 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701162808/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=historyx |archivedate=July 1, 2007 |df=mdy-all </ref> The awards are open to both RIAA members and non-members.<ref>cite web

="Digital" single certification=
In 2004, the RIAA added a branch of certification for what it calls "digital" recordings, meaning roughly "recordings transferred to the recipient over a network" (such as those sold via the iTunes Store), and excluding other obviously digital media such as those on Compact Disc|CD, Digital Audio Tape|DAT, or MiniDisc. In 2006, "digital ringtones" were added to this branch of certification.  Starting in 2013, streaming from audio and video streaming services such as Spotify and YouTube also began to be counted towards the certification using the formula of 100 streams being the equivalent of one download, RIAA certification for singles therefore no longer represents true sales.<ref>cite web |url= https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=newsandviews&news_month_filter=5&id=03662575-C88F-51CF-779C-8396A2B8D74D |title=RIAA Adds Digital Streams To Historic Gold & Platinum Awards |publisher=RIAA </ref><ref>cite news |url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1560846/exclusive-on-demand-streams-now-count-toward-riaa-gold-platinum |title=Exclusive: On-Demand Streams Now Count Toward RIAA Gold & Platinum|author= Alex Pham |date= May 9, 2013 |work=Billboard </ref> In the same year, the RIAA introduced the Latin Digital Award for digital recordings in Spanish.<ref name=latindigital/>    As of|2016, the certification criteria for these recordings are as follows:<ref>cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DIGITAL-SINGLE-AWARD-RIAA-AND-GRF-CERTIFICATION-AUDIT-REQUIREMENTS.pdf |title=RIAA AND GR&F Certification Audit Requirements: RIAA Digital Single Award|work=RIAA </ref>

Efforts against infringement of members' copyrights

=Efforts against file sharing=
Main article|Trade group efforts against file sharing

The RIAA opposes unauthorized sharing of its music. Studies conducted since the association began its campaign against peer-to-peer file-sharing have concluded that losses incurred per download range from negligible<ref>cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - FileSharing_March2004.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=July 17, 2010</ref><ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&res=9C02E2D91139F936A35757C0A9629C8B63 ''A Heretical View of File Sharing''], by John Schwartz, The New York Times, ''April 5, 2004''</ref> to moderate.<ref>Siwek, Stephen E.

The association has commenced high-profile lawsuits against file sharing service providers. It has also commenced a series of lawsuits against individuals suspected of file sharing, notably college students and parents of file sharing children. It is accused of employing techniques such as peer-to-peer "decoying" and "Spoofing (anti-piracy measure)|spoofing" to combat file sharing.<ref>cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/01/17/i_poisoned_p2p_networks/ |title="I poisoned P2P networks for the RIAA" – whistleblower |author=The Register |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |date=January 17, 2003</ref><ref>cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/03/18/riaa_chief_invokes_martin_luther/ |title=RIAA chief invokes Martin Luther King in pigopoly defense: P2P poisoning, ISP clampdown justified |author=The Register |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |date=March 18, 2003</ref>

Selection of defendants
The RIAA names defendants based on ISP identification of the subscriber associated with an IP address,<ref>cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/27/earlyshow/leisure/music/main1166218.shtml |title=Mom Fights Recording Industry |author=CBS News |accessdate=April 2, 2007 |date=December 27, 2005</ref> and as such do not know any additional information about a person before they sue. After an Internet subscriber's identity is discovered, but before an individual lawsuit is filed, the subscriber is typically offered an opportunity to settle. The standard settlement is a payment to the RIAA and an agreement not to engage in file-sharing of music and is usually on par with statutory damages of $750 per work, with the RIAA choosing the number of works it deems "reasonable." For cases that do not settle at this amount, the RIAA has gone to trial, seeking statutory damages from the jury, written into The Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act of 1999 as between $750 and $30,000 per work or $750 and $150,000 per work if "willful."

Settlement programs

In February 2007, the RIAA began sending letters accusing Internet users of sharing files and directing them to web site <small>P2PLAWSUITS.COM</small>, where they can make "discount" settlements payable by credit card.<ref>cite news |title=RIAA Bullies College Students With P2PLawsuits.com|url=http://consumerist.com/2007/03/riaa-bullies-college-students-with-p2plawsuitscom.html|author=Meg Marco|date=March 2007</ref> The letters go on to say that anyone not settling will have lawsuits brought against them. Typical settlements are between $3,000 and $12,000. This new strategy was formed because the RIAA's legal fees were cutting into the income from settlements.<ref name="Read A31">cite news |first=Brock |last=Read |title=Record Companies to Accused Pirates: Deal or No Deal? |url=http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i28/28a03101.htm |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |page=A31 |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=April 2, 2007 </ref> In 2008, RIAA sued 19-year-old Ciara Sauro for allegedly sharing ten songs online.<ref>cite news|title=Teen Transplant Candidate Sued Over Music Downloads|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/riaa-preys-teen-need-transplant|publisher=thepittsburghchannel.com|date=December 9, 2008</ref>

The RIAA also launched an "early Settlement (law)|settlement program" directed to ISPs and to colleges and universities, urging them to pass along letters to subscribers and students offering early settlements, prior to the disclosure of their identities. The settlement letters urged ISPs to preserve evidence for the benefit of the RIAA and invited the students and subscribers to visit an RIAA website for the purpose of entering into a "discount settlement" payable by credit card.<ref>"[http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2007/02/riaa-adopts-new-policy-offers-pre-doe.html RIAA Adopts New Policy, offers Pre-Doe settlement option if ISP Holds Logs Longer, Asks ISP's to Correct Identification Mistakes]" Recording Industry vs. The People, February 13, 2007.</ref> By March 2007, the focus had shifted from ISPs to colleges and universities.<ref name="Read A31"/><ref>"[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117960319.html?categoryid=18&cs=1 RIAA targets university students]" (Variety.com)</ref><ref>[https://archive.is/20070927030702/http://www.theeastcarolinian.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&ustory_id=4e74bd26-4c1b-4c88-8d84-d915653c9459 "Recording industry battles piracy"] by Elizabeth Lauten, ''The East Carolinian'' (East Carolina University), April 4, 2007</ref>

In October 1998, the Recording Industry Association of America filed a lawsuit in the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco claiming the Diamond Multimedia Rio PMP300 player violated the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act. The Rio PMP300 was significant because it was the second portable consumer MP3 digital audio player released on the market.

In September 2003, the RIAA filed suit in civil court against several private individuals who had shared large numbers of files with Kazaa. Most of these suits were settled with monetary payments averaging $3,000. Kazaa publisher Sharman Networks responded with a lawsuit against the RIAA, alleging that the terms of use of the network were violated and that unauthorized client software was used in the investigation to track down the individual file sharers (such as Kazaa Lite). An effort to throw out this suit was denied in January 2004, however, that suit was settled in 2006. Sharman Networks agreed to a global settlement of litigation brought against it by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the International Federation of Phonographic Industry (IFPI), and the RIAA. The creators of the popular Kazaa file-sharing network will pay $115 million to the RIAA, unspecified future amounts to the MPAA and the software industry, and install filters on its networks to prevent users from sharing copyrighted works on its network.<ref>cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/07/7363/ |title=Sharman Networks settles Kazaa file-sharing lawsuits |publisher=Ars Technica |date=July 27, 2006 |accessdate=July 23, 2013</ref>

On October 12, 2007, the RIAA sued Usenet.com seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the company from "aiding, encouraging, enabling, inducing, causing, materially contributing to, or otherwise facilitating" copyright infringement. This suit, the first that the RIAA has filed against a Usenet provider, has added another branch to the RIAA's rapidly expanding fight to curb the copyright infringement|unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials. Unlike many of the RIAA's previous lawsuits, this suit is filed against the provider of a service who has no direct means of removing infringing content. The RIAA's argument relies heavily on the fact the Usenet.com, the only defendant that has been named currently, promoted their service with slogans and phrases that strongly suggested that the service could be used to obtain free music.

On April 28, 2008, RIAA member labels sued Project Playlist, a web music search site, claiming that the majority of the sound recordings in the site's index of links are infringing. Project Playlist's website denies that any of the music is hosted on Project Playlist's own servers.<ref>cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9930419-7.html |title=RIAA files copyright suit against Project Playlist |author=Sandoval, Greg |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=April 28, 2008 |accessdate=December 5, 2010</ref>

On June 30, 2009, The Recording Industry Association of America prevailed in its fight against Usenet.com, in a decision, that the U.S. District Judge Harold Baer of the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of the music industry on all its main arguments: that Usenet.com is guilty of direct, contributory, and vicarious infringement. In addition, and perhaps most importantly for future cases, Baer said that Usenet.com can't claim protection under the Sony Betamax decision. That ruling states that companies can't be held liable for contributory infringement if the device they create is "capable of significant non-infringing uses."<ref>cite web|first=Greg |last=Sandoval |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10276607-93.html|title=RIAA triumphs in Usenet copyright case|date= December 17, 2011</ref> Furthermore, the parties are now headed to federal court for damage assessments and awards, which could amount to several millions of dollars for the music industry.<ref>cite web

=The "work made for hire" controversy=

In 1999, Mitch Glazier, a Congressional staff attorney, inserted, without public notice or comment, substantive language into the final markup of a "technical corrections" section of copyright legislation, classifying many music recordings as "Work for hire|works made for hire", thereby stripping artists of their copyright interests and transferring those interests to their record labels.<ref>cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2000/08/38129?currentPage=all |title=Rule Reversal: Blame It on RIAA |accessdate=April 9, 2007|author=Wired |date=August 10, 2000</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100712/23482610186.shtml |title=RIAA Accounting: Why Even Major Label Musicians Rarely Make Money From Album Sales</ref> Shortly afterwards, Glazier was hired as Senior Vice President of Government Relations and Legislative Counsel for the RIAA, which vigorously defended the change when it came to light.<ref>cite web |author=Eric Boehlert |date=August 28, 2000 |url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/music/feature/2000/08/28/work_for_hire/print.html |title=Four Little Words |publisher=Salon |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123063924/http://archive.salon.com/ent/music/feature/2000/08/28/work_for_hire/print.html |archivedate=January 23, 2009 |df=mdy-all </ref> The battle over the disputed provision led to the formation of the Recording Artists' Coalition, which successfully lobbied for repeal of the change.<ref>cite web |author=Barry Willis |date=October 29, 2000 |url=http://www.stereophile.com/news/10880/ |title=Clinton Signs Repeal of "Works for Hire" Law |publisher=Stereophile |accessdate=October 9, 2009</ref><ref>USPL|106|379</ref>
