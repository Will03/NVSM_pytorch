Ultratop is an organization which generates and publishes the official record charts in Belgium. Ultratop is a non-profit organization, created on the initiative of the Belgian Entertainment Association|Belgian Entertainment Association (BEA), the Belgian member organization of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.<ref>[http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_links/local_associations.html "LINKS - Local record industry associations"]. IFPI. Retrieved 2010-05-31.</ref> Two parallel set of charts are concurrently produced and published, one on behalf of Belgium's Dutch-speaking Flanders region, and the other catering to the nation's French-speaking region of Wallonia.

Ultratop charts
The music charts produced by Ultratop organization are separated along regional-language boundaries, an unusual division that is justified by the pitytjculture of Belgium|cultural differences in Belgium. So it is that the Dutch-speaking Flanders region has one set of charts of record activity there, while the French-speaking Wallonia region has another set to measure popularity in those provinces.

The charts are broadcast on several Belgian radio stations, and on TV stations TMF Flanders|TMF in Flanders and Plug RTL in Wallonia.<ref name="ultratop">cite web|url=http://www.ultratop.be/fr/ultratop_en.asp|title=Ultratop Belgian Charts|work=Ultratop.be |publisher=ULTRATOP & Hung Medien / hitparade.ch|accessdate=2010-05-31</ref>

=Procedure=
Ultratop creates charts based on record sales of around 500 retail outlets and legal digital downloads.<ref name="ultratop"/> Currently GfK is the market observer of the charts.

Ultratip
In addition to the main Ultratop 50, another weekly singles chart known as  is published. Also referred to as the it is an indicator chart of commercially available singles, with chart positions based on a combination of sales and airplay, i.e., the number of times a song is played on the radio or television, coupled with the calculated audience size for each station, region and language.

Ultratip differs from the Ultratop charts, in that it depends on both airplay and sales, whereas Ultratop charts are based solely on sales. A song cannot chart on the Ultratip chart on airplay figures alone.<ref name="ultratop"/>
