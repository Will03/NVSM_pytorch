Political hip hop is a subgenre of hip hop music that was developed in the 1980s as a way of turning rap music into a call for action and a form of social activism. Inspired by 1970s political preachers such as The Last Poets and musician Gil Scott-Heron, Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy was the first predominately political hip-hop group.<ref>[Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d12013|pure_url=yes Political Rap]. Allmusic. Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref> It has helped to create a new form of social expression for subordinate groups to speak about their exclusions, injustices and lack of power.<ref>[http://journals1.scholarsportal.info/pdf/02611430/v33i0003/473_rrarhheapd.xml Rhythm, rhyme and reason: hip hop expressivity as political discourse"],</ref><ref>"[http://journals2.scholarsportal.info/pdf/00380237/v39i0002/133_prtmoor.xml Political Rap: The Music of Oppositional Resistance]",</ref> Political hip-hop is the use of hip hop music to send political messages to inspire action or to convince the listener of a particular worldview. There  is no all-encompassing political hip-hop ideology; rather, there are multiple perspectives that range anywhere from Marxism to the values of the Five Percent Nation.

Conscious hip hop

Conscious hip hop, or socially conscious hip-hop, is a subgenre of hip hop that challenges the dominant cultural, political, philosophical, and economic consensus,<ref name="Adaso Conscious"/> and/or comments on social issues and conflicts. Conscious hip hop is not necessarily overtly political, but the terms "conscious hip hop" and "political hip hop" are sometimes used interchangeably. The term "nation-conscious rap" has been used to more specifically describe hip hop music with strong political messages and themes.<ref>Cite journal|jstor=466354|title = The State of Rap: Time and Place in Hip Hop Nationalism|last = Decker|first = Jeffery Louis|date = 1993|journal = Social Text No. 34|doi = 10.2307/466354|pmid =</ref> Themes of conscious hip hop include Afrocentricity, religion, aversion to crime and violence, culture, the economy, or depictions of the struggles of ordinary people. Conscious hip hop often seeks to raise awareness of social issues, leaving the listeners to form their own opinions, rather than aggressively advocating for certain ideas and demanding actions.<ref name="Adaso Conscious">cite web|last1=Adaso|first1=Henry|title=What is Conscious Hip Hop?|url=http://rap.about.com/od/genresstyles/p/ConsciousRap.htm|website=About.com|publisher=About.com|accessdate=14 November 2015</ref>

History of political and conscious hip hop

= Origins and early development =
Before the emergence of political hip hop,  the Black Power Movement and the emphasis on black pride arising in the mid-1960s and blossoming in the early-1970s inspired several commentaries that incorporated Black Power ideological elements. Songs expressing the theme of black pride include: James Brown's "Say it Loud (I'm Black and Proud)" (1969), and Billy Paul's "Am I Black Enough for You?" (1972). The proto-rap of Gil Scott-Heron is an early influence on political and conscious rap, though most of his earlier socially conscious and political albums fall within the jazz, Soul music|soul, and funk genres. Following Ronald Reagan’s election as President in 1980, conditions in inner-city African-American communities worsened, and hip-hop political commentators began to increasingly address worsening social problems such as mass unemployment, police brutality, incarceration, inadequate public schools, political apathy, and oppression.<ref>cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=James |title=MESSAGE IN THE MUSIC: POLITICAL COMMENTARY IN BLACK POPULAR MUSIC FROM RHYTHM AND BLUES TO EARLY HIP HOP |journal=The Journal of African American History |date=Summer 2005 |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=196–225 |url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/1734370/mod_resource/content/1/Stewart%20on%20Politics%20and%20R%20and%20B%20Music.pdf|language=en |jstor=20063998</ref> One of the first socially conscious hip-hop songs was "How We Gonna Make The Black Nation Rise?" by Brother D with Collective Effort.<ref>cite web|last1=Abramovich|first1=Alex|title=Alex Abramovich: Agitate, Educate, Organize|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2013/08/05/alex-abramovich/agitate-educate-organize/|website=LRB blog</ref> The first majorly successful hip hop song containing conscious rap was Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's "The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message", an influential political and conscious hip hop track, decrying the poverty, violence, and dead-end lives of the urban poor of the time.

The controversial debut album ''Straight Outta Compton'' by N.W.A, released in 1988 brought gangsta rap to the mainstream, but it also contained harsh social and political commentary, including the confrontational track "Fuck tha Police."  Ice-T's work would sometimes focus on other topics: for example, he rapped about free speech on The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say!|his third album, and about drunk driving, domestic violence and Nelson Mandela on O.G. Original Gangster|his fourth album.<ref>cite web|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Peter|title=Straight Outta Compton review – how hip-hop pioneers NWA took on the world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/27/straight-outta-compton-review-how-hip-hop-pioneers-nwa-took-on-the-world|website=The Guardian|date=27 August 2015</ref>

After his departure from the group N.W.A in 1989, Ice Cube embarked on a solo career and released socio-political and conscious rap with gangsta rap elements in his 1990 debut album ''Amerikkka's Most Wanted'' and the companion Extended play|EP ''Kill at Will''; the 1991 album ''Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate''; followed by the 1992 album, ''The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator''.<ref name=MTV>cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen|title=About Ice Cube|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/ice-cube/biography/|website=MTV|publisher=MTV|accessdate=14 November 2015</ref> Ice Cube's first two albums were produced by the hip-hop production team the Bomb Squad, known for their work with the socio-political rap group Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy. Furthermore, Ice Cube produced and appeared on the controversial and radical political rap/gangsta rap album ''Guerillas in tha Mist'' by Da Lench Mob in the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles Riots.<ref name="MTV"/> Though Ice Cube would continue to sporadically insert political and social commentary into his music throughout his career, he once again focused on conscious and political rap with his 2006 album ''Laugh Now, Cry Later''<ref name="MTV"/> and 2008's ''Raw Footage'', featuring the single "Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It", a song dealing with the perceived correlation between music and global issues (e.g. the Iraq War, school shootings, etc.).

Hip hop in politics
Hip hop's outreach to the political world is widespread. The response that hip hop has received from mainstream politics has been vast and has resulted in the spread of ideas, opinions, and the formation of an informal dialogue surrounding largely controversial topics.

From the onset of hip hop in the 1980s throughout the 1990s, the culture was either ignored or criticized by politicians on both sides. "In the 1990s... there was one cultural idea that seemed to have bi-partisan support: that rap music was a symptom of the destruction of American values."<ref name="auto">cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=Dana|title=Hip-Hop in Politics|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/hip-hop-politics-difference-generation-makes/story?id=18495205|website=ABC News|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=24 October 2015</ref>  This opinion, however, fails to recognize the historical oppression and injustices experienced by blacks and other minority groups which rap music and the hip hop scene sought to bring attention to. In 1992, Vice President of the United States|Vice President Dan Quayle called on Interscope Records to withdraw ''2Pacalypse Now'' because it was a "disgrace to American music". The catalyst for Quayle's outrage was an incident when a Texas youth shot a state trooper and referenced the album as his motivation.<ref name="auto"/> In ''2Pacalypse Now'' rapper Tupac Shakur raised issues of institutional racism, teen pregnancy, and police brutality.<ref name=XXL>cite web|last1=Steiner|first1=B.J.|title=2Pac Shakur Drops '2Pacalypse Now'|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/hip-hop-today/2013/11/today-hip-hop-tupac-shakur-releases-2pacalypse-now/|website=XXL Magazine|accessdate=30 November 2015</ref> He tells a fictional story of how a police officer slams him on the ground for no cause, but before he gets arrested the police officer is shot. His lyrics read "how can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?"

Today, hip-hop music has grown to be such a large part of mainstream culture that The Washington Post wrote "The politician's guide to how to be down with hip hop.",<ref name="auto1">cite web|last1=Schwarz|first1=Hunter|title=The Politician's Guide to how to be Down with Hip Hop|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/31/the-politicians-guide-to-how-to-be-down-with-hip-hop/|website=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=24 October 2015</ref>  which draws reference to the use of hip hop culture in politics. The criticism of hip hop that was considered patriotic or even moral one generation ago, can make a politician seem "out of touch", especially with younger voters.<ref name="auto1"/> Politician Mike Huckabee was viewed as being "out of touch" when he referred to Beyoncé as "mental poison" in his book: ''God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy''.<ref>cite web|last1=O'neil|first1=Lorena|title=Most Iowa Republicans Agree that Beyonce is Mental Poison|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6458350/beyonce-mike-huckabee-iowa-poll|website=Billboard.com|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=24 October 2015</ref> In 2008, during Barack Obama's Democratic primary campaign against then-rival Hillary Clinton, he referenced Jay Z by doing his "Brush the dirt off your shoulder" motion in a rally and the audience erupted with support. The embrace of hip-hop has not occurred on party lines. Republican Senator Marco Rubio is a vocal fan of Tupac and Gangsta rap. Rubio said "In some ways rappers are like reporters... You had gang wars, racial tension, and they were reporting on that."<ref name="auto"/>  The 2016 GOP|Republican Party nominee for president, Donald Trump, has also leveraged hip-hop to his advantage. He occasionally quotes that rapper Mac Miller wrote a song called "Donald Trump", and that it has over 100,000,000 views.<ref name="auto1"/>

Ideology and views of political rappers

=America=

Anti-racism, black liberation and nationalism
As hip-hop is a music genre dominated by African-Americans, political rappers often reference and discuss black liberation. In particular, the Five-Percent Nation, an Islamic group that focuses on black liberation theology, has a high membership of popular rappers and has had an integral influence on hip hop culture. There are numerous hip hop songs expressing Anti-racism|anti-racist views, such as the popular The Black Eyed Peas song "Where Is the Love?", however, artists advocating more for radical black liberation have remained controversial. Artists such as Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy, Tupac Shakur, Ice Cube, Game (rapper)|Game, and Kendrick Lamar have advocated black liberation in their lyrics and poetry. Many<sup>[''wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Unsupported attributions|who?'']</sup> refer to these artists as Black nationalism|black nationalists. Tupac Shakur's poem, "How Can We Be Free" Tupac prose the sacrifices of Black political prisoners and the rejection of patriotic symbols. In recent years, Killer Mike and Kendrick Lamar have released songs criticizing the War on Drugs and the prison industrial complex from an anti-racist perspective. Hip hop music continues to draw the attention and support of the struggles of minority groups in a modernist method of communication that attracts a young crowd of activists. Kendrick Lamar and many other rappers have been credited with creating discussions regarding "blackness" through their music.

Anti-poverty, class struggle and socialism
Particularly with the advent of gangsta rap, many hip hop artists happen to come from underclass backgrounds. Aforementioned artists such as Tupac Shakur, Ice Cube, and Killer Mike have made just as much reference to class oppression as racial oppression. Tupac Shakur used his lyrics incorporated Revolutionary Nationalism. In "Words of Wisdom" from the album ''2Pacalypse,'' Shakur's lyrics underscore the refusal to accept economic inequality and inadequate employment opportunities. Other political rappers, such as Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy, The Dope Poet Society, Dead Prez, The Coup, Paris (rapper)|Paris and Immortal Technique, have advocated explicitly Communism|communist views —mostly leaning to Marxism-Leninism-Maoism|Maoism—, whereas some rappers such as Lupe Fiasco and the lesser-known Emcee Lynx, P.O.S (rapper)|P.O.S, and Sole (artist)|Sole have advocated Anarchism|anarchist positions. Political references have long been made in hip hop culture; some proving to be effective in spurring constructive discussion and others, such as The Coup's originally planned album cover for Party Music—which depicted the destruction of World Trade Center (1973–2001)|The World Trade Center to signify the fall of capitalism—receiving negative criticisms (although the album art was designed before the September 11 attacks and was changed prior to its November 2001 release).

Conspiracy theories
Conspiracy theories have been referenced in hip hop lyrics for some time. Elements of the Five-Percenter philosophy that has fundamentally influenced hip hop culture revolve around conspiracy theories. Artists such as Professor Griff, Jedi Mind Tricks, and Hopsin have become infamous for their support of New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order, Illuminati, and Satanism|Satanist conspiracy theories, often alleging mainstream hip hop artists, such as Jay-Z, are "involved" in such conspiracies. Other political rappers, such as Tupac Shakur, have been heavily critical of conspiracy theories.citation needed|date=December 2016

Views on religion
Rappers often reference their religious views. However, outside of Five-Percenters and Nation of Islam|Black Muslims, they rarely translate into political views. Killer Mike, however, has been heavily critical of organized religion in many of his more political songs.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/listen-killer-mike-talks-burn-religion-with-cnn/55894/|title=Listen: Killer Mike Talks 'Burn,' Religion With CNN|work=Prefixmag</ref> Chicago-raised rapper Kanye West's ''Life of Pablo'' album release is another that offers an outlet for religious expression and self-assessment. Rap and hip hop music are outlets for whatever creative inner dialogue their creators wish to express, and religious beliefs are no exception.

Libertarianism
Political rapper KRS-One identifies as a libertarianism|libertarian and has voiced support for Ron Paul.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2011/09/30/krs-one-to-rock-the-ron-paul-revolution-tour|title=KRS-One to Rock the Ron Paul Revolution Tour|work=Portland Mercury</ref>

Big Boi has also identified as a libertarian, and stated he intended OutKast's "B.O.B. (song)|B.O.B." as a libertarian, anti-war song.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/11/big-boi-outkast-vote-gary-johnson-obama_n_2460511.html|title=Big Boi, Of Outkast, Explains Voting For Gary Johnson Over Obama (VIDEO)|date=12 January 2013|work=The Huffington Post</ref> Despite this, he has voiced support for social democracy|social democrat Bernie Sanders during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.<ref>cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/article/18458/big-boi-outkast-bernie-sanders-endorsement-prison-reform|title=Sorry, Ms. Clinton: Outkast’s Big Boi Backs Bernie Sanders|publisher=</ref>

=Worldwide=
On a global scale, hip hop's public reputation and exhibition is varied. For instance, Canada's most prominent political hip hop act is The Dope Poet Society, who are known for anti-racist and anti-war activism, as well as denouncing both liberal and conservative politicians. Their politics could be described as third-worldism, or black internationalism. For example, in "Bombay to Zimbabwe," lead rapper Professor D states "from Bombay to Zimbabwe I study sharply: Bob Marley, Marcus Garvey, Mahatma Gandhi, Black Panther Party."<ref>cite web|url=https://genius.com/11652622|title=Bombay to Zimbabwe|author=ProfessorD.us - The Dope Poet Society|date=4 June 2017|work=Third World Warriors, Vol. 1</ref> Possibly on purpose, these influences seem ideologically contradictory in some ways (e.g. for instance, Marley's subtle socialism vs. Garvey's anti-communism, and non-violence vs. violence) but taken together they represent different approaches to the shared goal of linking anti-racist and anti-colonial struggles in the Americas and the rest of the world. Professor D and The Dope Poet Society also seem to represent this ideology on their album by featuring American political rappers like dead prez and others with rappers from around the world including Nigeria and Columbia. Other examples of hip hop around the world offer opposite perspectives. For example, Lowkey and Iron Sheik have expressed anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist views in their music, whereas Golan and Subliminal (rapper)|Subliminal have expressed Zionism|pro-Zionist views.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/5774/|title=A Zionist Hip-Hop Stance Comes to Lollapalooza|author=Dimitri Ehrlich|date=4 June 2004|work=The Forward</ref> In France, some political artists such as Suprême NTM, the rapper :fr:Casey (rappeuse)|Casey or Assassin are well known since the early-1990s. Today, rappers like Kery James, La Rumeur, Rocé or Médine (rapper)|Médine are influential; their lyrics speak about colonialism, poverty, French history and sometimes conspiracy theories.
