This is a list of pen names used by notable authors of written work.

Dynamic list

A pen name or ''nom de plume'' is a pseudonym adopted by an author. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise their gender, to distance an author from some or all of their previous works, to protect the author from retribution for their writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.

<!-- There is generally one Wikipedia link per entry below, either the author's pen name or real name, whichever is the more notable and has the Wikipedia article. Do not link from both names unless both have an article. Do not link to a redirect, instead change the name here to match the name of the article; especially do not link to a redirect pointing to the other name. Ensure the article being linked to mentions the other name (pen name or real name) in bold font in its lead section. Ensure a redirect exists for the other name (pen name or real name), whichever has no article, pointing to the other name.
