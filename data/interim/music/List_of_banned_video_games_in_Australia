Below is a list and summary of video games that have been Australian Classification Board|Refused Classification (banned) within Australia.

Overview

main|Video gaming in Australia

Originally, video games in Australia could only be rated up to MA15+. At the time, the R18+ classification rating could be given to film, but a video game with content deemed fitting for the R18+ rating would be 'Refused Classification' due to an appropriate classification not being available for the medium.

In July and August 2011, all Australian state Attorneys-General agreed to instate an R18+ rating for video games, which would be available by the end of 2011.<ref>cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/historic-agreement-on-r18-video-games-20110722-1hs78.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=22 July 2011 | title='Historic agreement' on R18+ video games | access-date=1 March 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922080832/http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/historic-agreement-on-r18-video-games-20110722-1hs78.html | archive-date=22 September 2011 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all </ref> Many games previously refused classification would now fit into the R18+ rating and, if the publisher chose to pay the reclassification fee, would theoretically be able to sell their game in Australia. The date was later changed to allow the rating to be introduced at the beginning of 2013.<ref>Cite web |url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/02/r18-scheduled-to-kick-in-january-2013/#more-490473 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218092547/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/02/r18-scheduled-to-kick-in-january-2013/#more-490473#more-490473 |archive-date=18 February 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all </ref>

With the R18+ rating in place, it is expected fewer video games will be Refused Classification. Games may still be Refused Classification if deemed to contain material unsuitable for R18+ classification, such as depictions of sexual violence or the promotion of illegal drug use, as well as drug use that is related to incentives and rewards. More specifically, games which may be Refused Classification include:

* Detailed instruction or promotion in matters of crime or violence.
* Depiction of rape.
* The promotion or provision of instruction in pedophile activity.
* Descriptions or depictions of child sexual abuse or any other exploitative or offensive descriptions or depictions involving a person who is, or appears to be, a child under 18 years.
* Gratuitous, exploitative or offensive depictions of:
** (i) violence with a very high degree of impact or which are excessively frequent, prolonged or detailed;
** (ii) cruelty or real violence which are very detailed or which have an extremely high impact;
** (iii) sexual violence
* Depictions of practices such as bestiality
* Gratuitous, exploitative or offensive depictions of:
** (i) activity accompanied by fetishes or practices that are offensive or abhorrent;
** (ii) incest fantasies or other fantasies that are offensive or abhorrent

Classification is compulsory, and games refused classification by the ACB are banned for sale, hire or public exhibition, carrying a maximum fine of $275,000 and/or 10 years' jail. It is, however, legal to possess RC games (except in Western Australia and prescribed areas of the Northern Territory).

Material that is refused classification is put on the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service list of prohibited items. Any copies of such games found at the border will be seized,<ref>cite web|title=Frequently asked questions—importing and exporting|url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Guidelines/Pages/FAQ-import-export.aspx|access-date=6 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822101602/http://www.classification.gov.au/Guidelines/Pages/FAQ-import-export.aspx|archive-date=22 August 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all</ref> and the recipient, depending on the number of copies being imported, may receive up to A$110,000 in fines.<ref name="Kozanecki">cite web|first=James|last=Kozanecki|date=15 March 2011|title=Aussie customs to seize Mortal Kombat imports|url=http://au.gamespot.com/pages/news/story.php?sid=6303984|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=2011-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319160323/http://au.gamespot.com/pages/news/story.php?sid=6303984|archive-date=19 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all</ref>

The list depicted below is of games that are either still banned, or were initially banned but have been edited exclusively for Australia. It should be noted that some of these games were banned before the introduction of the R18+ category; if some of these games were to be re-rated today, they would likely receive the R18+ rating. The second list is of games that have been eventually released unedited, rating appealed or the worldwide edition later being released uncut and being identical to other countries.

Due to the licensing of the International Age Rating Coalition software for developers to rate their own game, several hundred games have been banned from various app stores and due to said games being relatively minor they will not be listed here.<ref>Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-30/australia-bans-220-video-games-in-four-months/6582100|title=Australia bans 220 video games in four months|date=2015-06-30|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en-AU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501065707/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-30/australia-bans-220-video-games-in-four-months/6582100|archive-date=1 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all</ref>

 Criticism 
Many activistswho?|date=November 2018, developerswho?|date=November 2018 and gamerswho?|date=November 2018 openly criticise most of the bans the ACB usually puts into place, mostly because of how unconstitutional, sudden and poorly enforced they are.how?|date=November 2018cn|date=November 2018

Many Australianswho?|date=November 2018 see the open resentment of Video Games by most older or middle-aged Australians as the result of vague long-disproved research from the 80s and 90s that video games cause violence being a nearly unanimous social norm with the entire parental demographic at the time.cn|date=November 2018

It is usually easy to circumvent with either a VPN, or buying it from a Digital Marketplace like G2A, GOG.com or Green Man Gaming.cn|date=November 2018

Many scholarswho?|date=November 2018 also believe that this encourages software piracy within the country as well.cn|date=November 2018
