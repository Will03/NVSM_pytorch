Electronic dance music (EDM), also known as dance music, club music, or simply dance,<ref name="Koskoff_44">harvp|Koskoff|2004|p=44</ref> is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves and List of electronic dance music festivals|festivals.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the emergence of Rave music|raving, pirate radios and an upsurge of interest in club culture, EDM achieved widespread mainstream popularity in Europe. In the United States at that time, acceptance of dance culture was not universal; although both Electro (music)|electro and Chicago house music were influential both in Europe and the United States, mainstream media outlets and the record industry remained openly hostile to it.There was also a perceived association between EDM and drug culture, which led governments at state and city level to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave culture.<ref name=guardian-conquered />

Subsequently, in the new millennium, the popularity of EDM increased globally, largely in Australia and the United States. By the early 2010s, the term "electronic dance music" and the initialism "EDM" was being Push–pull strategy#Push–pull music marketing future|pushed by the American music industry and Music journalism|music press in an effort to rebranding|rebrand American rave culture.<ref name=guardian-conquered/> Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including house music|house, techno, trance music|trance, drum and bass, and dubstep, as well as their respective subgenres.<ref>Cite news|url=https://midniteblaster.com/2018/07/09/what-is-edm-music/|title=What is EDM music? - Midnite Blaster|date=2018-07-09|work=Midnite Blaster|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US</ref><ref name=noisey-realgenre>cite web|title=Is EDM a Real Genre?|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/blog/is-edm-a-real-genre|website=Noisey|publisher=Vice|accessdate=25 February 2015</ref><ref>RA Roundtable: EDM in AmericaResident Advisor.

The point is not to provide a genre guide, but to refer people to the "list of electronic music genres" page, and to briefly cover the relationship between the genres and "EDM".-->Stylistic variation within an established EDM genre can lead to the emergence of what is called a subgenre.

European acts Silver Convention, Love & Kisses|Love and Kisses, Munich Machine, and American acts Donna Summer and the Village People were acts that defined the late 1970s Euro disco sound. In 1977, Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte produced "I Feel Love" for Donna Summer. It became the first well-known disco hit to have a completely synthesised backing track. Other disco producers, most famously American producer Tom Moulton, grabbed ideas and techniques from dub music (which came with the increased Jamaican migration to New York City in the seventies) to provide alternatives to the four on the floor style that dominated.<ref name="Billboard.com">cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/search/charts?page=41&f&#91;0&#93;=ts_chart_artistname%3A*donna%20summer*&f&#91;1&#93;=ss_bb_type%3Achart_item&type=2&artist=donna%20summer|title=Chart Search: Billboard|work=billboard.com</ref><ref>cite book

It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic music|electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the "Krautrock" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the New wave music|new wave movement of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.

Early synth-pop pioneers included Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra, and British bands Ultravox, the Human League and Berlin BlondesCitation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; proof needed that they are regarded as pioneers.|date=May 2018. the Human League used monophonic synthesizers to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like Japan (band)|Japan and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and newcomers such as Depeche Mode and Eurythmics. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synth-pop bands such as P-Model, Plastics (band)|Plastics, and Hikashu. The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of Dance music|dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet) in the United States.

In the mid 80s house music thrived on the small Balearic Island of Ibiza, Spain. The Balearic sound was the spirit of the music emerging from the island at that time; the combination of old vinyl rock, pop, reggae, and disco records paired with an “anything goes” attitude made Ibiza a hub of drug-induced musical experimentation.<ref name="boilerroom.tv">Cite news|url=https://boilerroom.tv/balearic-beat/|title=What Is Balearic Beat? – BOILER ROOM|date=2014-07-12|newspaper=BOILER ROOM|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-28</ref> The scene was mainly centered around a club called Amnesia where its resident DJ, Alfredo Fiorito, pioneered Balearic house.<ref name="Warren">Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/12/electronicmusic|title=The birth of rave|last=Warren|first=Emma|date=2007-08-12|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-28</ref> Amnesia became known across Europe and by the mid to late 1980s it was drawing people from all over the continent.<ref name="Amnesia - history">cite web|url=http://www.amnesia.es/history/en|title=Amnesia – history|website=www.amnesia.es|access-date=2016-10-28</ref>

Also in 1988, the Balearic beat|Balearic party vibe associated with Ibiza's DJ Alfredo was transported to London, when Danny Rampling and Paul Oakenfold opened the clubs Shoom and Spectrum, respectively. Both places became synonymous with acid house, and it was during this period that MDMA gained prominence as a party drug. Other important UK clubs included Back to Basics in Leeds, Sheffield's Leadmill and Music Factory, and The Haçienda in Manchester, where Mike Pickering and Graeme Park's spot, Nude, was an important proving ground for American Underground music|underground dance music.refn|harvp|Fikentscher|2000|p=5, in discussing the definition of underground dance music as it relates to post-disco music in America, states that: "The prefix 'underground' does not merely serve to explain that the associated type of music—and its cultural context—are familiar only to a small number of informed persons. Underground also points to the sociological function of the music, framing it as one type of music that in order to have meaning and continuity is kept away, to large degree, from mainstream society, mass media, and those empowered to enforce prevalent moral and aesthetic codes and values."|group=Note<ref>harvp|Rietveld|1998|pp=54–59</ref> The success of house and acid house paved the way for Detroit Techno, a style that was initially supported by a handful of house music clubs in Chicago, New York, and Northern England, with Detroit clubs catching up later.<ref>harvp|Brewster|2006|pp=398–443</ref> The term Techno first came into use after a release of a 10 Records/Virgin Records compilation titled ''Techno: The Dance Sound of Detroit'' in 1988.<ref>Reynolds (1999:71) notes that: "Detroit's music had hitherto reached British ears as a subset of Chicago house; [Neil] Rushton and the Belleville Three decided to fasten on the word techno – a term that had been bandied about but never stressed – in order to define Detroit as a distinct genre."

One of the first Detroit productions to receive wider attention was Derrick May's "Derrick May (musician)#Career|Strings of Life" (1987), which, together with May's previous release, "Nude Photo" (1987), helped raise techno's profile in Europe, especially the UK and Germany, during the 1987–1988 house music boom (see Second Summer of Love).<ref>Unterberger R., Hicks S., Dempsey J, (1999).

Trance is mostly Instrumental music|instrumental, although vocals can be mixed in: typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists, often without a traditional verse/chorus structure. Structured vocal form in trance music forms the basis of the vocal trance subgenre, which has been described as "grand, soaring, and operatic" and "ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths".<ref name="remixing guide">Hawkins, Erik (2004).

Several subgenres are crossovers with other major genres of electronic music. For instance, Tech trance is a mixture of trance and techno, and Vocal trance "combines [trance's] progressive elements with pop music".<ref name="tranceexperience" /> The dream trance genre originated in the mid-1990s, with its popularity then led by Robert Miles.

AllMusic states on progressive trance: "the progressive wing of the trance crowd led directly to a more commercial, chart-oriented sound, since trance had never enjoyed much chart action in the first place. Emphasizing the smoother sound of Eurodance or house (and occasionally more reminiscent of Jean-Michel Jarre than Basement Jaxx), Progressive Trance became the sound of the world's dance floors by the end of the millennium. Critics ridiculed its focus on predictable breakdowns and relative lack of skill to beat-mix, but progressive trance was caned by the hottest DJ."<ref name="AMProgTrance">cite web|title=Progressive Trance|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/progressive-trance-ma0000011914|website=AllMusic</ref>

|format=Ogg
By the early 1990s, a style of music developed within the rave scene that had an identity distinct from American house and techno. This music, much like Hip-hop music|hip-hop before it, combined sampled syncopated beats or break beats, other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. Relative to earlier styles of dance music such as house and techno, so called 'rave music' tended to emphasise bass sounds and use faster tempos, or Tempo|beats per minute (BPM). This subgenre was known as "hardcore" rave, but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo break beats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as "jungle techno", a genre influenced by Jack Smooth and Basement Records, and later just "jungle", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on pirate radio in United Kingdom|Britain. It is important to note when discussing the history of drum & bass that prior to jungle, rave music was getting faster and more experimental.

By 1994, jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music (often referred to as junglists) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the raggamuffin music|raggamuffin sound, dancehall, Rapping|MC chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, Jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>Cite book

Dubstep
Main|Dubstep
Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London in the late 1990s. It is generally characterized by sparse, syncopation|syncopated rhythmic Drum pattern|patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub-bass frequencies. The style emerged as an offshoot of UK garage, drawing on a lineage of related styles such as 2-step garage|2-step, dub reggae, Oldschool jungle|jungle,  broken beat, and grime (music genre)|grime.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/style/dubstep-ma0000004465 AllMusic - Dubstep] "Absorbed and transfigured elements of techno, drum'n' bass and dub"</ref><ref name=Reynolds>Reynolds, S.(2012),''Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture,'' Perseus Books; Reprint edition (5 Jan 2012), pages&nbsp;511–516, (ISBN|978-1-59376-407-4).</ref> In the United Kingdom the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the Sound system (Jamaican)|Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s.<ref name=Reynolds /><ref>[http://uncarved.org/dub/splash/ The Big Big Sound System Splashdown], New Musical Express, 21 February 1981, ISSN|0028-6362.</ref>

The earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998, and were usually featured as B-sides of 2-step garage single releases. These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of breakbeat and drum and bass into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the "Forward" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term "dubstep" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and Grime music|grime.<ref>IMO Records [http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ "Hatcha Biography"] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122021/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ |date=12 January 2012 , ''IMO Records'', London, 17 October 2011.

=Criticism of over commercialization=
Following the popularization of EDM in America a number of producers and DJs, including Carl Cox, Steve Lawler, and Markus Schulz, raised concerns that the perceived over-commercialisation of dance music had impacted the "art" of DJing. Cox saw the "press-play" approach taken by newer EDM DJs as unrepresentative of what he called a "DJ ethos".<ref name=wsj-dumbingdown/> Writing in ''Mixmag'', DJ Tim Sheridan argued that "push-button DJs" who use auto-sync and play pre-recorded sets of "obvious hits" resulted in a situation overtaken by "the spectacle, money and the showbiz".<ref name="mixmag-killing">cite news|title=Is EDM killing the art of DJing? |url=http://www.mixmag.net/words/features/is-edm-killing-the-art-of-djing |work=Mixmag |accessdate=7 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529084448/http://www.mixmag.net/words/features/is-edm-killing-the-art-of-djing |archivedate=29 May 2014 |df= </ref>

Some house producers openly admitted that "commercial" EDM needed further differentiation and creativity.

After years of rapid growth, the American popular EDM market started to wane in 2016 when a number of artists famous for producing so-called 'big room' electro-house started to diversify stylistically. This development was directly referenced by two such DJs - David Guetta and Showtek - in a techno-influenced single released in April 2016 titled 'The Death of EDM'.<ref>https://www.ministryofsound.com/posts/articles/2016/june/david-guettas-new-track-is-worse-for-techno-than-it-is-for-edm/</ref>

International popularisation
In May 2015, the International Music Summit's Business Report estimated that the global electronic music industry had reached nearly $6.9 billion in value; the count included music sales, events revenue (including nightclubs and festivals), the sale of DJ equipment and software, and other sources of revenue. The report also identified several emerging markets for electronic dance music, including East Asia, India, and South Africa, credited primarily to investment by domestic, as well as American and European interests. A number of major festivals also began expanding into Latin America.<ref name=thump-edmworldwide>cite web|title=Electronic Music Industry Now Worth Close to $7 Billion Amid Slowing Growth|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/electronic-music-industry-now-worth-close-to-7-billion-amid-slowing-growth|website=Thump|publisher=Vice Media|accessdate=17 January 2016</ref>

China is a market where EDM had initially made relatively few inroads; although promoters believed that the mostly instrumental music would remove a metaphorical language barrier, the growth of EDM in China was hampered by the lack of a prominent rave culture in the country as in other regions, as well as the popularity of domestic C-pop|Chinese pop over foreign artists. Former Universal Music executive Eric Zho, inspired by the US growth, made the first significant investments in electronic music in China, including the organisation of Shanghai's inaugural Storm festival in 2013, the reaching of a title sponsorship deal for the festival with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser brand, a local talent search, and organising collaborations between EDM producers and Chinese singers, such as Avicii and Wang Leehom's "Lose Myself". In the years following, a larger number of EDM events began to appear in China, and Storm itself was also preceded by a larger number of pre-parties in 2014 than its inaugural year. A new report released during the inaugural International Music Summit China in October 2015 revealed that the Chinese EDM industry was experiencing modest gains, citing the larger number of events (including new major festival brands such as Modern Sky and YinYang), a 6% increase in the sales of electronic music in the country, and the significant size of the overall market.

The term "electronic dance music" (EDM) was used in the United States as early as 1985, although the term "dance music" did not catch on as a blanket term <sup>Electronic dance music#cite note-99|[95].</sup> Writing in ''The Guardian'', journalist Simon Reynolds noted that the American music industry's adoption of the term EDM in the late 2000s was an attempt to re-brand US "rave culture" and differentiate it from the 1990s rave scene. In the UK, "dance music" or "dance" are more common terms for EDM.<sup>Electronic dance music#cite note-Definition-4|[4]</sup>What is widely perceived to be "club music" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM. Similarly, "electronic dance music" can mean different things to different people. Both "club music" and "EDM" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).<sup>Electronic dance music#cite note-genres-100|[96]</sup> Until the late 1990s, when the larger US music industry created music charts for "dance" (''Billboard'' magazine has maintained a "dance" chart since 1974 and it continues to this day).<sup>Electronic dance music#cite note-atlantic-96|[93]</sup> In July 1995, Nervous Records and ''Project X Magazine'' hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the "Electronic Dance Music Awards".<sup>Electronic dance music#cite note-98|[Note 4]</sup>

Electronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a recording studio with specialized equipment such as sampler (musical instrument)|samplers, synthesizers, effects units and MIDI controllers all set up to interact with one another using the MIDI protocol. In the genre's early days, hardware electronic musical instruments were used and the focus in production was mainly on manipulating MIDI data as opposed to manipulating audio signals. Since the late 1990s the use of software has increased. Many modern electronic music production studio generally consists of a computer running a digital audio workstation (DAW), with various plug-in (computing)|plug-ins installed such as software synthesizers and effects units, which are controlled with a MIDI controller such as a MIDI keyboard.

In the 1980s, electronic dance music was often played at illegal underground rave parties held in secret locations, for example, warehouses, abandoned aircraft hangars, fields and any other large, open areas. In the 1990s and 2000s, aspects of the underground rave culture of the 1980s and early 1990s began to evolve into legitimate, organized EDM concerts and music festivals|festivals. Major festivals often feature a large number of acts representing various EDM genres spread across multiple stages. Festivals have placed a larger emphasis on visual spectacles as part of their overall experiences, including elaborate stage designs with underlying thematics, complex lighting systems, laser shows, and pyrotechnics. Rave#Attire|Rave fashion also evolved among attendees, which ''The Guardian'' described as progressing from the 1990s "kandi raver" to "[a] slick and sexified yet also kitschy-surreal image midway between Venice Beach and Cirque du Soleil, Willy Wonka and a Pride parade|gay pride parade."<ref name=guardian-conquered/><ref name=wsj-dumbingdown/><ref name=da-edclv>cite news |title=An Electric Desert Experience: The 2014 EDC Las Vegas Phenomenon |url= http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2014/06/edc |author = Valerie Lee | date = June 27, 2014 | work =Dancing Astronaut </ref> These events differed from underground raves by their organized nature, often taking place at major venues, and measures to ensure the health and safety of attendees.<ref name=lat-fataltoll>cite news |title=A fatal toll on concertgoers as raves boost cities' income| url= http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-coliseum-rave-deaths-20130203-story.html#page=1| work =Los Angeles Times |date = February 3, 2013</ref> MTV's Rawley Bornstein described electronic music as "the new rock and roll",<ref name=mainstream>Lisa Rose, [http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/new_jersey_basks_in_the_summer.html "N.J. basks in the glow of the brave new rave: Electronic dance festivals go mainstream"], ''Newark Star Ledger'', May 16, 2012.</ref> as has Lollapalooza organizer Perry Ferrell.<ref>cite news | author =Sarah Maloy |title=Lollapalooza's Perry Farrell on EDM and Elevating the Aftershow: Video |url =http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/480607/lollapaloozas-perry-farrell-on-edm-and-elevating-the| work =Billboard | date= August 4, 2012</ref>

File:Ecstasy monogram.jpg|thumb|Pictured above is what the drug ecstasy commonly looks like. Although there are many different shapes or forms.
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as ecstasy, "E", or "Molly", is often considered the drug of choice within the rave culture and is also used at clubs, festivals and house party|house parties.<ref name="pmid22392347">cite journal |vauthors=Carvalho M, Carmo H, Costa VM, Capela JP, Pontes H, Remião F, Carvalho F, Bastos Mde L | title = Toxicity of amphetamines: an update | journal = Arch. Toxicol. | volume = 86 | issue = 8 | pages = 1167–1231 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22392347 | doi = 10.1007/s00204-012-0815-5 | quote = MDMA has become a popular recreational drug of abuse at nightclubs and rave or techno parties, where it is combined with intense physical activity (''all-night dancing''), crowded conditions (aggregation), high ambient temperature, poor hydration, loud noise, and is commonly taken together with other stimulant ''club drugs'' and/or alcohol (Parrott 2006; Von Huben et al. 2007; Walubo and Seger 1999). This combination is probably the main reason why it is generally seen an increase in toxicity events at rave parties since all these factors are thought to induce or enhance the toxicity (particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.&nbsp;... Another report showed that MDMA users displayed multiple regions of grey matter reduction in the neocortical, bilateral cerebellum, and midline brainstem brain regions, potentially accounting for previously reported neuropsychiatric impairments in MDMA users (Cowan et al. 2003). Neuroimaging techniques, like PET, were used in combination with a 5-HTT ligand in human ''ecstasy'' users, showing lower density of brain 5-HTT sites (McCann et al. 1998, 2005, 2008). Other authors correlate the 5-HTT reductions with the memory deficits seen in humans with a history of recreational MDMA use (McCann et al. 2008). A recent study prospectively assessed the sustained effects of ''ecstasy'' use on the brain in novel MDMA users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. The authors concluded that low MDMA dosages can produce sustained effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and possibly axonal damage (de Win et al. 2008).</ref> In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the "rave" setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects.<ref>cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415923736|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tGaRJiXe74UC&pg=PA81&dq=Generation+Ecstasy+MDMA#v=onepage&q=Generation%20Ecstasy%20MDMA&f=false</ref> Another drug para-Methoxyamphetamine (4-MA) also known as pink ecstasy, PMA, "Death" or "Dr. Death", it is similar to MDMA but they can take up to an hour to produce effects, which can result in hyperthermia and subsequently, organ failure.

MDMA is occasionally known for being taken in conjunction with psychedelic drugs. The more common combinations include MDMA combined with LSD, MDMA combined with N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT, MDMA with psilocybin mushrooms, and MDMA with the disassociative drug ketamine. Many users use mentholated products while taking MDMA for its cooling sensation while experiencing the drug's effects. Examples include menthol cigarettes, Vicks VapoRub, NyQuil,<ref>cite web|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/DirReports/DirRep500/DirectorReport5.html |title=Director's Report to the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse |publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse |date=May 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826051026/http://drugabuse.gov/DirReports/DirRep500/DirectorReport5.html |archivedate=August 26, 2009 </ref> and throat lozenge|lozenges.

In September 2016, the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina banned all electronic music events, pending future legislation, after five drug-related deaths and four injuries at a Time Warp Festival event in the city in April 2016. The ban forced electronic band Kraftwerk to cancel a planned concert in the city, despite arguing that there were dissimilarities between a festival and their concerts.<ref name="billboard-kraftwerkban">cite web|title=Kraftwerk Can't Play Buenos Aires Concert Due to Electronic Music Ban: Report|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7573336/buenos-aires-kraftwerk-concert-electronic-music-ban|website=Billboard|accessdate=5 January 2017</ref><ref name="guardian-buenosairesban">cite web|title=Buenos Aires bans electronic music festivals after five deaths|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/26/buenos-aires-bans-electronic-music-festivals-after-five-deaths|website=The Guardian|accessdate=5 January 2017</ref>
