The International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA), formed in 1984, is a private sector coalition of seven trade associations representing U.S. companies that produce Copyright law of the United States|copyright-protected material, including computer software, films, television programs, music, books, and journals (electronic and print media). It seeks to strengthen international copyright protection and enforcement by working with the U.S. government, foreign governments, and private-sector representatives.<ref name=iipa-aboutus>[http://www.iipawebsite.com/aboutiipa.html About IIPA]</ref>

Activities

IIPA was the principal representative of the entertainment industry in assisting the U.S. government in the World Trade Organization (WTO) TRIPS negotiations, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations, and at the Diplomatic Conference leading to the completion in 1996 of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) "Internet" treatiesâ€”i.e., the WIPO Copyright Treaty|Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty|Performances and Phonograms Treaty.

IIPA has also worked with the U.S. government in drafting Intellectual Property Rights Chapters of Free-trade area|free trade agreements. It participates in policy development in copyright and enforcement issues in  bilateral and regional initiatives such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). IIPA participates in trade actions brought under trade laws like the Generalized System of Preferences and other trade preference programs.Citation needed|date=March 2009
