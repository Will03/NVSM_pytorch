Internet censorship in Australia currently consists of a regulatory regime under which the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has the power to enforce content restrictions on Internet content hosted within Australia, and maintain a "black-list" of overseas websites which is then provided for use in filtering software. The restrictions focus primarily on child pornography, sexual violence, and other illegal activities, compiled as a result of a consumer complaints process. In 2009, the OpenNet Initiative found no evidence of Internet filtering in Australia, but due to legal restrictions ONI does not test for filtering of child pornography<ref name=ONISS-Nov2011>[http://opennet.net/research/data Filtering Data], OpenNet Initiative, 8 November 2011</ref><ref name=ONIRO-AustraliaAndNewZealand>[http://opennet.net/research/australia-and-new-zealand "ONI Regional Overview: Australia and New Zealand"], OpenNet Initiative, March 2010</ref> or cyberbullying.

In October 2008, a policy extending Internet censorship to a system of mandatory filtering of overseas websites which are, or potentially would be, "refused classification" (RC) in Australia was proposed. Australia is classified as "under surveillance" by Reporters Without Borders due to the proposed legislation.<ref name=RWBEnemies>[http://march12.rsf.org/i/Report_EnemiesoftheInternet_2012.pdf ''Internet Enemies''] Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323215225/http://march12.rsf.org/i/Report_EnemiesoftheInternet_2012.pdf |date=23 March 2012 , Reporters Without Borders (Paris), 12&nbsp;March 2012</ref> If enacted, the legislation would require Internet service providers to censor access to such content for all users.

In June 2015, the country passed an amendment which will allow the court-ordered censorship of websites deemed to primarily facilitate copyright infringement.

In December 2016, the Federal Court of Australia ordered more than fifty ISP's to censor 5 sites that infringe on the Copyright Act after rights holders, Roadshow Films, Foxtel, Disney, Paramount, Columbia and the 20th Century Fox companies filed a lawsuit. The sites barred include The Pirate Bay, Torrentz, TorrentHound, IsoHunt and SolarMovie.

A collection of both federal and state laws apply to Internet content in Australia.

=Federal law=
While the Australian constitution does not explicitly provide for freedom of speech or press, the High Court has held that a right to freedom of expression is implied in the constitution, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press. There were no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government routinely monitored e-mail or Internet chat rooms. Individuals and groups can and do engage in the expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?dynamic_load_id=186260#section2a "Freedom of Speech and Press" in ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011: Australia''], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 25 May 2012</ref>

Under this regime, if a complaint is issued about material "broadcast" on the Internet the ACMA is allowed to examine the material under the guidelines for film and video.

The content is deemed to be "prohibited" where it is (or in ACMA's judgement likely would be):
* Refused classification, or classified X18+
* Classified R18+, and not protected by an Adult Verification System|adult verification system
* Classified MA15+ and not protected by an adult verification system, where the user has paid to access the content.
* Cyberbullying

Where content is deemed to be prohibited, the ACMA is empowered to issue local sites with a takedown notice under which the content must be removed; failure to do so can result in fines of up to $11,000 per day.<ref name=banned_links_11000>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/03/17/1237054787635.html?page=fullpage Banned hyperlinks could cost you $11,000 a day (SMH)]</ref> If the site is hosted outside Australia, the content in question is added to a blacklist of banned URLs.

In New South Wales, Internet censorship legislation was introduced in 2001 which criminalises online material which is unsuitable for minors. In 2002, the New South Wales Standing Committee on Social Issues issued a report recommending that the legislation be repealed, and in response the Government of New South Wales|New South Wales government stated that the legislation "will be neither commenced nor repealed" until after the review of the Commonwealth Internet censorship legislation had been completed.<ref>[http://www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/nswbill.html New South Wales Internet Censorship Bill 2001]</ref>

Proposed mandatory filtering legislation
In October 2008, the governing Australian Labor Party proposed extending Internet censorship to a system of mandatory filtering of overseas websites which are, or potentially would be, "refused classification" (RC) in Australia. As of June 2010, legislation to enact the proposed policy had not been drafted.<ref name=itwire_draft_legislation_delayed>[http://www.itwire.com/it-policy-news/regulation/37640-internet-filter-draft-legislation-delayed Internet filter draft legislation delayed (iTwIRE)] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323053007/http://www.itwire.com/it-policy-news/regulation/37640-internet-filter-draft-legislation-delayed |date=23 March 2010</ref> The proposal has generated substantial opposition, with a number of concerns being raised by opponents and only a few groups strongly supporting the policy.<ref name=itwire_draft_legislation_delayed/><ref name="smh.com.au"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="rudd-retreats-passing-legislation"/>

In November 2010, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE) released a document indicating that the earliest date any new legislation could reach parliament was mid-2013.<ref name=SGSM-Nov2010>[http://www.dbcde.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/131275/Strategy_papers.pdf "10.

=Terminology=
Proposed Australian laws on Internet censorship are sometimes referred to as the Great Firewall of Australia, Rabbit Proof Firewall<ref>[http://stilgherrian.com/politics/jim-wallaces-pro-censorship-lies-and-distortions/ Jim Wallace's pro-censorship lies and distortions]</ref> (a reference to the Australian Rabbit-proof fence), Firewall Australia or Great Firewall Reef (a reference to Great Barrier Reef and the Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|Great Firewall of China).<ref>[http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/6009/ Tear down Australia's Great Firewall Reef (spiked)]</ref>

The proposed filter has been referred to in the media variously as an Internet filter and a world Wide Web|web filter. The worldwide-web is a myriad of Web page|software documents containing hyperlink|pointers to each other, hosted on Web server|server computers around the world. The Internet is the physical network used to convey requests from users' computers to these servers and responses from the servers back to the users.

The proposed filter only monitors certain port (computer networking)|ports specific to conveying web traffic. As it aims to monitor the majority of web traffic, it is appropriately referred to as a web filter. As it is agnostic of the majority (99.99%) of Internet protocol suite|other connections a user's computer might establish with other computers on the Internet, it is something of a misnomer to refer to it as an Internet filter.

Since the proposed filter is situated at the Internet service provider (the junction between users and the Internet at large), introducing such a filter cannot possibly slow down the Internet itself. It can only (potentially) slow down access to the Internet by users of that ISP. Ignoring Load (computing)|load considerations, communication speed across the Internet for any non-web traffic would be unaffected.

In the same year, the Liberal Party of Victoria<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/cfacga1995596/ (Victoria) CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) (ENFORCEMENT) ACT 1995]</ref> and Western Australia<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/cfacgea1996596/ (Western Australia) CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) ENFORCEMENT ACT 1996]</ref> State Governments and Country Liberal Party of Northern Territory Government<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/copfacga508/ (Northern Territory) CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) ENFORCEMENT ACT 1996]</ref> implemented changes to law that allows censoring online content as part of expanding the scope of classification material.<ref name=rogerclarke>[http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/Tebbutt.html States to Censor Online Services]</ref> Queensland introduced similar legislation at the time, but a case of an ISP systems administrator showed it did not apply to online services when the judge ruled that the act did not apply.<ref>Cite web |url=http://libertus.net/censor/rdocs/qcaseone.html |title=States to Censor Online Services |access-date=28 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620020300/http://libertus.net/censor/rdocs/qcaseone.html |archive-date=20 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all </ref>

In 1996, the Labor Party of New South Wales State Government attempted to propose a standard Internet censorship legislation for all Australian States and Territories. The legislation would have made ISPs responsible for their customers' communications. But the proposed legislation attracted widespread protests<ref>[https://www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/stop96.html STOP! Campaign]</ref> and has since been postponed in favour of a national scheme.<ref>[http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/AFR960711.html Censor's hands of the Internet]</ref>

In 1997, following the previous Federal Government, the Liberal Party further commissioned inquiries into a variety of online censorship schemes, including self-imposed censorship by ISPs.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031124104143/http://www.dcita.gov.au/Article/0%2C%2C0_1-2_1-4_10366%2C00.html National framework for on-line content regulation - Media Release]</ref><ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate_Committees?url=comstand_ctte/online3/contents.htm REPORT ON REGULATION OF COMPUTER ON-LINE SERVICES PART 3]</ref>

By 1999, the then Federal Government attempted to introduce an Internet censorship regime. Some have pointed out it was to gain support from minority senators to assist with the sale of Telstra and introduction of Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST,<ref name=pornwars>[http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/communications/soa/Porn-wars-episode-II/0,130061791,120273369,00.htm Porn Wars, Episode 2 (zdnet Australia)]</ref> but as noted above, this censorship plan had been in development for several years.<ref>Cite web |url=http://libertus.net/censor/debate/analyses99.html |title=Ln: Analyses & Commentaries on Australian Censorship Laws, 1999 |access-date=28 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108215738/http://libertus.net/censor/debate/analyses99.html#bsabkgd |archive-date=8 January 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all </ref>

In 2001, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO was commissioned to examine Internet content filtering. The report focused primarily on evaluating the effectiveness of client-side filtering schemes (which were generally ineffective), but also discussed some of the difficulties with ISP-based filtering<ref>Report prepared by CSIRO for NetAlert.

In March 2003, the Fairfax papers ''The Age'' and the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' reported the results of a survey taken by The Australia Institute of 200 children, which found that many of them had found pornography on the Internet. Over the next few days was a storm of media and political attention, and there were calls for finer Internet filters and tougher censorship laws. Analysis of the report showed little new material, and only 2% of girls had admitted being exposed to pornography, while the figure for boys was 38%; such a difference between boys and girls would seem to indicate that inadvertent exposure was rare, contrary to the conclusions of the report. After the controversy died down, no new action resulted from the new report, media attention, or political speeches.<ref name=pornwars/>

In 2003, the Labor Party opposed filtering at the ISP level, with Labor Senator Kate Lundy stating <blockquote> "Unfortunately, such a short memory regarding the debate in 1999 about Internet content has led the coalition to already offer support for greater censorship by actively considering proposals for unworkable, quick fixes that involve filtering the Internet at the ISP level."<ref name=deadend>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/biztech/web-censorship-plan-heads-towards-a-dead-end/2009/02/26/1235237810486.html?page=fullpage Web censorship plan heads towards a dead end (SMH)]</ref> </blockquote>

Shortly before the Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election, two political parties issued new policies on Internet censorship. The Australian Labor Party's policy involved voluntary adherence by users. The Family First Party released a far stricter policy of mandatory filtering at the Internet service provider level.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.familyfirst.org.au/documents/INTERNETPORNOGRAPHYANDCHILDREN.pdf|format=PDF|title=Internet Pornography And Children|publisher=Family First Party|accessdate=3 March 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414012251/http://www.familyfirst.org.au/documents/INTERNETPORNOGRAPHYANDCHILDREN.pdf|archivedate=14 April 2008|df=dmy-all</ref>

The Australian Family Association petitioned the Australian Federal Government in 2004 to further restrict access by children to pornography|pornographic material via the Internet. The petition was submitted in December 2004.

On 21 March 2006, the Labor Party committed to requiring all ISPs to implement a mandatory Block (Internet)|Internet blocking system applicable to “all households, and to schools and other public Internet points” to “prevent users from accessing any content that has been identified as prohibited by the Australian Communications and Media Authority”.<ref name=efa_mandatory_plan>cite web|url=http://www.efa.org.au/Issues/Censor/mandatoryblocking.html#23|title=Labor’s Mandatory ISP Internet Blocking Plan|publisher=Electronic Frontiers Australia|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008</ref>

On the same day, the then communications minister Helen Coonan stated that to <blockquote> “filter the Internet will only result in #Terminology|slowing down the Internet for every Australian without effectively protecting children from inappropriate and offensive content”<ref name=efa_mandatory_plan/> </blockquote>

=Political party policies, positions and statements=

Labor Party
On 31 December 2007, Stephen Conroy announced the Federal Government's intention to introduce an ISP-based filter to censor "inappropriate material" from the Internet to protect children. In this announcement, it was stated that adults could opt out of the filter to receive uncensored access to the Internet.<ref>cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/12/31/2129471.htm|title=Conroy announces mandatory internet filters to protect children|publisher=ABC News (Australia)|ABC News |date=31 December 2007|accessdate=3 March 2008</ref>

In May 2008, the government commenced an $82 million "cybersafety plan" which included an additional mandatory filter with no opt-out provision. This ISP-based filter aims to stop adults from downloading content that is illegal to possess in Australia, such as child pornography or materials related to terrorism.<ref name=nytimes>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/technology/internet/12cyber.html?_r=1 Proposed Filter Criticized in Australia] ''New York Times'', December 12, 2008.</ref>

In March 2009, Stephen Conroy dismissed suggestions that the Government would use the filter to crack down on political dissent as "conspiracy theories".  He stated that the filter would only be used to remove "refused classification" (RC) content, using the same rationale as existing television, radio and print publications, and that the Senate could be relied upon to provide rigorous assessment of any proposed legislation.<ref>Cite web |url=http://www.itnews.com.au/News/98679,conroy-requests-faith-in-net-filter-scheme.aspx |title=Conroy requests faith in net filter scheme (iTnews) |access-date=15 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315180827/http://itnews.com.au/News/98679,conroy-requests-faith-in-net-filter-scheme.aspx |archive-date=15 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all </ref> However, Labor's policy statement on the issue<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080721215853/http://www.alp.org.au/download/labors_plan_for_cyber_safety.pdf Labor's Plan For Cyber Safety]</ref> contradicts this.  It is also contrary to an earlier ministerial release in 2008.<ref>[http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2008/060 Minister welcomes advances in internet filtering technology] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710191841/http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2008/060 |date=10 July 2009</ref>

The most recent explanation of the government's position on this issue is provided on the ministry website.<ref>[http://www.dbcde.gov.au/all_funding_programs_and_support/cybersafety_plan/internet_service_provider_isp_filtering Internet Service Provider (ISP) Filtering (accessed 1 April 2010)] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028000919/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/all_funding_programs_and_support/cybersafety_plan/internet_service_provider_isp_filtering |date=28 October 2009</ref> This clearly states that only ISP-level filtering of (designated) ''refused classification'' (RC) material will be ''mandatory'' under their policy. However, ISP's will be ''encouraged'' to offer ISP-level filtering of 'adult content' as an ''optional'' (commercial) service to their customers. Such an optional extra service is aimed at parents trying to protect their children from 'undesirable' content that would otherwise be available, because it would not be RC (e.g., it might receive a classification of "R").

Labor Senator Kate Lundy said in January 2010 that she is lobbying within the party for an "opt-out" filter, describing it as the "least worst" option.<ref>[http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Tough-filter-campaign-ahead-Black/0,130061744,339300429,00.htm Tough filter campaign ahead (ZDnet)]</ref> In February 2010 she said she would propose the opt-out option when the filtering legislation goes before caucus.<ref>[http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/lundy-calls-for-net-filter-optout/1760186.aspx Lundy calls for net filter opt-out (Canberra Times)] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227184031/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/lundy-calls-for-net-filter-optout/1760186.aspx |date=27 February 2010</ref>

Stephen Conroy has stated that 85% of Internet Service Providers, including Telstra, Optus, iPrimus, and iiNet, welcome the Internet filter.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/filter-goes-ahead-regardless-20100529-wmg7.html Filter goes ahead regardless (smh)]</ref>  In response, Steve Dalby, iiNet's chief regulatory officer, stated that iiNet as a company does not support the Internet filter, and never has.<ref>[http://www.iinet.net.au/filtering/what-we-really-think.html What we really think (iiNet)]</ref>

On 9 July 2010, Stephen Conroy announced that any mandatory filtering would be delayed until at least 2011.<ref>cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/conroy-backs-down-on-net-filters-20100709-10381.html?autostart=1|title=Conroy backs down on net filters|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 July 2010|accessdate=10 July 2010 | first=Asher |last=Moses</ref>

On 9 November 2012, Stephen Conroy shelved the proposed mandatory filter legislation in favour of existing legislation, touting that it was successful in compelling the largest ISPs to adopt a filter. As a result, 90% of Australian Internet users are censored from accessing some web-based content.<ref name=ISPFiltering-November2012-aa>[http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2012/180 "Child abuse material blocked online, removing need for legislation"] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201055500/http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2012/180 |date=1 February 2013, Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, 9 November 2012</ref>

The Liberal/Nationals Coalition
In February 2009, then opposition communications spokesman Nick Minchin obtained independent legal advice confirming that a mandatory censorship regime would require new legislation.<ref name=deadend/> In March 2009, after the ACMA blacklist was leaked and iiNet withdrew from the filtering trials, he stated that Stephen Conroy was "completely botching the implementation of this filtering policy".<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2008/s2524308.htm Opposition says Government is botching internet filter trial (ABC)]</ref>

In March 2010, shadow treasurer Joe Hockey attacked the filter, saying "What we have in the government's Internet filtering proposals is a scheme that is likely to be unworkable in practice. But more perniciously it is a scheme that will create the infrastructure for government censorship on a broader scale".<ref name=hockey>Cite web |url=http://www.itwire.com/it-industry-news/strategy/37527-hockey-slams-unworkable-internet-filter |title=Hockey slams "unworkable" Internet filter (itWire) |access-date=15 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408223335/http://www.itwire.com/it-industry-news/strategy/37527-hockey-slams-unworkable-internet-filter |archive-date=8 April 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all </ref> During the 2010 Federal Election, Liberal communications spokesman Tony Smith announced that "a Coalition government will not introduce a mandatory ISP level filter", with Joe Hockey also announcing an intention to vote against the policy if Labor is re-elected.<ref name=tonysmith>[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/coalition-to-dump-flawed-internet-filter-20100805-11kmv.html Coalition to dump 'flawed' internet filter]</ref> This followed the 2010 Federal Conference of the National Party of Australia|National Party passing a motion proposed by the Young Nationals to "oppose any mandatory ISP-level internet censorship".<ref>[http://www.zdnet.com.au/national-party-says-no-to-filter-339303984.htm National Party says no to filter]</ref>

In November 2012, Coalition Communications spokesman welcomed the proposed legislation being dropped as it endangered freedom and Internet performance. However, some Coalition members voiced concern, citing support for a mandatory filter to protect children and families but will not propose it citing lack of political support at the time.<ref name=Coalition-filter>[http://www.afr.com/p/national/coalition_split_by_web_filter_backflip_fSk6BhMl7trpdO2mNDglHN Conroy's scrapped internet filter missed the point on online safety: Coalition]</ref> The Coalition have proposed an "eSafety commissioner" to take down undesirable content from the Internet as a means to protect children.<ref name=Coalition-safety>[http://delimiter.com.au/2012/11/19/coalition-calls-for-kids-e-safety-commissioner/ Coalition calls for kids’ e-safety commissioner]</ref> It was met with criticism as a duplication of current government efforts and "difficult and expensive" to implement.

In September 2013, two days before the federal election, the Coalition announced they would introduce an opt-out filter for all Internet connections, including both fixed line and mobile devices. This has since been retracted as "poorly worded" in a statement from Malcolm Turnbull, who said, "The correct position is that the Coalition will encourage mobile phone and Internet service providers to make available software which parents can choose to install on their own devices to protect their children from inappropriate material."<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-05/no-internet-filter-says-turnbull/4939156 "Malcolm Turnbull says Coalition will not introduce opt-out internet filter after earlier supporting it"], Matthew Grimson, ABC News, 5 September 2013. Retrieved 5 September 2013.</ref>

The Greens
The Greens do not support the filter, and Greens senator Scott Ludlam predicts that due to obstruction in the Senate, the legislation will not be introduced until after the next federal election.<ref name=hockey />

At the end of 2008, he asked questions in parliament related to the filtering trial, for which the Government provided answers in January 2009:<ref name=deafening_silence />
* When asked about the stated public demand for Internet filtering, the government responded that the filtering was an election commitment
* The web filter would be easy to bypass using technological measures
* 674 out of 1,370 censored sites on the mandatory list relate to child pornography; 506 sites would be classified as R18+ or X18+, despite the fact that such content is legal to view in Australia. The remaining 190 sites from this number on the blacklist can be viewed at the full revealed blacklists on WikiLeaks.

Ludlam believes that the Labor party may have hit a wall of "technical impossibility", and the filter does not suit its purpose:

<blockquote>"This isn't a great advertisement for the workability of any large scale scheme. The proposal has always been unpopular, now perhaps the Government is starting to come to grips with what the industry has been saying all along: if your policy objective is to protect children on-line, this is not the way to go about it."<ref name=deafening_silence/></blockquote>

Despite their lack of support for the filter, The Greens preselected Clive Hamilton, whose think-tank The Australia Institute first suggested an ISP-based Internet filter,<ref name=pornwars/> for the by-election in the seat of Division of Higgins|Higgins.

Independents and minor parties
In October 2008, Family First senator Senator Steve Fielding was reported to support the censorship of hardcore pornography and fetish material under the government's plans to filter access to the web.<ref>cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/10/27/1224955916155.html |title=Net filters may block porn and gambling sites |author=Asher Moses |accessdate=31 March 2008 |date=27 August 2008 |work=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Media |location=Melbourne</ref> A Family First spokeswoman Who|date=November 2009 confirmed that the party wants X rating|X-rated content banned for everyone, including adults.

A spokesman for independent senator Nick Xenophon said: <blockquote> "should the filtering plan go ahead, he would look to use it to block Australians from accessing overseas online casino sites, which are illegal to run in Australia".<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/biz-tech/net-filters-may-block-porn-and-gambling-sites-20090616-ce9y.html Net filters may block porn and gambling sites (SMH)]</ref> </blockquote> Senator Xenophon has, however, stated that he has serious concerns about the plan, and in February 2009 withdrew all support, stating that "the more evidence that's come out, the more questions there are on this". He believes that money would be better spent educating parents and cracking peer-to-peer groups used by paedophiles.<ref name=deadend/><ref>cite web |url=http://media.mytalk.com.au/3AW/AUDIO/291008_Internet_Filter.wma |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110607/http://media.mytalk.com.au/3AW/AUDIO/291008_Internet_Filter.wma |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all</ref>

A political party associated with the Eros Association, the Australian Sex Party, was launched in November 2008 and plans to campaign on issues including censorship and the federal government's promised web filter.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,24655931-421,00.html Sex industry is launching a new political party]</ref> In 2014, the party won a seat in the Victorian Legislative Council.

=Two blacklists=
As of October 2008, the plan includes two blacklists, the first used to filter "illegal" content, and the second used to filter additional content unsuitable for children. The first filter will be mandatory for all users of the Internet, while the second filter allows opting out. The government will not release details of the content on either list,<ref>[http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/10/13/no-opt-out-filtered-internet No opt-out of filtered Internet] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209084407/http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/10/13/no-opt-out-filtered-internet |date=9 December 2009 Darren Pauli, Computerworld|Computerworld Australia, October 2008. Reprinted by The Industry Standard</ref> but has stated that the mandatory filter would include at least 10,000 sites, and include both the ACMA blacklist and UK's Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) blacklist. In December 2008 the IWF list caused problems when the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was added to the list, as it prevented many people in the UK from Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|being able to edit Wikipedia.

The ACMA definitions of "prohibited content" give some idea of what could potentially be blacklisted. Online content prohibited by ACMA includes:
* Any online content that is classified RC or X 18+ by the Classification Board. This includes real depictions of actual Human sexual activity|sexual activity, child pornography, depictions of bestiality, material containing excessive violence or sexual violence, detailed instruction in crime, violence or drug use, and/or material that advocates the doing of a terrorist act.
* Content which is classified R 18+* and not subject to a restricted access system that prevents access by children. This includes depictions of simulated sexual activity, material containing strong, realistic violence and other material dealing with intense adult themes.<ref>Cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_90156 |title=ACMA - Content service provider responsibilities<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728030253/http://www.acma.gov.au/web/STANDARD//pc%3DPC_90156#prohib |archive-date=28 July 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all </ref>

In answer to a question in Parliament in October 2008, the government in January 2009 stated that of the 1,370 websites on the blacklisting|blacklist, 674 were related to child pornography, and the remainder would be classified as R18+ and X18+.<ref name=deafening_silence>cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/web/labor-stays-mum-on-censorship-trials/2009/01/30/1232818711139.html?page=fullpage |title=Labor Party's "deafening silence" as filter trial delayed |work=The Age |first=Asher |last=Moses |date=2009-01-30</ref>

Two websites are known to be on the ACMA blacklist after they were submitted to ACMA for review.  When ACMA responded with the advice that these sites had been placed upon its blacklist, ACMA's response was in turn posted back to the world Wide Web|web by the original submitters, with the purpose of demonstrating that political content would be censored by the mandatory filter. One was an Pro-life|anti-abortion website, with details posted to Whirlpool (website)|Whirlpool, and the other was a copy of Denmark's own Internet blacklist, with both the blacklist and ACMA's response posted on WikiLeaks. The web hosting company for Whirlpool, ''Bulletproof networks'', was threatened with $11,000 in fines per day if the link was not removed, so Whirlpool removed the link to the restricted site. Civil liberties campaigners regard the inclusion of these sites on the blacklist as a demonstration that it is not difficult to get a site placed on the blacklist, and that the blacklist includes sites which are themselves not illegal to view.<ref name=banned_links_11000/><ref>Cite web |url=http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,24897,25181408-15306,00.html |title=ACMA takes aim at Whirlpool, supplier (AustralianIT) |access-date=29 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914162425/http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,24897,25181408-15306,00.html |archive-date=14 September 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all </ref><ref>[https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Australia_secretly_censors_Wikileaks_press_release_and_Danish_Internet_censorship_list,_16_Mar_2009 Australia secretly censors Wikileaks press release and Danish Internet censorship list, 16 March 2009]</ref><ref name=already_chilling>[http://www.efa.org.au/2009/03/13/net-censorship-already-having-a-chilling-effect/ Net censorship already having a chilling effect (EFA)]</ref>

19 March 2009: Australian media sources report that the ACMA blacklist has been leaked to WikiLeaks <blockquote>"The seemingly innocuous websites were among a leaked list of 2300 websites the Australian Communications and Media Authority was planning to ban to protect children from graphic pornography and violence."<ref name="newscomau"/> </blockquote>
ACMA claimed that the list which appeared on the WikiLeaks website was not the ACMA 'blacklist', as it contained 2,300 URLs. ACMA claimed the ACMA list contained only 1,061 URLs in August 2008, and has at no stage contained 2,300.<ref name="ReferenceA">Cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_311669 |title=ACMA - ACMA media release 34/2009 – 19 March<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=19 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322070619/http://acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_311669 |archive-date=22 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all </ref>

The ACMA report on the issue noted the similarities between the two lists, yet addressed only the claim reported in the media that the list was the blacklist. The report only contains the following claims about the two lists:
* "The list provided to ACMA differs markedly in length and format to the ACMA blacklist."<ref name="ReferenceA" />
* "The ACMA blacklist has at no stage been 2,300 URLs in length and at August 2008 consisted of 1,061 URLs."<ref name="ReferenceA" />

20 March 2009: WikiLeaks published another list, this time closer to the length published by ACMA.

25 March 2009: Stephen Conroy has reportedly stated that this list closely resembles the ACMA list.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,28348,25240699-5014239,00.html Stephen Conroy says leaked list of banned websites 'seems like ACMA's blacklist' (news)]   webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327075340/http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0%2C28348%2C25240699-5014239%2C00.html |date=27 March 2009 </ref>

26 March 2009: The above report of 25 March 2009 was followed by the Minister's statement on the ABC's Q&A (Australian talk show)|''Q&A'' television program the following day<ref name="abc.net.au">[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2521164.htm Transcript and video of Senator Conroy on 'Q&A', 26 March 2009]</ref> that "the second list which has appeared appears to be closer [to the true black-list]. I don't actually know what's on the list but I'm told by [...] ACMA it appears to be closer to the actual, legitimate list."<br>
On the program Senator Conroy also explained that the seemingly inexplicable censoring of a dentist's website was due to subversion of the website by the Russian mafia, who had inserted RC material.

In the same discussion Bill Henson's website, despite the PG rating given to his photographs by the same body, appeared on the blacklist due to a technical error according to Stephen Conroy<ref name="abc.net.au"/><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/27/2527445.htm 'Technical error' behind Henson website black-listing - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The ACMA has since released a statement claiming the technical error was a "computer system caching error" and further stated "found that this is the only URL where a caching error resulting in the URL being incorrectly added to the list."<ref>cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/03/27/1237657133829.html |title='Caching error' caused Henson blacklisting |date=27 March 2009 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald</ref>

=Live filtering trials=
The government has committed to trials of the mandatory web filter before implementation.

On 28 July 2008, an Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA report entitled “Closed Environment Testing of ISP-Level Internet Content Filtering”<ref name="acma.gov.au"/> showed performance and accuracy problems with the six unnamed ISP-based filters trialled.<ref name="acma.gov.au">cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib310554/isp-level_internet_content_filtering_trial-report.pdf |title=Closed Environment Testing of ISP-Level Internet Content Filtering |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908162250/http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib310554/isp-level_internet_content_filtering_trial-report.pdf |archivedate=8 September 2008 |df=dmy-all</ref> Electronic Frontiers Australia|EFA analysis of the report showed that:<ref>[http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2008/minister_welcomes_advances_in_internet_filtering_technology Minister welcomes advances in internet filtering technology] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807042412/http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2008/minister_welcomes_advances_in_internet_filtering_technology |date=7 August 2008</ref><ref name=efa-says-failure>[http://www.efa.org.au/2008/07/31/efa-says-filtering-trial-a-failure/ EFA says Filtering Trial a Failure]</ref>
* One filter caused a 22% drop in speed even when it was ''not'' performing filtering;
* Only one of the six filters had an acceptable level of performance (a drop of 2% in a laboratory trial), the others causing drops in speed of between 21% and 86%;
* The most accurate filters were often the slowest;
* All filters tested had problems with under-censoring, allowing access to between 2% and 13% of material that they should have censored; and
* All filters tested had serious problems with over-censoring, wrongly censoring access to between 1.3% and 7.8% of the websites tested.<ref name=efa-says-failure/>
* The trial tested speed on a simple "black listed or not" basis for all simulated clients on all systems, yet the report outlines the ability of the filters to provide customised filtering to each client (as would be required by the two levels of filtering which ACMA is proposing) which would significantly impact test results.<ref name="acma.gov.au"/>

In November 2008, the Government hired Melbourne company ENEX TestLab, an RMIT University|RMIT spin-off, to design a live pilot test on a real network.<ref name=ENEX>[http://www.theage.com.au/national/opposition-rises-to-internet-filter-20081110-5lq5.html?page=-1 Opposition rises to internet filter]</ref>  In this trial, in which several ISPs have expressed an interest, 10,000 blacklisted "unwanted" websites would be censored in addition to 1,300 websites identified by ACMA.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24643380-952,00.html Internet Filter to block 10,000 "unwanted" websites (Courier-Mail)]</ref> As an incentive for participation, the department states that participating ISPs "will be recognised for their participation in the Pilot. This recognition will strengthen their brand image with the community".

These ISPs will also be allowed to keep any software and hardware purchased by the government for the trial. The trial may include some ability to censor or alert on the presence of proxies.  Both filtered and unfiltered users will be surveyed as part of the trial.<ref>[http://www.itwire.com/content/view/21628/53/1/0/ iTWire - Australian Government calls for live Internet filter trial]dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes</ref>

ISPs participating in the Live Trial will be required to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with ACMA.<ref>[http://www.dbcde.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/89159/request-for-expression-of-interest.pdf Internet Service Provider Filtering Pilot - Request for Expression of Interest<!-- Bot generated title -->] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514150729/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/89159/request-for-expression-of-interest.pdf |date=14 May 2009</ref>

Communications from Senator Conroy's office have indicated that the live trial will occur without the participation of any customers due to concerns about the impact on network performance of filtering 10,000 URLs. Telstra and Internode have stated that they will not take part in the trial. iiNet has stated that it will take part in the trial only to show that the filtering will not work. Optus has stated that it will only test a heavily cut-down filtering model containing only 1,300 URLs in a limited geographic area, and customers will be allowed to opt out.

At the end of 2008, Stephen Conroy anticipated that the live trial would test the filtering of BitTorrent traffic,<ref>[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/22/australia_bittorrent/ Oz net censorship apparatus to target BitTorrent] ''The Register'', 22 December 2008.</ref> but in March 2009 he stated that the proposed filters would not be effective on peer-to-peer traffic.<ref name=russian_mob>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/03/27/1237657120642.html Conroy admits blacklist error, blames 'Russian mob'] ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 27 March 009.</ref>

The trial was originally scheduled to be commenced in December 2008, but, after the existence of a report critical of the trial became known, the trial was pushed back.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24840506-2,00.html List of banned websites in Thailand and Denmark leaked online]</ref> On 11 February 2009 a new filtering trial was announced, initially with the ISPs iPrimus Telecommunications, Tech 2U, Webshield, OMNIconnect, Netforce and Highway 1. Testing with each ISP will take place for at least six weeks once filtering equipment has been obtained and installed, and iPrimus expects the trial to begin in late April or early May with five or ten thousand participants. The trial will be opt-in, with ISPs asking for volunteers, although all WebShield customers already receive a filtered service. None of the top three ISPs, Telstra, Optus and iiNet, have been included in the trial, although both iiNet and Optus did expect to be involved at a later time. iiNet withdrew itself from consideration for the trial in March 2009, with Michael Malone giving as reasons the media storm around the leaked blacklist, the changing nature of policy, and "confused" explanations of the trial's purpose.<ref>[http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2009/005 Pilot to assess technical feasibility of ISP filtering (DBCDE)] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213214256/http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2009/005 |date=13 February 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,25040817-2,00.html Optus and iiNet snubbed in web filter trials (news)]</ref><ref>[http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/communications/soa/iPrimus-to-start-filtering-in-April/0,130061791,339294918,00.htm iPrimus to start filtering in April (zdnet)]</ref><ref>[http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/communications/soa/iiNet-quits-Conroy-s-filter-trial/0,130061791,339295589,00.htm iiNet quits Conroy's filter trial (ZDNet)]</ref>

In July 2009, some results from the trials began to emerge. Five of the nine participating ISPs reported minimal speed or technical problems associated with the trials. Some ISPs reported that thousands of their members had voluntarily participated in the trials; others, that less than 1% had participated, and that this was not a representative sample. Some customers complained about over-blocking, and withdrew from the trial. One example was the censorship of the pornography website RedTube: ACMA refused to confirm or deny if the site was on the list, or if the site was legal.<ref>[http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/312354/isps_give_clean_feed_filter_technical_green-light ISPs give clean feed filter a technical green light (ARN)]</ref> Leading Australian statistic experts, however, have labelled the trials as unscientific, lacking in proper methodology, unrepresentative and "about the worst way you can do it".<ref>[http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/312845/statistics_experts_label_isp_filtering_trials_unscientific Statistics experts label ISP filtering trials unscientific]</ref>

In December 2009, the results of the filtering trial were released. Stephen Conroy stated, "The report into the pilot trial of ISP-level filtering demonstrates that censoring RC-rated material can be done with 100 percent accuracy and negligible impact on #Terminology|Internet speed".<ref name=PilotITNews>[http://www.itnews.com.au/News/162941,conroy-reveals-plans-to-censor-the-internet.aspx Conroy Reveals Plans to Censor the Internet]</ref> However, concerns have been raised about the report: only a small minority of ISP users participated; the trial did not test using any high-speed Internet connections similar to those available with the National Broadband Network; there is evidence that the filter was evaded; and with only 600 to 700 sites on the RC blacklists, the effect of the filter would be marginal at best.<ref>[http://newmatilda.com/2009/12/16/conroys-clean-feed-wont-block Conroy's clean feed won't block porn (New Matilda)]</ref>

=Opinion polling=
In February 2010, ABC's Hungry Beast program commissioned McNair Ingenuity Research to perform a telephone poll of 1,000 Australians.<ref>[http://hungrybeast.abc.net.au/sites/default/files/documents/Internet%20Regulation%20Survey%20-%20Report_FINAL.pdf Internet Regulation Survey] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308145456/http://hungrybeast.abc.net.au/sites/default/files/documents/Internet%20Regulation%20Survey%20-%20Report_FINAL.pdf |date=8 March 2011</ref> Key results were
* To the proposition "We need Government regulation of content on the Internet the same as we have Government regulation of content for other media" 62% agreed, 35% disagreed.
* "Having a mandatory Government Internet filter that would automatically censor all access in Australia, to overseas websites containing material that is Refused Classification?" Refused Classification was defined as "Images and information about one or more of the following: child sexual abuse, bestiality, sexual violence, gratuitous, exploitative or offensive sexual fetishes, detailed instructions on or promotion of crime, violence or use of illegal drugs". 80% were in favour, 19% against.
* "A Government appointed body determining whether a website is appropriate for you to visit?" 50% in favour, 46% against.
* "If a mandatory Internet Filter is established, are you in favour or not in favour of the community being advised which websites have been Refused Classification and the reason why they have been refused classification?" 91% in favour, 8% against.
* "Some opponents of the Government's mandatory Internet Filter are concerned that if it were put in place, future Governments could use Internet Filtering technology to restrict free speech or censor other forms of website content they don't approve of. Do you share this concern?" 70% concerned, 27% unconcerned.

The wide variation to answers to essentially the same question can be attributed to variations in the Opinion poll#Wording of questions|wording of the questions asked.Citation needed|date=February 2010 The results were initially reported as "80pc back web filter: poll" despite the fact that 46% were against "a government body determining whether a website is appropriate to visit".<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/02/10/2815232.htm 80pc back web filter: poll] ABC News, 10 February 2010.</ref>

In February 2009, a national telephone poll of 1,100 people was conducted by Galaxy and commissioned by GetUp!. It found that only 5 per cent of respondents want ISPs to be responsible for protecting children online, and only 4% want Government to have this responsibility.<ref name=deadend />

In March 2010, the results of the Whirlpool Australia broadband survey 2009 were published. This survey was of 21,755 experienced Internet users, and only 8% were in favour of the mandatory filter.<ref>[http://apcmag.com/92-of-whirlpool-users-against-filter.htm 92% of Whirlpool users against filter (APC magazine)]</ref>

In May 2010, the results of a study commissioned by the Safer Internet Group (consisting of Google, Internet Industry Association, iiNet, Australian Council of State School Organisations and the Australian Library and Information Association) were published. 39 people participated in four focus group interviews. The study consisted of four focus-group interviews of 39 participants and found that while people were aware of the pending legislation, they did not understand its details. When details of the government's proposal was explained, along with the possible alternatives, enthusiasm for the filter dropped.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/study-casts-doubt-over-net-filter-support-20100512-uvo0.html Study casts doubt over net filter support] ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 May 2010.</ref>

=Australian Law Reform Commission review=
In July 2010, Justice Minister Robert McClelland ordered the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) to review the criteria for the “refused classification” (RC) category, while also conducting public consultation and evaluating the practices and codes of companies in the sector.

The ALRC's report, released in February 2012, includes recommendations that:<ref>[http://www.alrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/publications/final_report_118_for_web.pdf ALRC Report 118: Classification—Content Regulation and Convergent Media], Australian Law Reform Commission, 29 February 2012</ref><ref name=RSF-Australia-2012>[http://en.rsf.org/australia-australia-12-03-2012,42080.html "Country Under Surveillance: Australia"], Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2012</ref>
* Type of content targeted by filtering rules should focus on adult content
* Content should be censored by ISPs only when it is defined as "prohibited"
* Government review prohibitions on "the depiction of sexual fetishes in films and detailed instruction in the use of proscribed drugs"
* Ban on content that "promotes, incites or instructs in matters of crime" be limited only to serious crime
* New media content classification act should be enacted to cover the classification of all media in Australia on any platform, and spell out how those responsible for content, including Internet service providers, should rank prohibited content
* Because of the large number of online media organisations, it would not be possible to classify everything and ISPs should "take reasonable steps" to identify prohibited content, including allowing users to report such content online

Voluntary filtering by ISPs
In June 2011, two Australian ISPs, Telstra and Optus, confirmed they would voluntarily block access to a list of child-abuse websites provided by the Australian Communications and Media Authority and more websites on a list compiled by unnamed international organisations from mid-year.<ref name="ISPFiltering-June2011" />

=Internet Industry Association filter code=
Internet Industry Association (IIA) had released a filter code on child abuse for the industry. IIA have stated that no new legislation amendments were required because ISPs were installing filters to censor access to facilitate carrying out legal requests under s313 of the Telecommunications Act.<ref>cite web |title=IIA details child abuse code of practice |author=Chloe Herrick |work=Computerworld |url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/391518/iia_details_child_abuse_code_practice/ |date=27 June 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2012</ref><ref>cite web |title=Internet industry moves on blocking child pornography |publisher=Internet Industry Association |url=http://iia.net.au/content/internet-industry-moves-blocking-child-pornography |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013200015/http://iia.net.au/content/internet-industry-moves-blocking-child-pornography |archivedate=13 October 2012 |df=dmy-all</ref> However no known code has been publicly released yet.

Internode (ISP)|Internode, TPG Telecom|TPG and Exetel have been against the scheme, unless the law compels them. iiNet is one notable exception in that they will work with the law, without a position on the scheme.

Proposal for an independent Media Council
In order to hold the press accountable to journalistic standards of accuracy, fairness, impartiality, integrity, and independence the 28 February 2012 "Report of the Independent Inquiry into Media and Media Regulation" proposes the creation of an independent News Media Council covering all platforms (print, online, radio and television) with the power to order changes to published content, publication of a right of reply by anyone or any organisation that makes a complaint, and the publication of an apology. Refusal to comply could result in the author, media organisation, or blogger being accused of contempt, a trial by a court, and the possibility of the fines and/or prison sentences associated with contempt of court findings.<ref>[http://www.dbcde.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/146994/Report-of-the-Independent-Inquiry-into-the-Media-and-Media-Regulation-web.pdf ''Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Media and Media Regulation''] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510044927/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/146994/Report-of-the-Independent-Inquiry-into-the-Media-and-Media-Regulation-web.pdf |date=10 May 2012, R. Finkelstein and M. Ricketson, Independent Media Inquiry Secretariat, Department for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, 28 February 2012</ref>

The proposal would have the effect of converting the code of ethics of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) into laws enforceable by the courts. There is a risk that small publishers and bloggers may feel coerced into publishing corrections or apologies when they lack the time, energy, or resources to defend themselves in court against a contempt charge.<ref name="RSF-Australia-2012" />

The campaign received widespread coverage in most major Australian newspapers and news websites. Censordyne become a topic of discussion on Nova 96.9 radio in Sydney and was featured on the Australian ABC television program ''Insiders (Australian TV program)|Insiders''.

GetUp! raised over $45,000 in donations from the general public during July 2009 to see the Censordyne commercial on TV and on Qantas flights during the month of August 2009, where all Australian politicians would be travelling to Canberra.

Dale Clapperton, then chairperson of EFA, argued that the Labor party cannot implement the clean feed proposal without either new legislation and the support of the Australian Senate, or the assistance of the Internet Industry Association. As the Liberals and Greens have both stated that they will not support legislation, it can only be implemented with the support of the IIA.<ref>[http://defendingscoundrels.com/2008/10/can-labor-implement-clean-feed.html Can Labor implement 'clean feed' without legislation?] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027100009/http://defendingscoundrels.com/2008/10/can-labor-implement-clean-feed.html |date=27 October 2008</ref>

NSW Young Labor has abandoned the www|web filtering plan, passing a motion rejecting Conroy's plans, and calling on him to adopt a voluntary, opt-in system.<ref name=cash_floods_in/>

Colin Jacobs, vice-chairman of Electronic Frontiers Australia, said that the pitfalls of mandatory ISP filtering were illustrated by the problems in the UK caused by the blocking of a single Wikipedia page. He also said of the IWF blacklist: <blockquote> "In Australia, not only would the Government have the ability to secretly add any site to our blacklist, but an unaccountable foreign-based organisation would as well".</blockquote>

Conservative South Australian Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi does not support the mandatory www|web filter. He considers Stephen Conroy's plan to be "so devoid of detail" that it is impossible to form an opinion on it, and says <blockquote>"Parental responsibility cannot and should not be abrogated to government—if it is, our society will only become weaker ... Yes, illegal content should be banned from the web ... but it is wrong to give the government a blank cheque to determine what is appropriate for us to view on the Internet."<ref name=hurdle>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/new-hurdle-for-net-censorship/2008/12/12/1228585100603.html?page=fullpage New hurdle for net censorship (SMH)]</ref> </blockquote>

Clive Hamilton, a senior ethics professor at the Australian National University whose think tank The Australia Institute was responsible for the initial media attention for a mandatory Internet filter in 2003, argues <blockquote> "The laws that mandate upper speed limits do not stop people from speeding, does that mean that we should not have those laws? ...

In an open letter to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Reporters Without Borders states that the www|web filter is not the solution to combating child sex abuse, and the plan entails risks to freedom of expression. The censorship of websites by Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA, rather than a Judge, is in contravention of laws. The criteria for censoring "inappropriate" websites is too vague, and it would be a dangerous censorship option to target "Refused classification" sites, many of which are unrelated to sexual abuse. Subjects such as abortion, anorexia, aborigines and legislation on the sale of marijuana would all risk being filtered, as would media reports on these subjects.<ref>[http://www.rsf.org/spip.php?page=article&id_article=35379 Open letter to Australia's Prime Minister (Reporters without Borders)] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111050846/http://www.rsf.org/spip.php?page=article&id_article=35379 |date=11 January 2010</ref>

The Howard Government commissioned a number of independent technical experts to examine Internet filtering. The resulting report was delivered to the Australian Government in February 2008, and released publicly in December 2008. Professor Bjorn Landfeldt, one of the report's authors, stated that filtering technology simply does not work, as it can easily be bypassed and #Terminology|slows access to the Internet by up to 87%. In response, Stephen Conroy has stated that the report involved no empirical testing, and was simply a literature review of material available from other sources; any problems raised by the report would be tested during the filter trials scheduled for mid-January 2009.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/web/fatal-flaws-in-website-censorship-plan-says-report/2008/12/22/1229794328860.html?page=fullpage Fatal Flaws in Web Censorship Plan, says report]</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24839172-953,00.html Government rejects negative internet filter report]</ref>

A report by Tim Stevens and Peter Neumann for the London-based The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence|International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR) analyses each of the available ISP-based filtering solutions and concludes that they are ineffective in the fight against terror. A hybrid filtering scheme was rated the best, but it is ineffective against dynamic content such as chat pages and instant messaging, and had political implications because it required the existence of a blacklist of censored pages. The report instead advocates the use of takedown notices for extremist content, and prosecutions to "signal that individuals engaged in online extremism are not beyond the law".<ref>[http://www.itnews.com.au/News/98522,internet-filtering-ineffective-in-fight-against-terror.aspx Internet filtering ineffective in the fight against terror (itNews Australia)]</ref>

The Metaverse Journal suggests that because www|web filtering logs every site visit, and some information about who is visiting the site, then it is ripe for abuse by whoever runs the filters. It potentially allows surveillance of any user of the Internet, such as journalists, political opponents, or even the family members of politicians.<ref>[http://www.metaversejournal.com/2009/06/29/proposed-isp-filtering-allows-surveillance-of-journalists-citizens-politicians/ Proposed ISP filtering allows surveillance of journalists, citizens, politicians (Metaverse journal)] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702060859/http://www.metaversejournal.com/2009/06/29/proposed-isp-filtering-allows-surveillance-of-journalists-citizens-politicians/ |date=2 July 2009</ref>

Ross Fitzgerald of ''The Australian'' believes that the filter was not introduced in 2010 to defuse it as an election issue, and that if it is re-introduced into the next parliament it could be even more censorious than the current proposal.<ref name=conroys_agenda />

Australian radio presenter and writer Helen Razer dislikes the filter because she enjoys pornography, does not believe it causes harm to adults, and doesn't think that children are at much risk:<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/hey-senator--leave-us-porn-viewers-alone/2009/01/23/1232471591602.html?page=fullpage Hey, Senator - leave us discerning viewers of pornography alone (SMH)]</ref>

<blockquote>"I enjoy pornography. Perhaps not quite so much as I enjoy living among citizens who take an entitlement to free speech for granted. But I do like it quite a lot. And it seems that my porn is endangered. If Conroy's clean feed works, which some tech sceptics argue that it cannot, it will prevent access to all pornography ... I can report that one doesn't simply amble into X-rated or even R18+ material ... I have become adept at this; children, presumably, have not. And if they have, clearly they are the issue of the world's most reprehensible parents and should be sent to live with Hetty Johnston forthwith ... Despite the best efforts of some, there is no evidence that pornography will negatively affect me or other consenting adults ... The only lasting effect of my access to porn is a reflex giggle when the pizza delivery man knocks on my door."</blockquote>

In September 2009, the group Anonymous reawakened, in ''Operation Didgeridie'', in order to protest the policy of Internet censorship, and on 9 September initiated a Distributed Denial-of-service attack against the prime minister's website. As a result of this attack, the site was taken offline for approximately one hour.<ref>cite news |title=Rudd website attacked in filter protest |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/10/2681642.htm |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2010</ref>

On 10 February 2010, the Parliament of Australia's website, www.aph.gov.au, was attacked by Anonymous once again.
