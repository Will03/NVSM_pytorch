ARIA Awards

The ARIA No.&nbsp;1 Chart Awards were established in 2002 to recognise Australian recording artists, who reached number one on the ARIA albums, singles and music DVDs charts.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIANo.1ChartAwards1July2005.htm |title=ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards (1 July 2005) |publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association |accessdate=30 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215043454/http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIANo.1ChartAwards1July2005.htm |archivedate=15 February 2014 |df=dmy </ref>

=ARIA Music Awards=
main|ARIA Music Awards
The ARIA Music Awards is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the Music of Australia|Australian music industry. The event has been held annually since 1987; it encompasses the general genre-specific and popular awards known as the ARIA Awards, as well as the Fine Arts Awards and Artisan Awards (held separately from 2004), Lifetime Achievement Awards and the ARIA Hall of Fame (held separately from 2005 to 2010 but returned to the general ceremony in 2011).

Criticisms
Like most recording industry associations, ARIA has been criticised for fighting copyright infringement matters aggressively, although in Australia this has largely taken the form of aggressive advertising campaigns particularly in cinemas directly preceding movies. This criticism is stauncher in Australia due to the absence of an equivalent Digital Millennium Copyright Act or state crimes acts which clearly establish copyright infringement as a crime.citation needed|date=October 2016
<!-- This is not entirely correct, as Australia does have an amendment act to the copyright act which covers digital intellectual property, someone with exact knowledge of this should add information regarding it -->

In February 2004, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) took legal action against Kazaa, alleging massive copyright breaches. The trial began on 29 November 2004. On 6 February 2005, the homes of two Sharman Networks executives and the offices of Sharman Networks in Australia were raided under a court order by ARIA to gather evidence for the trial.citation needed|date=October 2016

The ARIA charts have also been criticised as an easily manipulated market tool abused by aggressively marketed pop acts. "Gold" and "Platinum" ARIA awards are based on units shipped to retail outlets, not on how many of those units are sold to customers. A lukewarm album or single release can achieve Gold or Platinum status by flooding the market with copies, and if 99% are returned to the manufacturer that in no way affects the status of the award.citation needed|date=October 2016

ARIA has been criticised by former ''Australian Idol'' judge and record producer Ian Dickson (music mogul)|Ian Dickson for a perceived intolerance of ''Australian Idol'' contestants, and a lack of nomination in the ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Awards.<ref>cite web | first=Bernard | last=Zuel | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/will-idol-graduates-ever-get-any-respect/2007/09/05/1188783289280.html?page=fullpage | title=Scarlet letters | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=2007-09-06 </ref>
