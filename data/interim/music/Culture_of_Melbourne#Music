Literature

Melbourne's literary history is  rich and diverse. The State Library of Victoria was the first major cultural institution to be established in Melbourne since its founding in 1854, and is one of Australia's oldest cultural institutions. The library holds more than two million books and 16,000 serials, and is a part of an extensive network of public and university libraries across the city. A wide range of independent bookstores also exist in the city, as well as a variety of larger bookstore chains, and in 1960, the first children’s bookstore in Australia, The Little Bookroom, was opened.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.killyourdarlingsjournal.com/2013/12/all-grown-up-a-brief-history-of-the-little-bookroom/|title=All grown up: a brief history of The Little Bookroom — Kill Your Darlings|website=www.killyourdarlingsjournal.com</ref>  The Foreign Language Bookshop is the oldest and largest language bookshop in Australasia, established in 1938 in Bourke Street as a free lending library.<ref>Miceli, Jacob (February 2008), "A Language of Love", Bookseller and Publisher Magazine, 28, ISSN 0004-8763</ref>  The primary aim of the business was to reduce migrant isolation, particularly for European migrants disembarking from ships into Australia.

Melbourne's literary publishing sector is the largest in Australia, including the largest number of independent publishers, and presents two of Australia’s most significant literary awards: the Victorian Premier's Literary Awards and the Melbourne Prize for Literature. Melbourne is the setting of many significant novels including Helen Garner’s ''Monkey Grip (novel)|Monkey Grip'', George Johnston (novelist)|George Johnston's ''My Brother Jack'', Christos Tsiolkas’ ''The Slap (novel)|The Slap'' and Fergus Hume's ''The Mystery of a Hansom Cab'', which was the best-selling detective novel of the 19th century.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-review-the-1886-mystery-of-a-hansom-cab-has-murder-and-a-kitschy-charm/2014/03/26/7ea75cfe-b42b-11e3-b899-20667de76985_story.html|title=Book review: The 1886 ‘Mystery of a Hansom Cab’ has murder and a kitschy charm|first=Michael|last=Dirda|date=26 March 2014|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com</ref> Garner's seminal 1977 novel ''Monkey Grip'' achieved notability for capturing Melbourne's burgeoning counter-culture scene, as well as the lives of communal junkies living in sharehouses in the inner city.

The Melbourne Writers Festival was founded in 1986 and is an annual, two-week literary festival that hosts keynotes, panels and workshops by a wide range of local and international guests. Since beginning as a one-day zine fair in 2004, the Emerging Writers' Festival has expanded to ten days of events, workshops, and panel discussions that are focused on the development of writers. Annually across Melbourne there are many local writers’ festivals including the Bayside Literary Festival, Williamstown Literary Festival and Glen Eira Storytelling Festival. In addition to book readings by local authors, many of these events provide opportunities for local writers to develop their skills via workshops and short-story competitions.

In August 2008, Melbourne was the second city in the world to be recognised as a City of Literature by UNESCO—the Wheeler Centre for Books, Writing and Ideas is a literary and publishing centre founded as part of Melbourne's successful bid. As well as programming literary events, debates and awards, the Wheeler Centre hosts literary organisations such as the Melbourne Writers’ Festival, Emerging Writers’ Festival, SPUNC, Australian Poetry, Express Media, Writers Victoria and the Melbourne City of Literature Office.
