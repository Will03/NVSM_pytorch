This is a list of nickname-related list articles on Wikipedia. A nickname is "a familiar or humorous name given to a person or thing instead of or as well as the real name."<ref>Citation | contribution = nickname |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/nickname | title = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = online | accessdate = September 26, 2011</ref> A nickname is often considered desirable, symbolising a form of acceptance, but can sometimes be a form of ridicule. A moniker also means a nickname or personal name. The word often distinguishes personal names from nicknames that became proper names out of former nicknames. English examples are Bob and Rob, nickname variants for Robert.
