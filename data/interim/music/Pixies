The Pixies are an American alternative rock band formed in 1986 in Boston, Massachusetts. The original line-up was composed of Black Francis (vocals, rhythm guitar), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), Kim Deal (bass, backing vocals) and David Lovering (drums). The band disbanded acrimoniously in 1993, but reunited in 2004. After Deal left in 2013, the Pixies hired Kim Shattuck as a touring bassist; she was replaced the same year by Paz Lenchantin, who became a permanent member in 2016.

The Pixies were associated with the 1990s alternative rock boom, and draw on elements including punk rock and surf music|surf rock. Their music is known for its dynamic "loud-quiet" shifts and song structures. Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter; his often surreal lyrics cover offbeat subjects such as extraterrestrials, incest, and biblical violence. They achieved modest popularity in their home country, but were more successful in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe. Their jarring pop sound influenced bands such as Nirvana (band)|Nirvana, Radiohead, Bush (British band)|Bush, Blur (band)|Blur and Weezer. Their popularity grew in the years following their break-up, leading to sold-out world tours following their reunion in 2004.

 History 

= Formation (1986) =
File:BlackFrancisTroxy.jpg|thumb|Founding member and principal songwriter Black FrancisGuitarist Joey Santiago and songwriter Black Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) met when they lived next to each other in a suite while attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies"/> Although Santiago was worried about distractions, he noticed Francis played music and the pair began to jam together.<ref name=ganz/> Francis embarked on a student exchange trip to Puerto Rico to study Spanish.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> After six months, he returned to Amherst and dropped out of the university.<ref name=sisario/> Francis and Santiago spent 1984 working in a warehouse, with Francis composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics on the subway train.<ref name=ganz2/>

The pair formed a band in January 1986.<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> Two weeks later, Francis placed an advertisement seeking a female bass player who liked both the folk music act Peter, Paul and Mary and the alternative rock band Hüsker Dü.<ref name="ganz3" /> Kim Deal was the only respondent, and arrived at the audition without a bass, as she had never played one before.<ref name="ganz4" /><ref name="sisario2" /> She was invited to join the band as she liked the songs Francis showed her. She obtained a bass, and the trio started rehearsing in Deal's apartment.<ref name="Frank|Ganz|2005|p=20" />

After recruiting Deal, Kim paid for her sister, Kelley Deal, to fly to Boston and audition as drummer. Though Francis approved, Kelley was not confident in her drumming, and was more interested in playing songs written by Kim; she later joined Kim's other band, the The Breeders|Breeders.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/14/popandrock.breeders|title=Kim and Kelley Deal on becoming the platinum-selling Breeders|last=Chick|first=Stevie|date=2008-03-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15</ref> Kim's husband suggested they hire David Lovering, whom Kim had met at her wedding reception.<ref name="ganz6" /><ref name="sisario3" /> The group arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word "pixies" randomly from a dictionary, liking how it looked and its definition as "mischievous little elves".<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> The Pixies moved rehearsals to Lovering's parents' garage in mid-1986<ref name="Frank|Ganz|2005|p=20" /><ref name="sisario4" /> and began to play shows at bars in the Boston area.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" />

=''Come on Pilgrim'' (1987) =
While the Pixies were playing a concert with Throwing Muses, they were noticed by producer Gary Smith (record producer)|Gary Smith, manager of Fort Apache Studios.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> He told the band he "could not sleep until you guys are world famous".<ref name="officialprofile"/> The band produced a 17-track demo at Fort Apache soon afterwards, known to fans as the Pixies (EP)|''Purple Tape'' because of the tape cover's purple background. Funded by Francis' father at the cost of $1000, the recording session was completed in three days.<ref name="Sisario, 2006. p. 16"/> Local promoter Ken Goes became the band's manager, and he passed the demo to Ivo Watts-Russell of the independent record label 4AD.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> Watts-Russell nearly passed on the band, finding them too normal, "too rock 'n' roll", but signed them at the persuasion of his girlfriend.<ref name=sisario5/>

Upon signing with 4AD, eight tracks from the Purple Tape were selected for the ''Come on Pilgrim'' mini-LP, the Pixies' first release.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> Francis drew upon his experiences in Puerto Rico, mostly in the songs "Vamos" and "Isla de Encanta", describing the poverty in Puerto Rico.<ref name="officialprofile"/> The religious lyrics in ''Come on Pilgrim'' and later albums came from his parents' born-again Christian days in the Pentecostal Church.<ref name="officialprofile"/> Critic Heather Phares sees themes such as sexual frustration ("I've Been Tired") and incest ("Nimrod's Son" and "The Holiday Song") on the record.<ref name=allmu/>

= ''Surfer Rosa'' and ''Doolittle'' (1988–89) =

''Come on Pilgrim'' was followed by the Pixies' first full-length album, ''Surfer Rosa''. The album was recorded by Steve Albini (who was hired by Watts-Russell on the advice of a 4AD colleague),<ref name=ganz7/> completed in two weeks, and released in early 1988.<ref name="officialprofile"/> ''Surfer Rosa'' gained the Pixies acclaim in Europe; both ''Melody Maker'' and ''Sounds (magazine)|Sounds'' gave ''Surfer Rosa'' their "Album of the Year" award. American critical response was also positive yet more muted, a reaction that persisted for much of the band's career.<ref name=sisario6/> The album was eventually certified Gold in the U.S. in 2005.<ref name=riaa/> After the album was released, the band arrived in England to support Throwing Muses on the European "Sex and Death" tour—beginning at the Mean Fiddler in London.<ref name=ganz8/> The tour also took them to the Netherlands, where the Pixies had already received enough media attention to be headlining the tour. Francis later recalled: "The first place I made it with the Pixies was in Holland."<ref name=cosyns/> The tour became notable for the band's in-jokes, such as playing their entire set list in alphabetical order.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

Meanwhile, the Pixies signed an American distribution deal with major record label Elektra Records|Elektra.<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> Around this time, the Pixies struck up a relationship with the British producer Gil Norton. Norton produced their second full album, ''Doolittle (album)|Doolittle'',<ref name="carew" /> which was recorded in the last six weeks of 1988 and seen as a departure from the raw sound of ''Come on Pilgrim'' and ''Surfer Rosa''. ''Doolittle'' had a much cleaner sound, largely due to Norton and the production budget of United States dollar|US$40,000, which was quadruple that of ''Surfer Rosa''.<ref name="sisario7" /> ''Doolittle'' featured the single "Here Comes Your Man", which biographers Josh Frank and Caryn Ganz describe as an unusually jaunty and pop-like song for the band.<ref name="ganz9" /> "Monkey Gone to Heaven" was a Top 10 modern rock radio hit in the U.S.,<ref name="billboard albums" /> and reached the Top 100 in the U.K.<ref name="uk singles" /> Like ''Surfer Rosa'', ''Doolittle'' was acclaimed by fans and music critics alike.<ref name="carew" />

= Hiatus (1989–90) =
After ''Doolittle'', tensions between Deal and Francis came to a head (for example, Francis threw a guitar at Deal during a concert in Stuttgart),<ref name=ganz10/> and Deal was almost fired from the band when she refused to play at a concert in Frankfurt.<ref name=aston/> Santiago, in an interview with ''Mojo (magazine)|Mojo'', described Deal as being "headstrong and want[ing] to include her own songs, to explore her own world" on the band's albums; eventually she accepted that Francis was the singer and had musical control of the band, but after the Frankfurt incident, "they kinda stopped talking".<ref name=aston/> The band became increasingly tired during the post-''Doolittle'' "Fuck or Fight" tour of the United States and fighting among members continued.<ref name=carew/> After the tour's final date in New York City, the band was too exhausted to attend the end-of-tour party the following night and soon announced a hiatus.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

During this time, Santiago and Lovering went on vacation<ref name=carew/> while Francis performed a short solo tour,<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> made up of a number of concerts to generate gas money as he traveled across the country.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> Deal formed a new band, the The Breeders|Breeders, with Tanya Donelly of Throwing Muses and bass player Josephine Wiggs of Perfect Disaster.<ref name=breedersbiography/> Their debut album, ''Pod (The Breeders album)|Pod'', was released in 1990.<ref name=breedersbiography/><ref name=allmu2/>

= ''Bossanova'' and ''Trompe le Monde'' (1990–1993) =
File:PixiesTicket1990.jpg|thumb|Pixies ticket from 1st October, 1990In 1990, all members of the group except for Deal moved to Los Angeles.<ref name=ganz12/> Lovering stated that he, Santiago, and Francis moved there "because the recording studio was there".<ref name=ganz13/> Unlike previous recordings, the band had little time to practice beforehand, and Black Francis wrote much of the album in the studio.<ref name=ganz14/> Featuring the singles "Velouria" and "Dig for Fire", ''Bossanova (Pixies album)|Bossanova'' reached number 70 in the United States.<ref name="billboard albums"/> In contrast, the album peaked at number three in the United Kingdom.<ref name="uk albums"/> Also in 1990, the Pixies released a cover of the Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band's "Born in Chicago" on the compilation album ''Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary''.<ref name=allmu3/>

The band continued to tour and released ''Trompe le Monde'' in 1991, their final album before their break-up. The album included "U-Mass", which has been described as being about college apathy,<ref name=magnet/> and whose guitar riff was written years before at the University of Massachusetts before Francis and Santiago dropped out.<ref name=magnet/> The album also featured a cover of "Head On" by The Jesus and Mary Chain.<ref name=allmu4/> Also that year, the band contributed a cover of "I Can't Forget" to the Leonard Cohen tribute album ''I'm Your Fan'',<ref name=allmu5/> and began an international tour on which they played stadiums in Europe and smaller venues in the United States.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> They then embarked on an uncomfortable tour supporting U2 on their Zoo TV Tour in 1992.<ref name=barton/> Tensions rose among band members, and at the end of the year, the Pixies went on sabbatical and focused on separate projects.<ref name=barton/>

= Breakup and solo projects (1993–2003) =
In early 1993, Francis announced in an interview to BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5 that the Pixies were finished. He offered no explanation at the time, unbeknownst to the other members of the band.<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> He later called Santiago and notified Deal and Lovering via fax, in January 1993.<ref name="sisario8" /> 

After the breakup, the members embarked on separate projects. Black Francis renamed himself Frank Black,<ref name="allmu6" /> and released several solo albums, including a string of releases with Frank Black and the Catholics.<ref name="fbatcr" /> Deal returned to the Breeders, who scored a hit with "Cannonball (Breeders song)|Cannonball" from their platinum-selling ''Last Splash'' in 1993, and released two more albums several years later.<ref name="breedersbiography" /> She also formed the Amps, who released one album.<ref name="nudea" /><ref name="village" /> 

Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black albums,<ref name="allmu7" /><ref name="allmu8" /><ref name="allmu9" /> as well as on other artists' albums.<ref name="allmu10" /><ref name="allmu11" /> He wrote theme music for the show ''Undeclared'' on Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox television and film ''Crime and Punishment in Suburbia''.<ref name="pharesmartinis" /> He formed the Martinis with his wife Linda Mallari, who released an album in 2004.<ref name="martinis" /> In 2004, he also played lead guitar on the album "Statecraft" by the novelist and musician Charles Douglas (musician)|Charles Douglas.<ref name="ewrev" /> Lovering went on to become a magician and made occasional appearances as "The Scientific Phenomenalist", performing experiments on stage and occasionally opening for Frank Black and the Breeders.<ref name="nipp" /> Lovering drummed with the band Cracker (band)|Cracker,<ref name="pharesmartinis" /> as well as on one of Tanya Donelly's solo albums,<ref name="allmu12" /> and on the Martinis' song "Free", which appeared on the ''Empire Records'' soundtrack.<ref name="pharesmartinis" />

4AD and Elektra Records continued to release Pixies material: the best-of album ''Death to the Pixies'' (1997),<ref name="allmu13" /> the Peel-session compilation ''Pixies at the BBC'' (1998),<ref name="4ad" /> and the ''Complete 'B' Sides'' compilation (2001).<ref name="b-sides" /> In 2002, material from the Pixies' original 17-track demo tape was released as an EP, ''Pixies (EP)|Pixies'', on Cooking Vinyl in the U.K.<ref name="cookin" /> and SpinArt Records in the U.S.;<ref name="spina" /> Frank Black has also used these labels to release solo work<ref name="cookin2" /><ref name="cookin3" /> and albums with the Catholics.<ref name="fbatcr" /><ref name="spina2" />

= Reunion (2003–12) =
In the years following the breakup, rumors circulated of a reunion. Though Frank Black dismissed them,<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /><ref name=magnet/><ref name=nme/> he incorporated an increasing number of Pixies songs in his sets with the Catholics,<ref name=mendel/> and occasionally included Santiago in his solo work and Lovering's magic show as an opening act to concerts.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" />

In 2003, a series of phone calls among band members resulted in some low-key rehearsals, and soon the decision to reunite.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> By February 2004, a full tour was announced,<ref name=nme2/> and tickets for nearly all the initial tour dates sold out within minutes.<ref name=nme3/> The band's four-night run at London's Brixton Academy was the fastest selling in the venue's twenty-year history.<ref name=pennyb/>

The Pixies played their first reunion concert on April 13, 2004, at The Fine Line Music Cafe in Minneapolis, Minnesota,<ref name=nme4/> and a warm-up tour through the U.S. and Canada was followed by an appearance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.<ref name=allbusiness/><ref name=mtv/> The band then spent much of 2004 touring throughout Brazil, Europe, Japan, and the U.S.<ref name=allbusiness/> The group won the Act-of-the-Year award in the 2004 ''Boston Music Awards''.<ref name=boston/> The 2004 reunion tour reportedly grossed over $14 million in ticket sales.<ref name=chict/>

In 2005, the band made appearances at festivals including Lollapalooza,<ref name=rolling/> "T on the Fringe",<ref name=gigw/> and the Newport Folk Festival.<ref name=billb/> They continued to make appearances through 2006 and 2007,<ref name=nme5/><ref name=nme6/> culminating in their first-ever appearances in Australia.<ref name=citys/> Since 2005, Francis has at various times stated that the Pixies recording a new studio album was either a possibility,<ref name=nme7/><ref name=nme8/><ref name=nme9/> or an unlikelihood,<ref name=nme10/><ref name=abc/> the main obstacle being Deal's reluctance to do so.<ref name=nme11/><ref name=nme12/>

To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of ''Doolittle'', the Pixies launched a tour in October 2009 where they performed the album track-for-track, including the associated B-sides.<ref name=nmejune29/> The tour began in Europe,<ref name=nmejune29/> continued in the United States in November,<ref name=nme13/> with the South American and Australian tour following in March 2010, then New Zealand, and more European dates in spring 2010,<ref name=eyeb/><ref name=nme14/> and back to North America in fall 2010 and into spring 2011.<ref name=nme15/><ref name=eyeb2/>

On June 14, 2013, the Pixies announced that Deal had left the band. Deal has since released new solo music and the remaining Pixies have welcomed her to come back as her schedule with Breeders allows.<ref name="kdback"/> Two weeks later, the band released a new song, "Bagboy", as a free download via the Pixies website.

 Style 
''Spin (magazine)|Spin'' magazine described the Pixies' musical style as "Surf music-meets-The Stooges|Stooges spikiness and oft-imitated stop/start and quiet/loud dynamics".<ref>citation |last=Jason |first=Cohen |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6Vy26TGdauEC&pg=PA36&dq=pixies+black+francis+stooges#v=onepage&q=pixies%20black%20francis%20stooges&f=false |title=Life to the Pixies |work=Spin (magazine)|Spin |date=August 2002 |page=36</ref> Their music has also been pictured as "an unorthodox marriage of surf music and punk rock, ... characterized by Black's bristling lyrics and hackle-raising caterwaul, Kim Deal's whispered harmonies and waspy basslines, Joey Santiago's fragile guitar, and the persistent flush of David Lovering's drums."<ref name=barton /> The band's music incorporates extreme dynamic shifts; Francis explained in 1991, "Those are the two basic components of rock music&nbsp;... the dreamy side and the rockin' side. It's always been either sweaty or laid back and cool. We do try to be dynamic, but it's dumbo dynamics, because we don't know how to do anything else. We can play loud or quiet—that's it".<ref name="Guitar Player" />

= Influences =
The Pixies are influenced by a range of artists and genres; each member came from a different musical background. When he first started writing songs for the Pixies, Francis says he was listening to nothing but Hüsker Dü, Captain Beefheart, and Iggy Pop;<ref name=sisario9 /> During the making of ''Doolittle'' he listened heavily to the The Beatles|Beatles' ''The Beatles (album)|White Album''.<ref name=sisario10 /> He has cited Buddy Holly as a model for his compressed songwriting.<ref name=sisario11 /> Francis did not discover punk rock until he was 16, saying "it was good I didn't listen to these hip records". As a child, he listened mainly to 1960s songs, religious music and Emerson, Lake & Palmer|Emerson Lake and Palmer, then Iggy Pop, Hüsker Dü|Husker Du, Captain Beefheart and Talking Heads, who he says "weren't punk either".<ref>[http://www.nme.com/photos/29-geeky-facts-you-might-not-know-about-pixies/375136#/photo/1 29 Geeky Facts You Might Not Know About Pixies], NME</ref>

Other media such as film has influenced the Pixies; Francis cites surrealist films ''Eraserhead'' and ''Un chien andalou'' (as mentioned in "Debaser") as influences.<ref name="officialprofile" /> He has commented on these influences, saying he "didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels", but found it easier to watch twenty-minute films.<ref name=sisario13 />

= Songwriting and vocals =
Most of the Pixies' songs were composed and sung by Francis. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine has described Francis's writing as containing "bizarre, fragmented lyrics about space, religion, sex, mutilation, and pop culture".<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> Biblical violence is a theme of ''Doolittle'''s "Dead" and "Gouge Away";<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /><ref name=sisario14 /> Francis told a ''Melody Maker'' interviewer, "It's all those characters in the Old Testament. I'm obsessed with them. Why it comes out so much I don't know."<ref name="sisario16"/> He has described ''Come on Pilgrim's'' "Caribou" as being about reincarnation,<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> and extraterrestrial themes appear in a number of songs on ''Bossanova''.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" />

Deal co-wrote ''Doolittle'''s "Silver" with Francis,<ref name=doolittle /> and they share lead harmony vocals on the track.<ref name="Sisario, 2006. p. 16" /> She also co-wrote and sang lead vocals on ''Surfer Rosa'''s "Gigantic",<ref name=surferrosa /><ref name=guard3 /> and is the sole songwriter of the 2004 digital single "Bam Thwok".<ref name=rogers /><ref name=billb2 /> She was credited as Mrs. John Murphy on the former composition<ref name=surferrosa />—at the time she was married and she used this name as an ironic Feminism|feminist joke.<ref name=sisario16 /> She also sang lead vocals on the song "Into the White" and the Neil Young cover "Winterlong", both B-sides.<ref name=b-sides /> Lovering sang lead vocals on ''Doolittle'''s "La La Love You"<ref name=doolittle /> and the B-side "Make Believe".<ref name=b-sides />

 Legacy 
Although the Pixies produced relatively few albums, whose sales were modest, they influenced a number of bands associated with the alternative rock boom of the 1990s.<ref name=rollingstone/><ref name=egan/> Gary Smith, who produced their ''Come on Pilgrim'', commented on the band's influence on alternative rock and their legacy in 1997:<ref name=egan/>

<blockquote>I've heard it said about The Velvet Underground that while not a lot of people bought their albums, everyone who did started a band. I think this is largely true about the Pixies as well. Charles' secret weapon turned out to be not so secret and, sooner or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all the world like a Pixies song.</blockquote>

Sonically, the Pixies are credited with popularizing the extreme dynamics and stop-start timing that would become widespread in alternative rock; Pixies songs typically feature hushed, restrained verses, and explosive, wailing choruses.<ref name=magnet/> Artists including David Bowie, Matt Noveskey, Radiohead, PJ Harvey, U2, Nirvana (band)|Nirvana, The Strokes, Alice in Chains, Weezer, Bush (band)|Bush, Arcade Fire, Pavement (band)|Pavement, Everclear (band)|Everclear, Kings of Leon and Matthew Good have cited admiration of or influence by the Pixies.<ref name=carew/><ref name=rhino/><ref name=allmusic/><ref name=Alexakis/> Bono of U2 has called the Pixies "one of America's greatest bands ever",<ref name=rhino/><ref name=eww/> and Radiohead's Thom Yorke said that the Pixies "changed my life".<ref name=egan/> Bowie, whose own music had inspired Francis and Santiago while they were at university, has said that the Pixies made "just about the most compelling music of the entire 80s."<ref name=rhino/>

One notable citation as an influence was by Kurt Cobain, on influencing Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which he admitted was a conscious attempt to co-opt the Pixies' style. In a January 1994 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', he said, "I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it [smiles]. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band—or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard."<ref name=egan/><ref name=bbc/> Cobain cited ''Surfer Rosa'' as one of his main musical influences, and particularly admired the album's natural and powerful drum sounds—a result of Steve Albini's influence on the record. Albini later produced Nirvana's 1993 ''In Utero (album)|In Utero'' at the request of Cobain.<ref name=azzerad/>

 In the media 
No music videos were released from ''Come on Pilgrim'' or ''Surfer Rosa'', but from ''Doolittle'' onwards, the following videos were made: "Monkey Gone To Heaven", "Here Comes Your Man", "Velouria", "Dig For Fire", "Allison", "Alec Eiffel", "Head On", and "Debaser";<ref name=jawetz/> these were later released on the 2004 DVD ''Pixies''.<ref name=jawetz/> Furthermore, a music video accompanied the release of their 2013 song, "Bagboy", as well an alternate video released on a later date. Videos have been made for all the songs in EP1. The videos for "Here Comes Your Man" and "Allison" were also released on ''The Complete 'B' Sides''.<ref name=b-sides/>

By ''Bossanova'', the band had developed a severe aversion to recording music videos, and Francis refused to lip-sync to them.<ref name="pg140"/> For example, in the "Here Comes Your Man" video, both Black and Deal open their mouths wide instead of mouthing their lyrics.<ref name=popbu/> According to the record label this became one of the reasons that the Pixies never achieved major coverage on MTV.<ref name="pg140" />

With ''Bossanova'''s release, 4AD hoped to get the Pixies chosen to perform their single "Velouria" on the BBC music programme ''Top of the Pops''.<ref name=mendel2/> To this end, the band was pressured into producing a video for the song, and they made one cheaply with the band members filmed running down a quarry, shown in slow motion.<ref name="pg140" /><ref name=barding/> The group was ultimately not given a spot on the show.<ref name=barding/><ref name=mendel3/>

A 90-minute documentary called ''loudQUIETloud: a film about the Pixies'' directed by Steven Cantor and Matthew Galkin was released in 2006. The film documents their 2004 reunion and tour, and covers the years after the break-up.<ref name=loudq/> In addition to ''Pixies'' and ''LoudQUIETloud'', four other Pixies' DVDs were released between 2004 and 2006, all featuring concert performances: ''Live at the Town and Country Club 1988'',<ref name=allmu16/> ''The Pixies—Sell Out'',<ref name=rhino/> ''The Pixies Acoustic: Live in Newport'',<ref name=dvdt/> and ''The Pixies Club Date: Live at the Paradise in Boston''.<ref name=dvdt2/>

The Pixies were ranked number 81 on VH1's ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''.

In 2013, Sean T. Rayburn, founder of PixiesMusic.com and friend to the band, launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the release of ''PIXIES: A Visual History, Volume 1'',<ref>cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/madtempest/pixies-a-visual-history-exclusive-ltd-ed-hardcover|title=PIXIES: A Visual History (Exclusive Ltd. Ed. Hardcover)|website=Kickstarter</ref> a limited edition hardcover, coffee-table size book, featuring hundreds of never-before-seen photos of the band. The Kickstarter edition of the book was limited to 3,500 numbered copies, all signed by Rayburn and Pixies singer Black Francis. Approximately one-quarter of these were also signed by designer Aaron Tanner. ''A Visual History'' went on to win several gold<ref>cite web|url=http://www.aafevv.com/addys/entry/pixies-visual-history-volume/|title=PIXIES: A Visual History, Volume I - American Advertising Awards, American Advertising Federation of Greater Evansville|publisher=</ref> and silver<ref>cite web|url=http://winners.americanadvertisingawards.com/awards2016/silver/|title=Silver - 2016 American Advertising Awards|website=winners.americanadvertisingawards.com</ref> publishing awards.
