The UK Albums Chart is a weekly record chart based on sales of albums in the United Kingdom; the term "Christmas number ones" refers to the records that are at the top of the chart on Christmas Day. Typically, the Christmas number one is the album that was announced as number one on the Sunday before 25 December. When Christmas Day falls on a Sunday itself, the official number one is the one announced on that day's chart.<ref>Cite web|url=http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/charts/comment.html|title=Chart Commentary from James Masterton|first=James|last=Masterton|authorlink=James Masterton|date=27 December 2005|publisher=LAUNCHcast|LAUNCH|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051229020725/http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/charts/comment.html|archivedate=29 December 2005|deadurl=yes|accessdate=28 June 2011</ref> As of|2017|12, 59 albums have been Christmas number ones.<ref name=Easier>Cite web|url=http://www.easier.com/30281-get-into-the-festive-spirit-with-music.html |title=Get Into The Festive Spirit With Music |date=20 December 2006 |publisher=Easier |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zQ3G1O7C?url=http://www.easier.com/30281-get-into-the-festive-spirit-with-music.html |archivedate=13 June 2011 |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 June 2011 |df= </ref>
