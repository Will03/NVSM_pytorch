Video game controversies are societal scientific arguments about whether the content of video games changes the behavior and attitudes of a player, and whether this is reflected in video game culture overall. Since the early 2000s, advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an games as art|expressive medium, arguing for their protection under the laws governing freedom of speech and also Video games in education|as an educational tool. Detractors argue that video games are harm principle|harmful and therefore should be Free speech limitations|subject to legislative oversight and restrictions. The positive and negative characteristics and effects of video games are the subject of scientific study. Results of investigations into links between video games and video game addiction|addiction, aggression, violence, psychosocial development|social development, and a variety of stereotyping and sexual morality issues are debated.<ref>Freedman J.

Background
The Entertainment Software Association reports that 17% of video game players are boys under the age of eighteen and that 36% are women over the age of eighteen, with 48% of all gamers being women of all ages.  They also report that the average age of gamers is 31.<ref>cite news|url=http://www.theesa.com/facts/index.asp |title=Industry Facts |publisher=Entertainment Software Association |date=28 November 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128145706/http://www.theesa.com/facts/index.asp |archivedate=November 28, 2014 </ref>  A survey of 1,102 children between 12 and 17 years of age found that 97% are video game players who have played in the last day and 75% of parents checked the censor's rating on a video game before allowing their child to purchase it. Of these children, 14% of girls and 50% of boys favored games with an "M" (mature) or "AO" (adult-only) rating.<ref>cite web|author=Martha Irvine |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/16/survey-97-percent-of-chil_n_126948.html |title=Survey: 97 Percent Of Children Play Video Games |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2015-02-18</ref> 32% of American adults play video games and as of 2007 the number was increasing.<ref>Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1751-2409.2007.00003.x| title = Public Policy and the Effects of Media Violence on Children| journal = Social Issues and Policy Review| volume = 1| pages = 15–61| year = 2007| last1 = Gentile | first1 = D.

Since the late 1990s, some acts of violence have been highly publicized in relation to beliefs the suspect in the crime may have had a history of playing violent video games.

Negative effects of video games
Theories of negative effects of video games tend to focus on players' modeling of behaviors observed in the game. These effects may be exacerbated due to the interactive nature of these games.  The most well known theory of such effects is the General Aggression Model (GAM), which proposes that playing violent video games may create cognitive scripts of aggression which will be activated in incidents in which individuals think others are acting with hostility.<ref>Cite journal|last=DeWall, Anderson & Bushman|first=|year=2011|title=The General Aggression Model: Theoretical Extensions to Violence|url=https://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/11DAB.pdf|journal=Psychology of Violence|volume=|pages=|via=</ref>   Playing violent video games, thus, becomes an opportunity to rehearse acts of aggression, which then become more common in real life.  The ''general aggression model'' suggests the simulated violence of video games may influence a player's thoughts, feelings and physical arousal, affecting individuals' interpretation of others' behavior and increasing their own aggressive behavior.<ref>Kooijmans T. [http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/kooijmans.html "Effects of video games on aggressive thoughts and behaviors during development."]''Rochester Institute of Technology'' December 2004.</ref>  Some scholars have criticized the general aggression model, arguing that the model wrongly assumes that aggression is primarily learned and that the brain does not distinguish reality from fiction.<ref>Cite journal|last=Ferguson & Dyck|first=|year=2012|title=Paradigm change in aggression research: The time has come to retire the General Aggression Model|url=http://christopherjferguson.com/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=17|pages=220–228|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.02.007</ref>  Some recent studies have explicitly claimed to find evidence against the GAM.<ref>Cite journal|last=Ballard|first=Mary|last2=Visser|first2=Kara|last3=Jocoy|first3=Kathleen|date=2012-11-19|title=Social Context and Video Game Play: Impact on Cardiovascular and Affective Responses|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271207163_Social_Context_and_Video_Game_Play_Impact_on_Cardiovascular_and_Affective_Responses|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=15|issue=6|pages=875–898|doi=10.1080/15205436.2011.632106|issn=1532-7825</ref><ref>Cite journal|last=Sauer|first=James D.|last2=Drummond|first2=Aaron|last3=Nova|first3=Natalie|date=2015-09-01|title=Violent video games: The effects of narrative context and reward structure on in-game and postgame aggression|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology.

Some biological theories of aggression have specifically excluded video game and other media effects because the evidence for such effects is considered weak and the impact too distant. For example, the ''catalyst model'' of aggression comes from a diathesis–stress model|diathesis-stress perspective, implying that aggression is due to a combination of genetic risk and environmental strain. The ''catalyst model'' suggests that stress, coupled with antisocial personality are salient factors leading to aggression. It does allow that proximal influences such as family or peers may alter aggressiveness but not media and games.<ref>Ferguson C. et al.

Primary studies

In 1998, Steven Kirsh reported in the journal ''Childhood'' that the use of video games may lead to acquisition of a ''hostile attribution bias''. Fifty-five subjects were randomised to play either violent or non-violent video games. Subjects were later asked to read stories in which the characters' behaviour was ambiguous. Participants randomised to play violent video games were more likely to provide negative interpretations of the stories.<ref name="third">cite journal|last=Kirsh|first=Steven|title=Seeing the world through Mortal Kombat-colored glasses: Violent video games and the development of a short-term Hostile Attribution Bias|journal=Childhood|year=1998|volume=5|issue=2|pages=177–184|doi=10.1177/0907568298005002005</ref> Another study done by Anderson and Dill in 2000 found a correlation in undergraduate students between playing violent video games and violent crime, with the correlation stronger in aggressive male players,<ref name="Anderson (2000)">Cite journal|title=Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|last1=Anderson|first1=Craig A.|first2=Dill|last2=Karen E.|date=April 2000|volume=78|issue=4|pages=772–790|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.4.772</ref> although other scholars have suggested that results from this study were not consistent, and that the methodology was flawed.<ref>Cite journal|last=Ferguson et al,|first=|year=2008|title=VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES AND AGGRESSION Causal Relationship or Byproduct of Family Violence and Intrinsic Violence Motivation?|url=http://christopherjferguson.com/CJBGames.pdf|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|volume=|pages=|via=</ref>

In 2003, a study was conducted at Iowa State University assessing pre-existing attitudes and violence in children.<ref>cite journal|last1=Funk|first1=J.B.|last2=Buchman|first2=D.D.|last3=Jenks|first3=J.|last4=Bechtoldt|first4=H.|title=Playing violent video games, desensitization, and moral evaluation in children|journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|date=2003|volume=24|issue=4|pages=413–416|doi=10.1016/S0193-3973(03)00073-X</ref>  The study concerned children between ages 5 and 12, and were assessed for the typical amount of time they played video games per week and pre-existing empathy and attitudes towards violence.  The children played a violent or non-violent video game for approximately fifteen minutes.  Afterwards, their pulse rates were recorded and the children were asked how frustrating the games were on a 1-10 scale.  Last, the children are given drawings (vignettes) of everyday situations, some more likely to have aggressive actions following the depiction, while others an empathetic action.  Results show that there were no significant effects of video game playing in the short term, with violent video games and non-violent video games having no significant differences, indicating that children do not have decreased empathy from playing violent video games.  Conversely, children who play more violent video games over a long period of time were associated with lower pre-existing empathy, and also lower scores on the empathy inducing vignettes, indicating long-term effects.  It is possible that video games had not primed children for the particular aggression scenarios.  This data could indicate desensitization in children can occur after long-term exposure, but not all children were affected in the same way, so the researchers deduced that some children may be at a higher risk of these negative effects.  It is possible that fifteen minutes is not quite long enough to produce short-term cognitive effects.

In 2003, Jeanne B. Funk and her colleagues at the Department of Psychology at the University of Toledo examined the relationship between exposure to violence through media and real-life, and desensitization (psychology)|desensitization (reflected by loss of empathy and changes in attitudes toward violence) in fourth and fifth grade pupils. Funk found that exposure to video game violence was associated with lowered empathy and stronger proviolence attitudes.<ref>cite journal|author=Funk J.

Another study from 2003, by John Colwell at the University of Westminster, found that violent video game playing was associated with reduced aggression among Japanese youth.<ref>Cite journal|last=Colwell|first=John|last2=Kato|first2=Makiko|date=2003-08-01|title=Investigation of the relationship between social isolation, self-esteem, aggression and computer game play in Japanese adolescents|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-839X.t01-1-00017/abstract|journal=Asian Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=149–158|doi=10.1111/1467-839X.t01-1-00017|issn=1467-839X</ref>

The American Psychological Association (APA) released an official statement in 2005, which said that exposure to violent media increases feelings of hostility, thoughts about aggression, suspicions about the motives of others, and demonstrates violence as a method to deal with potential conflict situations, that comprehensive analysis of violent interactive video game research suggests such exposure increases aggressive behavior, thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal, and decreases helpful behavior, and that studies suggest that sexualized violence in the media has been linked to increases in violence towards women, rape myth acceptance and anti-women attitudes. It also states that the APA advocates reduction of all violence in videogames and interactive media marketed to children and youth, that research should be made regarding the role of social learning, sexism, negative depiction of minorities, and gender on the effects of violence in video games and interactive media on children, adolescents, and young adults, and that it engages those responsible for developing violent video games and interactive media in addressing the issue that playing violent video games may increase aggressive thoughts and aggressive behaviors in children, youth, and young adults, and that these effects may be greater than the well documented effects of exposure to violent television and movies. They also recommend to the entertainment industry that the depiction of the consequences of violent behavior be associated with negative social consequences and that they support a rating system which accurately reflects the content of video games and interactive media. The statement was updated in 2015 (see below.)

Some scholars suggested that the APA's policy statement ignored discrepant research and misrepresented the scientific literature.<ref>cite web|url=http://onmediatheory.blogspot.com/2014/01/four-respond-to-228-responding-to-apa.html#!/2014/01/four-respond-to-228-responding-to-apa.html|title=On Media Theory...: UPDATE: Four Respond to 228, Responding to the APA: Dissent Within the Academy Regarding Media Violence (#ECA14 Panel)|publisher=Onmediatheory.blogspot.com|accessdate=17 February 2015</ref><ref>cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/68/2/57/|title=Violent video games and the Supreme Court: Lessons for the scientific community in the wake of Brown v.

In 2005, a study by Bruce D. Bartholow and colleagues at the University of Missouri, University of Michigan, Vrije Universiteit, and University of North Carolina using event related potential linked video game violence exposure to brain processes hypothetically reflecting desensitization. The authors suggested that chronic exposure to violent video games have lasting harmful effects on brain function and behavior.<ref>B.D. Bartholow, et al.

In 2007, a study at Iowa State University, the University of Michigan, and Vrije Universiteit by Nicholas L. Carnagey and colleagues found that participants who had previously played a violent video game had lower heart rate and galvanic skin response while viewing filmed real violence, demonstrating a physiological desensitization to violence.<ref>Nicholas L.

In 2007, a study at the Swinburne University of Technology found that children had variable reactions to violent games, with some kids becoming more aggressive, some becoming less aggressive, but the majority showing no changes in behavior.<ref>[http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/04/study_kids_unaf.html "Kids unaffected by violent games."] Wired, 2 April 2007.</ref>

In 2008, a longitudinal study conducted in Japan assessed possible long-term effects of video game playing in children.<ref>cite journal|last1=Shibuya|first1=A.|last2=Sakamoto|first2=A.|last3=Ihori|first3=N.|last4=Yukawa|first4=S.|title=The effects of the presence and contexts of video game violence in children: A longitudinal study in Japan|journal=Simulation & Gaming|date=2008|volume=39|issue=4|pages=528–539|doi=10.1177/1046878107306670</ref> The final analysis consisted of 591 fifth graders aged 10–11 across eight public elementary schools, and was conducted over the course of a year.  Initially, children were asked to complete a survey which assessed presence or absence of violence in the children's favorite video games, as well as video game context variables that may affect the results and the aggression levels of the children.  Children were assessed again for these variables a year later.  Results reveal that there is a significant difference in gender, with boys showing significantly more aggressive behavior and anger than girls, which was attributed by the authors to boys elevated interest in violent video games.  However the interaction between time spent gaming and preference for violent games was associated with reduced aggression in boys but not girls.  The researchers also found that eight context variables they assessed increased aggression, including unjustified violence, availability of weapons, and rewards. Three context variables, role-playing, extent of violence, and humor, were associated with decreased aggression.  It is unknown if the observed changes from the two surveys are actually contextual effects.  The researchers found that the context and quality of the violence in video games affects children more than simply presence and amount of violence, and these effects are different from child to child.

In 2008 the Pew Internet and American Life Project statistically examined the impact of video gaming on youths' social and communal behaviors. Teens who had communal gaming experiences reported much higher levels of civic and political engagement than teens who had not had these kinds of experiences. Youth who took part in social interaction related to the game, such as commenting on websites or contributing to discussion boards, were more engaged communally and politically. Among teens who play games, 63% reported seeing or hearing "people being mean and overly aggressive while playing," 49% reported seeing or hearing "people being hateful, racist or sexist while playing", and 78% reported witnessing "people being generous or helpful while playing".<ref>cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2008/09/16/teens-video-games-and-civics/|title=Teens, Video Games and Civics|date=16 September 2008|work=Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project|accessdate=17 February 2015</ref><ref>cite journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519093724/https://tamiu.edu/newsinfo/newsarticles/documents/video_game_study.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-19|url=https://tamiu.edu/newsinfo/newsarticles/documents/video_game_study.pdf|title=Call of (civic) duty: Action games and civic behavior in a large sample of youth|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=27|issue=2|date=March 2011|pages=770–775|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.026|author1=Christopher J.

In 2009, a report of three studies conducted among students of different age groups in Singapore, Japan, and the United States, found that prosocial mostly nonviolent games increased helpful prosocial behaviour among the participants.<ref>cite journal|author1=Douglas A. Gentile|displayauthors=etal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678173/pdf/nihms-104172.pdf|title=The Effects of Prosocial Video Games on Prosocial Behaviors: International Evidence From Correlational, Longitudinal, and Experimental Studies|pmc=2678173|doi=10.1177/0146167209333045|pmid=19321812|volume=35|journal=Pers Soc Psychol Bull|pages=752–63|year=2009</ref>

In 2010, Patrick and Charlotte Markey suggested that violent video games only caused aggressive feelings in individuals who had a preexisting disposition, such as high neuroticism, low agreeableness, or low conscientiousness.<ref>[http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/gpr-14-2-82.pdf "Video Game Violence Use Among "Vulnerability to violent video games: A review and integration of personality research."]</ref>

In 2010, after a review of the effects of violent video games, the Attorney general#Australia|Attorney General's Office of Australia reported that even though the Anderson meta-analysis of 2010 was the pinnacle of the scientific debate at that time, significant harm from violent video games had not been persuasively proven or disproven, except that there was some consensus that they might be harmful to people with aggressive or psychotic personality traits.<ref name="Australia (2010)">[http://www.apa.org/divisions/div46/Australian%20Govt_2010_Literature%20review%20on%20the%20impact%20of%20playing%20violent%20video%20games%20on%20aggression.pdf "Literature review on the impact of playing violent video games on aggression"] Australian government 2010.</ref>

The attorney general considered a number of issues including:
* Social and political controversy about the topic.
* Lack of consensus about definitions and measures of aggression and violent video games (for example, whether a cartoon game has the same impact as a realistic one).
* Levels of aggression may or may not be an accurate marker for the likelihood of violent behaviour.
* The playing of violent video games may not be an independent variable in determining violent acts (for example, violent behaviour after playing violent video games may be age dependant, or players of violent video games may watch other violent media).
* Studies may not have been long or large enough to provide clear conclusions.<ref name="Australia (2010)"/>

In 2010, researchers Paul Adachi and Teena Willoughby at Brock University critiqued experimental video game studies on both sides of the debate, noting that experimental studies often confounded violent content with other variables such as competitiveness.<ref>Cite journal|last=Adachi|first=Paul J.

In 2011, a thirty-year study of 14,000 college students, published by the University of Michigan which measured overall empathy levels in students, found that these had dropped by 40% since the 1980s. The biggest drop came after the year 2000, which the authors speculated was due to multiple factors, including increased societal emphasis on selfishness, changes in parenting practices, increased isolation due to time spent with information technology, and greater immersion in all forms of violent and/or narcissistic media including, but not limited to, news, television and video games.  The authors did not provide data on media effects, but referenced various research of the topics.<ref>Sarah H. Konrath. Edward H. O'Brien. Courtney Hsing.

In 2011, in a longitudinal study of youth in Germany, von Salisch found that aggressive children tend to select more violent video games. This study found no evidence that violent games caused aggression in minors. The author speculated that other studies may have been affected by "single responder bias" due to self-reporting of aggression rather than reporting by parents or teachers.<ref>cite journal | last1 = Von Salisch | first1 = M.| year = 2011 | title = Preference for violent electronic games and aggressive behavior among children: the beginning of the downward spiral? | url = | journal = Media Psychology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 233–258 | doi = 10.1080/15213269.2011.596468 |display-authors=etal</ref>

In 2012 a Swedish study examined the cooperative behavior of players in ''The Lord of the Rings Online''. The authors argued that attempts to link collaborative or aggressive behavior within the game to real life behavior would rely on unwarranted assumptions regarding equivalencies of forms of cooperation and the material conditions of the environment in-game and out-of-game.<ref>cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11412-011-9136-6 | title=How gamers manage aggression: Situating skills in collaborative computer games | journal=International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning | date=2011 | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=43–61 | first=Ulrika | last=Bennerstedt</ref>

One study from Morgan Tear and Mark Nielsen in 2013 concluded that violent video games did not reduce or increase prosocial behavior, failing to replicated previous studies in this area.<ref name="plosone.org" />

In 2013, Isabela Granic and colleagues at Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands, argued that even violent video games may promote learning, health, and social skills, but that not enough games had been developed to treat mental health problems. Granic et al. noted that both camps have valid points, and a more balanced perspective and complex picture is necessary.<ref>Granic G. et al.

In 2014, Ferguson and Olson found no correlation between video game violence and bullying or delinquency in children with preexisting attention deficit disorder or depressive symptoms.<ref>cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10964-013-9986-5|title=Video Game Violence Use Among "Vulnerable" Populations: The Impact of Violent Games on Delinquency and Bullying Among Children with Clinically Elevated Depression or Attention Deficit Symptoms|accessdate=17 February 2015|doi=10.1007/s10964-013-9986-5|pmid=23975351|volume=43|issue=1|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|pages=127–136|year=2013|last1=Ferguson|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Olson|first2=Cheryl K.</ref>

In 2014, Villanova professor Patrick M. Markey conducted a study with 118 teenagers suggesting that video games have no influence on increased aggression of users; however, he did find that when used for the right amount of time (roughly 1 hour) video games came make children nicer and more socially interactive. This information was provided by the teens teachers at their local schools.<ref>Cite web|title = Villanova Professor: Violent video games don't cause real life violence in most cases|url = http://www.timesherald.com/lifestyle/20140930/villanova-professor-violent-video-games-dont-cause-real-life-violence-in-most-cases|website = www.timesherald.com|accessdate = 2015-10-20</ref>Unreliable source?|date=May 2017

A 2014 study by Andrew Przybylski at Oxford University examined the impact of violent content and frustration on hostility among video game players.  In a series of experiments, Przybylski and colleagues demonstrated that frustration, but not violent content, increased player hostility.  The authors also demonstrated that some previous "classic" violent video game experiments were difficult to replicate.<ref>cite journal | doi = 10.1037/a0034820 | pmid=24377357 | title=Competence-impeding electronic games and players' aggressive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors | journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | date=2014 | volume=106 | issue=3 | pages=441–457 | first=Andrew | last=Przybylski</ref>

One longitudinal study from 2014 suggested that violent video games were associated with very small increases in risk taking behavior over time.<ref>Cite journal|last=Hull|first=Jay G.|last2=Brunelle|first2=Timothy J.|last3=Prescott|first3=Anna T.|last4=Sargent|first4=James D.|date=2014-08-01|title=A longitudinal study of risk-glorifying video games and behavioral deviance|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=2|pages=300–325|doi=10.1037/a0036058|issn=1939-1315|pmc=4151190|pmid=25090130</ref>

In 2015, the American Psychological Association released a review that found that violent video games caused aggressive behavior, with Mark Appelbaum, the chair of the task force that conducted the review, saying that "the link between violence in video games and increased aggression in players is one of the most studied and best established in the field." However, Appelbaum also characterized the size of the correlation as "not very big". The same review found insufficient evidence of a link between such video games and crime or delinquency. Critics, including Peter Gray and Christopher Ferguson, expressed concerns about methodological limitations of the review. Ferguson stated that "I think (the task force members) were selected because their opinions were pretty clear going in." At least four of the seven task force members had previously expressed opinions on the topic; critics argued this alone constitutes a conflict of interest, while a task force member defended that "If it were common practice to exclude all scientists after they render one conclusion, the field would be void of qualified experts".<ref>cite web | url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/violent-video-games.aspx | title=APA Review Confirms Link Between Playing Violent Video Games and Aggression | work=American Psychological Association | date=13 August 2015 | accessdate=16 December 2015</ref><ref>cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/apa-video-games-violence-364394|title=APA Says Video Games Make You Violent, but Critics Cry Bias|publisher=Newsweek|date=20 August 2015|accessdate=19 December 2015</ref>

A 2015 study examined the impact of violent video games on young adults players with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The study found no evidence for an impact of playing such games on aggression among ASD players.  These results appeared to contradict concerns following the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, that individuals with ASD or other mental conditions might be particularly susceptible to violent video game effects.<ref>cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0956797615583038| pmid=26113064| title=Effects of violent-video-game exposure on aggressive behavior, aggressive-thought accessibility, and aggressive affect among adults with and without autism spectrum disorder| journal=Psychological Science| date=2015 | volume=26 | issue=8 | pages=1187–1200 | first=Christopher| last=Engelhardt</ref>

One study from 2016 suggested that "sexist" games (using games from the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series as exemplars) may reduce empathy toward women.  Although no direct game effect was found, the authors argued that an interaction between game condition, masculine role norms, gender and avatar identification produced enough evidence to claim causal effects. Comments by other scholars on this study reflect some concerns over the methodology including a possible failure of the randomization to game conditions (see comments tab).<ref>Cite journal|last=Gabbiadini|first=Alessandro|last2=Riva|first2=Paolo|last3=Andrighetto|first3=Luca|last4=Volpato|first4=Chiara|last5=Bushman|first5=Brad J.|date=2016-04-13|title=Acting like a Tough Guy: Violent-Sexist Video Games, Identification with Game Characters, Masculine Beliefs, & Empathy for Female Violence Victims|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152121|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0152121|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0152121|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4830454|pmid=27074057|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1152121G</ref>

In 2016, a preregistered study of violent video game effects concluded that violent video games did not influence aggression in players.<ref name="McCarthy 13–19"/>  The preregistered nature of the study removed the potential for the scholars to "nudge" the results of the study in favor of the hypothesis and suggests that preregistration of future studies may help clarify results in the field.

Meta-analyses
Because the results of individual studies have often reached different conclusions, debate has often shifted to the use of meta-analysis. This method attempts to average across individual studies, determine whether there is some effect on average, and test possible explanations for differences between study results.

A number of meta-analyses have been conducted, at times reaching different conclusions. A 2001 meta-analysis reviewing the relationship between video game violence and aggression in teenagers (n = 3,033) found a significant and positive correlation, indicating that high video game violence does lead to greater aggression among teenagers.<ref name="Anderson (2001)" />

Another meta-analysis conducted the same year by John Sherry was more skeptical of effects, specifically questioning whether the interactivity of video games made them have more effect than other media.<ref name="Sherry (2001)" /> Sherry later published another meta-analysis in 2007, again concluding that the influence of video game violence on aggression was minimal. Sherry also criticized the observed dose-response curve,  reporting that smaller effects were found in experimental studies with longer exposure times, where one might expect greater exposure to cause greater effects.<ref>Sherry J. "Mass media effects research: advances through meta-analysis." 2007 p244. "[http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2006-12100-015 Violent Video Games and Aggression: Why Can't We Find Effects?]"</ref>

In 2010, Anderson's group published a meta-analysis of one hundred and thirty international studies with over 130,000 participants. He reported that exposure to violent video games caused both short-term and long-term aggression in players and decreased empathy and pro-social behavior.<ref>Anderson C. et al.

fMRI studies
Some scholars worry there may be an effect of violent video games on brain activity, although such concerns are highly contentious. Some scientists have attempted to use functional magnetic resonance imaging to study this hypothesis. Some studies suggested that participants who engaged with VVGs displayed increases in the functioning of their amygdala and decreases in the functioning of their frontal lobe.<ref name="first">cite journal|last=Wendling|first=Patrice|title=Violent videos alter brain functioning, study shows|journal=Internal Medicine News|date=February 2007|volume=40|issue=3|page=20|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA171952399&v=2.1&u=utoronto_main&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w|doi=10.1016/s1097-8690(07)70088-4subscription needed</ref> Some scholars argue that the effect on the frontal lobe may be similar to the deactivation seen in disruptive behavior disorders.<ref>cite journal|last=Jarrett|first=Christian|title=Neural effects of media violence|journal=Psychologist|date=August 2005|volume=18|issue=8|page=462|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/211742666</ref><ref>cite journal|last=Kalnin|first=A.

Further, other studies have failed to find a link between violent games and diminished brain function.  For example, an fMRI study by Regenbogen and colleagues suggested VVGs do not diminish the ability to differentiate between real and virtual violence.<ref>cite journal|title=The neural processing of voluntary completed, real and virtual violent and nonviolent computer game scenarios displaying predefined actions in gamers and nongamers|author1=Regenbogen C. |author2=Herrmann M. |author3=Fehr T. |doi=10.1080/17470910903315989|year=2010|volume=5|issue=2|pages=221–40|pmid=19823959|journal=Society for Neuroscience</ref>  Another study from 2016 using fMRI found no evidence that VVGs led to a desensitization effect in players.<ref>Cite journal|last=Szycik|first=Gregor R.|last2=Mohammadi|first2=Bahram|last3=Hake|first3=Maria|last4=Kneer|first4=Jonas|last5=Samii|first5=Amir|last6=Münte|first6=Thomas F.|last7=Wildt|first7=Bert T. te|date=2016-04-16|title=Excessive users of violent video games do not show emotional desensitization: an fMRI study|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-016-9549-y|journal=Brain Imaging and Behavior|language=en|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s11682-016-9549-y|issn=1931-7557</ref>  In a recent BBC interview, Dr. Simone Kuhn explained that the brain effects seen in prior fMRI studies likely indicated that players were simply able to distinguish between reality and fiction and modulate their emotional reaction accordingly, not becoming desensitized.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06cjypk|title=Are Video Games Really That Bad?, 2014-2015, Horizon - BBC Two|website=BBC|access-date=2017-01-03</ref>

Studies on the effect on crime
In 2008, records held by the US Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and Office of Justice Programs indicated that arrests for violent crime in the US had decreased since the early 1990s in both children and adults.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/JAR.asp |title=Juvenile Arrest Rates |publisher=Ojjdp.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/gvc.htm#serious|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211201006/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/gvc.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|archivedate=December 11, 2009 |publisher=Ojp.usdoj.gov|accessdate=17 February 2015</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/tables/4meastab.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211203117/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/tables/4meastab.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|archivedate=December 11, 2009 |publisher=Ojp.usdoj.gov|accessdate=17 February 2015</ref> This decrease occurred despite increasing sales of violent video games and increases in graphically violent content in those games.<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080514213432.htm "Could violent video games reduce rather than increase violence?"] Science Daily website 15 May 2008.

Studies of mass shootings have, likewise, provided no evidence for links with violent video games.  A 2002 report from the US Secret Service found that school shooters appeared to consume relatively low levels of violent media.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf|title=Final Report and Findings of the Safe Schools Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=US Secret Service and US Department of Education|access-date=2017-01-03</ref>  Some criminologists have specifically referred to claims linking violent video games to mass shootings as a "myth".<ref>Cite journal|last=Fox|first=J.

Some studies have examined the consumption of violent video games in society and violent crime rates.  Generally, it is acknowledged that societal violent video game consumption has been associated with over an 80% reduction in youth violence in the US during the corresponding period.<ref>Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Christopher J.|date=2014-11-01|title=Does Media Violence Predict Societal Violence?

Other studies have examined data on violent video games and crime trends more closely and have come to the conclusion that the release of very popular violent video games are causally associated with corresponding declines in violent crime in the short term.  A 2011 study by the Center for European Economic Research<ref name="ceer">cite web | url=https://www.econstor.eu/dspace/bitstream/10419/48154/1/663765870.pdf | title=Understanding the effects of violent video games on violent crime | publisher=Center for European Economic Research | work=ZEW Discussion Papers 11-042 | date=2011 | accessdate=11 November 2014 |author1=Cunningham, A. Scott |author2=Engelstätter, Benjamin |author3=Ward, Michael R. | page=25</ref> found that violent video games may be reducing crime.  This is possibly because the time spent playing games reduces time spent engaged in more antisocial activities.  Other recent studies by Patrick Markey<ref>Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/ppm/4/4/277/|title=Violent video games and real-world violence: Rhetoric versus data|doi=10.1037/ppm0000030|author1=Markey, Patrick M.|author2=Markey, Charlotte N.|author3=French, Juliana E.|journal=Psychology of Popular Media Culture|volume=4|issue=4|date=Oct 2015|pp=277–295|access-date=2017-01-03</ref> and Scott Cunningham<ref>Cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=Scott|last2=Engelstätter|first2=Benjamin|last3=Ward|first3=Michael R.|date=2016-04-01|title=Violent Video Games and Violent Crime|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/soej.12139/abstract|journal=Southern Economic Journal|language=en|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1247–1265|doi=10.1002/soej.12139|issn=2325-8012</ref> have come to similar conclusions.

In 2008, in ''Grand Theft Childhood|Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do'', Lawrence Kutner (psychologist)|Kutner and Cheryl K. Olson|Olsen refuted claims that violent video games cause an increase in violent behavior in children. They report there is a scientifically non-significant trend showing that adolescents who do not play video games at all are most at risk for violent behavior and video game play is part of an adolescent boy's normal social setting. However, the authors did not completely deny the negative influences of violent (M-rated) video games on pre-teens and teenagers: Kutner and Olson suggested the views of alarmists and those of representatives of the video game industry are often supported by flawed or misconstrued studies and that the factors leading to violence in children and adolescents were more subtle than whether or not they played violent video games.<ref>Kutner L and Olsen C.

Henry Jenkins, an academic in media studies, said,
:"According to federal crime statistics, the rate of juvenile violent crime in the United States is at a 30-year low. Researchers find that people serving time for violent crimes typically consume less media before committing their crimes than the average person in the general population. It's true that young offenders who have committed school shootings in America have also been game players. But young people in general are more likely to be gamers—90 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls play. The overwhelming majority of kids who play do ''not'' commit antisocial acts. According to a 2001 U.S. Surgeon General's report, the strongest risk factors for school shootings centered on mental stability and the quality of home life, not media exposure. The moral panic over violent video games is doubly harmful. It has led adult authorities to be more suspicious and hostile to many kids who already feel cut off from the system. It also misdirects energy away from eliminating the actual causes of youth violence and allows problems to continue to fester."<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impact/myths.html "The video game revolution: eight myths about video games debunked."] PBS Impact of gaming essays webpage.

In 2013, Corey Mead, a professor of English at Baruch College, wrote about how the U.S. military financed the original development of video games, and has long used them for both training, recruitment purposes, and treatment of post traumatic stress disorder.

Video games, particularly violent ones, are often mentioned as a cause for major gun crimes in the wake of school shooting by young adults. For example, Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old shooter at the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, was found to have numerous video games in his possession, leading for some people to blame video games for the shooting;<ref>cite news|url=http://ideas.time.com/2012/12/20/sandy-hook-shooting-video-games-blamed-again/ |title=Sandy Hook Shooting: Video Games Blamed, Again |work=Time |last=Ferguson |first=Christopher J. |date=December 20, 2012 |accessdate=November 11, 2013</ref> however, the State Attorney did not link video game to the event in their final report of the incident, though identified that video game addiction may have been connected.<ref name = "final_report">cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/csao/lib/csao/Sandy_Hook_Final_Report.pdf|title=Sandy Hook Final Report.

On 7 January 2009, Joe Baca, representative of California's 43rd District, introduced H.R. 231, the ''Video game health labelling act''. This bill called for a label to be placed in a "clear and conspicuous location on the packaging" on all video games with an ESRB rating of T (Teen) or higher stating,
"WARNING: Excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior."<ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr231ih/pdf/BILLS-111hr231ih.pdf "H.R. 231, Video game health labelling act."] Congressional bills, GPO access.</ref><ref>Baca J.

On 27 June 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled on ''Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association''. Video games were protected speech under the First Amendment. The case centered on a California law that sought to restrict sales of violent video games to minors. The video game industry, led by the Entertainment Merchants Association and the Entertainment Software Association, successfully obtained an injunction on the bill, believing that the definition of violence as stated in the California law was too vague and would not treat video games as protected speech. This opinion was upheld in lower courts, and supported by the Supreme Court's decision. The majority of the justices did not consider the studies brought to their attention as convincing evidence of harm, and stated that they could not create a new class of restricted speech that was not applied to other forms of media.<ref name="sblog.s3.amazonaws.com"/><ref>O'Sullivan S.

Tolerance of sexual themes and content in video game content varies between nations.citation needed|date=March 2014 Controversy over sexual themes has occurred in the US. For instance, in June 2005, an entire portion of unused code was found within the main script of ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'', allowing the player to simulate sexual intercourse with the main character's girlfriends. This mode, entitled ''Hot Coffee'', could be accessed in the PC version via Mod (computer gaming)|mod, and through Datel Action Replay|Action Replay codes in the PlayStation 2|PS2 and Xbox (console)|Xbox versions.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/07/15/news_6129301.html|title=Confirmed: Sex minigame in PS2 San Andreas|publisher=Gamespot.com|accessdate=18 February 2015</ref> The scene was left on the disc and could be accessed by altering a few bytes of the game's code via hex editor. This feature prompted the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) to change the rating of San Andreas on 20 July 2005 to "adults only". Furthermore, the game was withdrawn from sale in many stores. Rockstar Games posted a loss of $28.8 million in that financial quarter. This event was dubbed the Hot Coffee mod controversy.<ref>Fisher K.

In 1998, a study by Dietz, conducted at the University of Central Florida, found that of thirty-three games sampled, 41% did not feature female characters, 28% sexually objectified women, 21% depicted violence against women, and 30% did not represent the female population at all. Furthermore, characterizations of women tended to be stereotypical: highly sexualized ("visions of beauty with large breasts and hips"), dependent ("victim or as the proverbial ''Damsel in Distress''"), opponents ("evil or as obstacles to the goal of the game"), and trivial ("females depicted in fairly non-significant roles").<ref>Dietz T.

In 2002, Kennedy considered the characteristics of the character, Lara Croft in the ''Tomb Raider'' video game series. She is presented as a beautiful, clever, athletic, and brave English archaeologist-adventurer. Lara Croft has achieved popularity with both males and females as an action heroine, although depending on what perspective is applied she can either represent 'a positive role model for young girls' or a 'combination of eye and thumb candy for the boys'.<ref>Kennedy H.

Dietz's findings are supported by a survey commissioned in 2003 by ''Children Now''. The survey found that gender stereotypes pervade most video games: male characters (52%) were more likely than females (32%) to engage in physical aggression; nearly 20% of female characters were hyper-sexualized in some way, while 35% of male characters were extremely muscular.<ref>Espejo R.

Male characters are portrayed as hard bodied, muscled men while female characters are portrayed as soft bodied, nearly naked women with large breasts, portrayed in a narrowly stereotypical manner. Females are usually constructed as visual objects in need of protection who wait for male rescue, whereas men are portrayed with more power. According to Flew, such depiction of females in games reflects underlying social ideas of male dominance and themes of masculinity. Although not all video games contain such stereotypes, Flew suggests that there are enough to make it a general trait and that "...different genders have different gaming."<ref>Flew T. and Humphreys S.

In the 2000s, China introduced boot camps combining forced physical exercise and various forms of shock torture to try and cure kids who have been addicted to internet use and videogames. Most of the kids did not come there voluntary and were either forced to go either by parents or by police. This has come under great criticism by industry giants and other countries. In 2009, officials reported plans to discontinue use of electroshock therapy, though the camps still remain open.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/world/asia/china-internet-addiction-electroshock-therapy.html|title=Electroshock Therapy for Internet Addicts?

Main|Digital rights management

Digital rights management (DRM) is a type of technology that is intended to control the use of digital content and devices after purchase.  Many companies make use of DRM to prevent Copyright and video games|copyright infringement and to protect an entity's intellectual property from public access.<ref>"The pros, cons, and future of DRM". Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 7 August 2009. Accessed 7 January 2012.</ref>  Opponents of DRM argue that it only inconveniences legitimate customers and allows big business to stifle innovation and competition. In the US, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 increased the strength of DRM.<ref>[https://www.eff.org/issues/drm "DRM."] Electronic Frontier Foundation.

=Online harassment=
See also|Cyberbullying#In gaming|Sexism in video gaming
A further issue that can occur through gaming is online harassment or bullying behaviors.  A specific example of harassing behavior occurring within a game can be found in Xbox Live services. With its online chat and party system, this leaves the service open to unwanted harassment, trolling, or bullying to occur between players. To address these concerns, Microsoft made improvements with reputation levels for a player's Xbox Live account. The system is set to warn, then punish bad behavior in hopes of better regulating Xbox Live accounts.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2014/03/28/xbox-live-to-warn-then-punish-bad-behavior/ |title=Xbox Live to Warn, then Punish Bad Behavior |publisher=TechnoBuffalo |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2015-02-18</ref>

The anonymous nature of the internet may be a factor of encouraging anti-social behavior. This type of behavior expands to other parts of the internet separate from gaming, such as online forums, social media sites, etc. Lack of accountability for one's actions on the internet may encourage others to engage in harassing behavior. Without minimal threat of punishment, some may find it easier to carry out negative behavior over online gaming.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs6461/www/Reading/Davenport02.pdf |format=PDF |title=Anonymity on the Internet: Why the Price May Be Too High |publisher=Csl.mtu.edu |accessdate=18 February 2015</ref>

Regarding whether attitudes towards women in games and gaming culture extend as far as misogyny, opinions have been divided.

Publicized incidents

=In the United States=
Many incidents in the United States that are speculated to be related to video games have helped fuel controversy, starting with Noah Wilson.

On 22 November 1997, Noah Wilson, aged 13, died when his friend, Yancy, stabbed him in the chest with a kitchen knife. Wilson's mother, Andrea Wilson, alleged her son was stabbed to death because of an obsession with the 1995 Midway Games|Midway game ''Mortal Kombat 3''; that Yancy was so obsessed with the game that he believed himself to be the character, Cyrax, who uses a Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|finishing move which Wilson claims involves taking the opponent in a headlock and stabbing them in the chest, despite the fact that Cyrax has never used this Fatality in any game he has appeared in. The court found "Wilson's complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted."<ref>''[https://www.webcitation.org/5mG1Vbyra?url=http://www.unc.edu/~dlthomas/Videogames/Midway%20Games.pdf Wilson v. Midway Games, Inc.]'' 198 F.Supp.2d 167, 27 March 2002.</ref>

There have also been video game-related crimes which took place at schools. On 24 March 1998, Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden|13-year-old Mitchell Johnson and 11-year-old Andrew Golden killed 4 students and a teacher in the Westside Middle School massacre. Although no connection to video games was drawn by the press at the time, the case was re-examined by commentators a year later, subsequent to the events of the Columbine High School massacre, and it was determined that the two boys had often played ''GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007'' together and they enjoyed playing first-person shooter games.<ref>Kent S.

2000s
Video games sparked controversy again when, in November 2001, at the age of twenty-one, Shawn Woolley committed suicide in a state his mother claimed was an addiction to ''EverQuest''. Woolley's mother said,
:"I think the way the game is written is that when you first start playing it, it is fun, and you make great accomplishments. And then the further you get into it, the higher level you get, the longer you have to stay on it to move onward, and then it isn't fun anymore. But by then you're addicted, and you can't leave it."<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/17/48hours/main525965.shtml "Addicted: suicide over Everquest?"] CBS News 18 September 2002.</ref>

In 1994, a study conducted by the University of California in which fifth graders played extensive hours of video games, they managed to gain better spatial skills.<ref>cite journal|last1=Subrahmanyam|first1=K.|last2=Greenfield|first2=P.M.|title=Effects of video game practice on spatial skills in girls and boys|journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|date=1994|volume=15|issue=1|pages=13–32|doi=10.1016/0193-3973(94)90004-3</ref>  The children were split into two groups, with the experimental group playing ''Marble Madness'', while the control group played ''Conjecture''.  The distinction is important because ''Marble Madness'' requires spatial skills while ''Conjecture'' does not.  The results may not be generalizable, since the sample of kids is taken from a single private school, and may not necessarily be representative of the population.  The children practiced their respective game for forty-five minutes per session for three sessions, all on separate days.  Appropriate pre- and post-tests were also assessed for spatial ability, on the day before and after the sessions. Irrespective of gender, practicing ''Marble Madness'' significantly increased spatial ability, especially in the children who had low performance on the spatial ability pre-test.  Conversely, playing ''Conjecture'' did not increase children's spatial skills.  This indicates that the type of game is important to consider when changes to cognitive abilities appear to be present.  It is unknown if these increases in spatial ability persist into the long-term.  This could mean that any benefits to practicing may only last if practice sessions are done at least intermittently.

=Relief from stress=
Olsen suggests video games can have social benefits for children, for example, video games can provide a topic of discussion and something over which children can bond, and can help children make friends; playing video games can increase a child's self-esteem when they are struggling in one aspect of their life, but are able to do something correctly in a video game; and, children can also learn to take on leadership roles within a multi-player online game.<ref>cite journal|author=Olsen C. |url=http://dmlcentral.net/sites/dmlcentral/files/resource_files/Olson_Motivations_for_Play_final.pdf|title=Children's motivation for video game play in the context of normal development|journal= Review of General Psychology|year=2010|volume=14|issue=2|pages=180–187|accessdate=28 October 2013|doi=10.1037/a0018984|publisher=American Psychological Association</ref> Christopher Ferguson, a psychologist well known for his video game research, conducted a study in which results suggest that violent games reduce depression and hostile feelings in players through mood management.<ref>cite web|author=Ferguson, C.|date=June 17, 2010|publisher=Texas A&M International University |accessdate=November 13, 2015|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/newsinfo/7-08-10/article5.shtml|title=Violent Video Games Help Relieve Stress, Depression, Says TAMIU Professor</ref>

According to a research paper done by Radboud University, creating positive emotions help to build motivation, relationships, and cope with failure. It also helps to monitor negative emotions such as anger, frustration or anxiety and control these emotions in order to achieve a goal (Isabela Granic, Adam Lobel, and Rutger C.M.E. Engels). By learning to motivate themselves, students could push themselves to achieve goals and improve their performance academically as they would improve their performance similarly in their video games. Also, social games that rely on interactions with other people would promote healthy relationships and better communication between their fellow students, teachers and others outside of school. This could also benefit the students to work harder in class to achieve better grades and learn from their mistakes and improve rather than become frustrated.  As video games are a favored pastime among many students, having a game that promotes positive emotions will help to alleviate stress in the classroom, making the environment fun and sociable.<ref>cite web|last1=Granic|first1=Isabela|last2=Lobel|first2=Adam|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger|title=The Benefit of Playing Video Games|url=https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-a0034857.pdf|website=American Psychologist|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=20 November 2016|date=January 2014</ref>

Not all video games are mindless. According to John L. Sherry, assistant professor at Michigan State University, 'educators are increasingly using educational games in the classroom as a motivational tool. The right video games help children master everything from basic grammar to complex math without the drudgery of old-school flash cards.'<ref>cite web|url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/positive-effects-video-games-children-16317.html |title=Positive Effects of Video Games on Children &#124; Everyday Life - Global Post |publisher=Everydaylife.globalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18</ref>

Certain studies indicate that video games may have value in terms of academic performance, perhaps because of the skills that are developed in the process. "When you play ... games you're solving puzzles to move to the next level and that involves using some of the general knowledge and skills in maths, reading and science that you've been taught during the day," said Alberto Posso, an Associate Professor at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, after analysing data from the results of standardized testing completed by over 12,000 high school students across Australia. As summarized by ''The Guardian'',<ref>cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Samuel |date=August 8, 2016 |title=Positive link between video games and academic performance, study suggests  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/08/positive-link-between-video-games-and-academic-performance-study-suggests |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |access-date=August 9, 2016</ref> the study [published in the ''International Journal of Communication''], "found that students who played online games almost every day scored 15 points above average in maths and reading tests and 17 points above average in science". However, the reporter also stated that "[the] methodology cannot prove that playing video games were the cause of the improvement". ''The Guardian'' also reported that a Columbia University study indicated that extensive video gaming by students in the 6 to 11 age group provided a greatly increased chance of high intellectual functioning and overall school competence.

In a study done in 2017 by the International Conference Educational Technologies they explored the educational purposes of the video game Minecraft. The results that they concluded from this experiment was that it increased collaboration between groups, increased problem solving skills, improved computer skills and more.<ref>https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED579314.pdf</ref>

In an interview with CNN, Edward Castronova, a professor of Telecommunications at Indiana University Bloomington said he was not surprised by the outcome of the Australian study but also discussed the issue of causal connection. "Though there is a link between gaming and higher math and science scores, it doesn't mean playing games caused the higher scores. It could just be that kids who are sharp are looking for a challenge, and they don't find it on social media, and maybe they do find it on board games and video games," he explained.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/08/health/video-games-teens/ |title=Teen gamers do better at math than social media stars, study says |last=Scutti |first=Susan |date=August 8, 2016 |website=CNN Health |publisher= |access-date=August 9, 2016 |quote=Video games' bad reputation may be unfair.

=Business skills=
In 1997, Herz and in 2006, Wade and Beck, authors, suggested video game playing may increase entrepreneurial skills. Herz argued that many so-called negative effects of video games, such as aggression and lack of pro-social behavior, are both necessary and useful traits to have in a capitalistic society. Specifically, Herz argued that many academic researchers have an anti-capitalist bias, and thus failed to notice the benefits of such traits.<ref>Wade J. and Beck M.

In 2012, a study approved by Iowa State University assessed whether prosocial games could promote helpful behavior in children.  In this study, children aged 9–14 years old played three different types of video games.<ref>cite journal|last1=Saleem|first1=M.|last2=Anderson|first2=C.A.|last3=Gentile|first3=D.A.|title=Effects of prosocial, neutral, and violent video games on children's helpful and hurtful behaviors|journal=Aggressive Behavior|date=2012|volume=38|issue=4|pages=281–287|doi=10.1002/ab.21428|pmid=25363697</ref> They were first assessed for aggression in order to avoid confounding.  Afterwards, they completed a puzzle task with a partner and then assigned tangrams to a fictitious person in another room.  The participants were told that the person in the other room, who they did not know was not actually real, had an opportunity to win a prize.  The children were told they were not eligible for the gift card.  The measure for helpful or hurtful behavior was based on how many easy or difficult tangrams they assigned to the fictitious person.  Results indicated that playing prosocial games significantly more helpful behaviors in children than those who played violent video games.  Conversely, playing violent video games had significantly more hurtful behaviors in children than the children who played prosocial games.  Deviations from the expected pattern were also non-significant.  The short-term effects observed after only thirty minutes of playing are substantial enough to consider the possibility that the longer amount of time a child plays a video game, the more effect it will have on their behavior.  The researchers concluded that playing prosocial games affects a child's social cognition, because it changes their attitudes and affect.   It is also important to note that outside the confines of a study, playing a video game may affect how a child acts, but it is not the only factor present that can affect this.

A study conducted in June 2014 at the University of Buffalo concluded that violent behavior in a virtual environment could lead to players' increased sensitivity of the moral codes that they violated, due to immoral behavior in video games eliciting guilt in players.<ref>Cite journal|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2013.0658|title=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=17|issue=8|pages=499–504|publisher=Online.liebertpub.com|accessdate=17 February 2015|doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0658|year=2014|last1=Grizzard|first1=Matthew|last2=Tamborini|first2=Ron|last3=Lewis|first3=Robert J.|last4=Wang|first4=Lu|last5=Prabhu|first5=Sujay</ref>

Studies have shown that video games, whether they are designed to be therapeutic or not, can be used to lower anxiety levels of those who suffer from chronic anxiety issues.<ref>cite journal|last1=Hsieh|first1=Ru-Lan|title=The Impact of Short Term Video Games on Performance among Children with Developmental Delays: A Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2016|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e0149714|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149714|accessdate=30 March 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0149714|pmid=26983099|pmc=4794225|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1149714H</ref> Furthermore, a study done on children with mental disorders showed specifically designed therapeutic games, that provide a "lifelike alternate reality", can help treat problems such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and ADHD.<ref>•	Concepcion, H., (2017).
