''UKChartsPlus'' is an independent weekly newsletter about the UK music charts. It was first published in September 2001 as ''ChartsPlus'' in order to authoritatively record the official music chart information in the United Kingdom, as compiled by the Official Charts Company. Its publication began after Hit Music ceased publication in May 2001. The newsletter was established to be totally independent of ''Music Week'', licensing the chart data directly from Official Charts Company and other chart providers.

History
Image:ChartsPlus newsletter logo.png|right|thumb|Old ''ChartsPlus logo'' (2001-2010)
Initially it covered:
* The UK Singles Chart up to number 200
* The UK Albums Chart up to number 200
* The Compilation Album Chart up to number 50
It also included a ''New Entries Spotlight'' on all new top 200 singles, and a ''Year to Date'' collection of all the current year's Top 200 albums and singles.

Since then, it has expanded to include the British Phonographic Industry|BPI silver, gold or platinum sales awards, predictions of the success of forthcoming releases, Budget Albums Top 50, Airplay Top 100, and UK Singles Downloads Chart|Downloads Top 40. The Welsh Singles and Albums Top 75s and the Scottish Singles and Albums Top 75s are published in reference to the main UK Top 200 listings. It also published genre specific charts, for UK Indie Chart|Indie, UK Dance Chart|Dance, UK Rock Chart|Rock and UK R&B Chart|R&B.

Some of these charts are exclusive to ''ChartsPlus'' and it is the only place where the UK Singles Chart and UK Albums Chart positions below 75 are published, as is the case for the Compilation Album Chart for positions below 40.

In October 2008, publisher ''Musiqware Ltd.'' (formerly ''IQware Ltd.'') stopped production of ''ChartsPlus'': the last issue published was number 371 (4 October 2008). In December 2008, ''ChartsPlus'' was relaunched by new publisher ''UKChartsPlus'', the first issue under new control was number 383 (27 December 2008). Issues 372-382 were issued retrospectively between January and March 2009.
