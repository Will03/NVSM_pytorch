libdvdcss (or libdvdcss2 in some repositories) is a Free software|free and  open-source software|open-source software library for accessing and unscrambling DVDs encrypted with the Content Scramble System (CSS). libdvdcss is part of the VideoLAN project and is used by VLC media player and other DVD player software packages, such as Ogle DVD Player|Ogle, xine-based players, and MPlayer.citation needed|date=January 2016

Comparison with DeCSS
libdvdcss is not to be confused with DeCSS. Whereas DeCSS uses a cracked DVD player key to perform authentication, libdvdcss uses a generated list of possible player keys. If none of them works (for instance, when the DVD drive enforces region coding), libdvdcss then performs a brute-force attack, ignoring the DVD's region code (if any). The legal status of libdvdcss is controversial<ref>[https://wiki.videolan.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions/#Is_libdvdcss_legal.3F VLC FAQ]</ref> but there has been - unlike DeCSS - no known legal challenge to it as of May 2018.

Distribution
Many GNU/Linux distributions do not contain libdvdcss (for example, Debian, Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu, Fedora (operating system)|Fedora and openSUSE) due to fears of running afoul of Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA-style laws, but they often provide the tools to let the user install it themselves. For example, it used to be available in Ubuntu through Medibuntu, which is no longer available.<ref>Many Debian derivatives provide a script in /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh</ref>

Distributions which come pre-installed with libdvdcss include BackTrack, CrunchBang Linux, LinuxMCE, Linux Mint, PCLinuxOS, Puppy Linux|Puppy Linux 4.2.1, Slax, Super OS, Pardus (operating system)|Pardus, and XBMC Live.citation needed|date=January 2016

Usage
Libdvdcss alone is only a Software library|library and cannot play DVDs. DVD player applications, such as VLC media player, use this library to decode DVDs. Libdvdcss is optional in many open-source DVD players, but without it, only non-encrypted discs will play.citation needed|date=January 2016

Using HandBrake for DVD ripping on macOS requires that one compile and install libdvdcss.<ref>http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Development/Libraries/libdvdcss.shtml LibDVDcss compiled and install instructions for Mac OS X</ref>citation needed|date=February 2016
