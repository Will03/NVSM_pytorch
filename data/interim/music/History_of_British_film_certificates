This article chronicles the history of British film certificates.

Overview
The UK's film ratings are decided by the British Board of Film Classification and have been since 1912.<ref name="About">cite web |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/about/|title=About the BBFC|publisher=BBFC|accessdate=2008-01-29</ref> Previously, there were no agreed rating standards, and local councils imposed their ownsndoften differingsndconditions or restrictions. For cinema releases, the BBFC has no legal power (technically, films do not even have to be submitted for classification), as it falls to councils to decide who should be admitted to a certain film, but they generally apply the BBFC's certificates, effectively making them legally binding. In exceptional cases, councils may impose their own conditions, either raising or lowering the minimum entry age from the certificate, banning a certified film outright, or setting their own minimum entry age for films that have never been submitted for BBFC certification, or which have been refused a certificate by the Board.
 
Prior to 1985, there were no legally binding ratings on video releases. The Video Recordings Act 1984 introduced new legal powers to certify video releases independently from any existing cinema certificate, with the BBFC being required to rate every new video release (except those exempted from classification) to determine the minimum age of people to whom the recording can be supplied, whether by sale or rental.<ref name="VRAct">cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1810866|title=Video Recordings Act 1984 (c. 39)|accessdate=2008-01-29</ref> In August 2009 it was discovered that the Video Recordings Act 1984 never had legal effect, due to a technical error when the terms of the act were not communicated to the European Commission.<ref>cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/aug/26/video-recordings-act |title=Video Recordings Act was a blank tape|accessdate=August 26, 2009|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | date=2009-08-26 | first=Julian | last=Petley</ref> The relevant provisions were re-enacted by Parliament as the Video Recordings Act 2010.

In Ireland, following the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922 (now the Republic of Ireland), the Irish Film Censor's Office was created in 1923 in place of the BBFC. This was renamed the Irish Film Classification Office in 2008.

For the first time, a compulsory certificate, X, was introduced allowing only those aged 16 and older to enter. This replaced the H certificate.<ref name="History1950">cite web |url=http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/student_guide_history1950s.asp|title=SBBFC: History - 1950s|publisher=BBFC|accessdate=2008-02-07</ref>

On 1 July 1970 the A certificate was split into two: the A certificate now allowed those aged five and older to be admitted, but warned parents that they may not wish children under 14 to watch the film, while the new AA allowed only those aged 14 or over to be admitted.<ref name="History1970">cite web |url=http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/student_guide_history1970s.asp|title=SBBFC: History - 1970s|publisher=BBFC|accessdate=2008-02-07</ref> As there was now a mandatory certificate at 14, the X certificate was modified to raise its age from 16 to 18. The classification symbols were given a more modern look, replacing the ageing logos that had served the BBFC for over 60 years.

On 1 November 1982 the ratings system was completely overhauled with only the U certificate remaining unchanged (though its description was slightly modified). The A certificate was replaced by PG, which was now completely advisory. The age of AA was raised a year and the certificate was renamed 15. The X certificate was unchanged but renamed 18 due to the X rating|lewd reputation that the letter X had acquired. A new R18 certificate was introduced for sexually explicit films. In order to show R18 films, cinemas must be licensed members-only clubs (previously, a loophole allowed these clubs to show such films unrated).<ref name="History1980">cite web |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/education-resources/student-guide/bbfc-history/1980s|title=SBBFC: History - 1980s|publisher=BBFC|accessdate=2015-03-02</ref>

The Video Recordings Act 1984 gave the BBFC the legal responsibility to rate all videos. The current certificates were all used and were also modified and coloured. A new Uc certificate was introduced for videos only to indicate a recording that is especially suitable for young children to watch on their own.<ref name="History1980" /> Those under the age of a certificate could not buy or rent a video with that certificate. Shops wishing to sell or rent R18 videos had to apply for a licence. Video releases in this period often featured unofficial logos with a plain background.

=1989&ndash;2002=
Due to the large gap between PG and 15 and industry pressure regarding ''Batman (1989 film)|Batman'', a 12 certificate was introduced on 1 August 1989. However, it was for cinema use only and did not cover videos. From this point on video releases featured the official BBFC logos. The 12 certificate was eventually introduced for videos on 1 July 1994.<ref name="History1980" /> As the 12 certificate did not apply to video releases before July 1994, several films which have been issued a 12 classification for cinema release, a decision had to be made regarding which rating was suitable for a video release and if a 15 certificate was deemed too high a rating for a particular film, a PG certificate was given with possible cuts to fit the rating. Films which received the 12 classification for cinema, and 15 classification for video include ''Uncle Buck'',<ref>cite web| url=http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/uncle-buck-1989| title=Uncle Buck (1989)| publisher=BBFC| date=| accessdate=20 March 2017</ref> which later passed with 12 for video on re-submission, and ''Nuns on the Run'',<ref>cite web| url=http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/nuns-run-1990| title=Nuns on the Run (1990)| publisher=BBFC| date=| accessdate=20 March 2017</ref> which currently remains 15, with re-submission.  All of the symbols were also graphically edited.

The cinema 12 certificate was modified and renamed 12A. Those under 12 could now be admitted to 12A films, provided that they were accompanied by an adult aged at least 18 years old, although the BBFC recommends that 12A films are generally unsuitable for children under 12 years old. Contrary to popular belief, the certificate was not introduced for the film ''Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man'', the first film to receive it was actually ''The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity''. However, ''Spider-Man'' and other films still on general release at the time were reclassified as 12A. Introduction of the 12A followed two years of consultation and a trial period in Norwich, during which time the certificate was known as PG-12 (see below).<ref name="Spider-Man">cite web|url=http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/case_study_spiderman.asp |title=SBBFC: Spider-Man Case Study |publisher=BBFC |accessdate=2008-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222123329/http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/case_study_spiderman.asp |archivedate=December 22, 2007 </ref> The video 12 certificate remained unchanged.

In January 2003, all of the symbols were graphically modernised but retained all their main features (colour, shape, etc.). The Uc certificate was retired in 2009, and replaced with BBFCInsightdefinition needed|date=September 2018, which states where works are 'particularly suitable for pre-school children';<ref name="symbols" /> however, older DVDs may still carry the Uc certificate.<ref name="FAQ">cite web |title=About the BBFC: FAQ |publisher=British Board of Film Classification |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/about-bbfc/faqs |accessdate=15 April 2017</ref> The consumer advice for the U certificate was updated to advise parents to check the film in case of children under the age of 4 and PG in case of children under 8.

This experimental certificate was used during a short BBFC trial in Norwich from October 2001 to January 2002, in which all 12 certificate films on release were classed as PG-12. Norwich was chosen due to its relative isolation from other large towns, in order to avoid significant numbers of children travelling there to specifically take advantage of the relaxed controls. The results of the trial led to the adoption of the 12A later in 2002.<ref>cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1626618.stm | work=BBC News | title=Film censor relaxes rules for children | date=2001-10-29 | accessdate=2010-05-04</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080827160223/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/downloads/pub/Policy%20and%20Research/12A%20National%20Survey%20Research%20Findings.html BBFC report on Norwich trial] (archived page)</ref>

Between the end of the Norwich trial and the actual introduction of the 12A, a PG-12 rating was used by Tameside Council in June 2002 for ''Spider-Man'', over-ruling the BBFC's 12 certification of the film. In addition, some other councils awarded the film a PG certificate.<ref>cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2042729.stm | work=BBC News | title=Parents warned of Spider-Man violence | date=2002-06-13 | accessdate=2010-05-04</ref>
