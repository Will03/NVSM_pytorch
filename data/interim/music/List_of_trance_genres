|Eurodance#Hands_up|Hands up
|Europe; mainly in Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Finland and UK
|Hands up (also known as Euro-trance) is a hybrid of Dream trance, Progressive trance, Hard trance and Eurodance music incorporating hardstyle bass drums and trance elements. It is closely related to uplifting trance. The trance synths at times can sound like techno hoovers with trancey effects and strings backing it up. The vocals are often pitched up for the most part, but sometimes they can be heard as in normal pitch range. This is often confused as vocal trance because of its use of vocals. The lyrical content is usually primitive, containing an introduction to the song with usually no or little drums, and often includes renderings of classic Happy hardcore anthems or melodies. Also some of the middle '90s Happy Hardcore producers started to produce tracks in this style.
