''Record Collectors Are Pretentious Assholes'' is hardcore punk band Poison Idea's second Extended play|EP, released in 1984 through Fatal Erection Records. 

The back cover of the album featured a picture of Elvis Presley with the words scribed below "The King" as a response to their previous release, the Pick Your King ep which had a picture of Jesus on the front and Elvis on the back.

Louisiana Eyehategod vocalist Mike Williams (singer)|Mike Williams cited this album title as his favourite of any album in the liner notes for the 2006 Century Media reissue of Eyehategod's ''Take as Needed for Pain'' (''Take as Needed for Pain'' apparently came second). The artwork, coupled with the title, is a joke at the expense of guitarist "Pig Champion", as it is a picture of his extensive Gramophone record|record collection.

Hardcore band Cold World released an EP called Pretentious Assholes in parody of this EP, featuring similar artwork with pictures of "collectible" versions of Poison Idea records.
