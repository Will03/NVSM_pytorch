The Australian Classification Review Board is a Statute|statutory censorship and classification body overseen by the Government of Australia|Australian Government. The corporate body is responsible for reviewing classification decisions made by the Australian Classification Board concerning films, video games and publications for exhibition, sale or hire in Australia. Review decisions need to be initiated by an appeal from a previous applicant, most commonly referred to as "aggrieved party", or a Federal or State Attorney-General.

Organizations
The Classification Review Board is a statutory body established by the [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw%5Cmanagement.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200401401?OpenDocument Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (Cth)].  This Act also provides a basis for the [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw/management.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200508203?OpenDocument National Classification Code] which guides their decision making. As the State and Territory governments retain responsibility for enforcing censorship and could withdraw from, or ignore the national classification scheme if they so wished, any changes to the national classification scheme must be agreed to by all the State and Territory Censorship Ministers (usually Attorneys-General). South Australia is the only state to maintain a separate [https://web.archive.org/web/20100705122212/http://www.agd.sa.gov.au/about_us/saclass_council.php Classification Council] which can override national classification decisions applicable within the state.

The Classification Review Board does not censor material by ordering cuts or changes. However, they are able to effectively censor media by refusing classification and making the media illegal for hire, exhibit and import to Australia.

Classification decisions
There have been various films and video games that have appealed the ratings as set by the Australian Classification board. Appeals include:

=2017=
*''Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw'' – StudioCanal successfully lowered the film's rating from R18+ to MA15+. The main reason being that the most graphic images were dimly lit and only fleetingly seen.
*''Split (2017 film)|Split'' – ''Consumers of Mental Health WA'' failed to appeal the film's M rating for an MA15+ because the content and complex mental illness theme was judged to be only moderate in impact and justified by context.
=2012=
*''Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus'' – Originally classified MA15+ for strong sci-fi violence specifically the birth scene, it was later downgraded to an M classification due to said scene being mitigated by a medical context.
=2011=
<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/InformationCentre_MediaReleases_2011MediaReleases</ref>
*''The House of the Dead: Overkill|The House of the Dead: Overkill – Extended Cut'' – Sega successfully appealed its rating for an MA15+ on the basis that the over-the-top violence mitigated the impact.
*''We Dare'' – Federal Attorney-General Brendan O'Connor (politician)|Brendan O'Connor failed to appeal the game's rating and thus stuck with its PG rating on the basis that the sexual references were only mild in impact.
*''Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat'' – Warner Bros. failed its appeal to attain an MA15+ rating due to violence being of a high degree; due to a lack of an R18+ at the time, the game was subsequently refused classification for a second time. Has since been re-rated R18+ uncut after said rating's introduction.
*''The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1'' Originally received an MA15+ classification due to the strong themes involving an intense birth scene. It was later downgraded to an M rating due to the fantasy nature of the themes.

=2010=

*''The Karate Kid (2010 film)|The Karate Kid'' – Lowered its M rating to a PG due to the consensus being that the violence was not detailed and was relatively infrequent within the narrative.
*''Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom|Salo'' – Federal Attorney-General Brendan O'Conner tried to appeal its R18+ rating. It was originally banned since 1997 but was recently re-rated by the classification board. The film was again awarded an R18+ rating due to the additional three hours of extras which give context to the film, the same reason as the classification board.

=2009=
<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoarddecisions-2009</ref>
*''Alien vs Predator'' – Appealed its RC rating and won, attaining an MA15+. The reason they deemed it as suitable for 15-year-olds is its science fiction context and how the mutilations were randomly generated and the player had no control over it.
*''Charlie Wilson's War (film)|Charlie Wilson's War'' – Bob Debus, the Minister for Home Affairs at the time, appealed the M rating of the film as he thought the nudity should have given the film a higher and restricted MA15+. He failed and the film retained the same rating of M, though with the added consumer advice of 'partial nudity'.
*''Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th (2009 remake)'' – Appealed its R18+ rating but lost due to how the violence frequently dwells on detail.
*Hydrolord the Game (board game) – Bob Debus, the Minister for Home Affairs at the time, tried to appeal the M rating of this board game to cause it to receive a restricted rating of 'Category 1 18+' due to drug references, the board found that the drug references were very discreet thus awarding it the same rating of M.
*''Julie & Julia'' – Appealed its M rating and won in which it was re-rated PG for 'Infrequent coarse language'. It won the appeal as the word "fuck" was used briefly and can easily be missed and is used in context to calm another character down.
*''Left 4 Dead 2'' – Appealed its RC rating but lost. This was due to the relentlessly graphic and detailed depictions of violence and gore throughout the game and thus could not be accommodated at the MA15+ rating. The game later received an R18+ classification.
*''The Loved Ones (film)|The Loved Ones'' – Appealed its R18+ and won, it was then re-rated MA15+. This was due to that the most violent scenes generally had a dark comedic overtone to it thus reducing the impact.
*''Stone Bros.'' – Appealed its MA15+ but failed. This was due to how, despite the film showing negative effects on drugs, there are certain scenes explicitly detailing how to actually form them.

=2008=
<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_Boarddecisions-2008</ref>
*''F.E.A.R. 2'' – Appealed its RC rating and was awarded with a MA15+. The board found that the violence was expected in its genre and the most violent events occurred without player control.
*''Open Season 2'' – Appealed its PG rating but failed as the violence was a bit too intense for younger viewers.
*''Space Chimps'' – Successfully appealed its PG rating and won its G rating as the comedic overtone lessened the impact to young children.

=2007=
<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoardDecisions-2007</ref>
*''300 (film)|300'' – Won its appeal and its R18+ was downgraded to a MA15+ due to how unrealistic the CGI effects were causing all the violence to be highly stylized.
*''30 days of night (film)|30 Days of Night'' – Won its appeal and was awarded an MA15+ rating over its previous R18+. The reason was that it took place in a clear fantasy environment and that the vampires bled black blood lessening the impact.
*''Notes on a Scandal (film)|Notes on a Scandal'' – Lost its appeal and stayed with its MA15+ rating due to how sensitive the public is to sex with a minor even with the film's implied sex scenes.
*''Sleuth (2007 film)|Sleuth'' (remake) – Successfully appealed its MA15+ rating for an M rating. The board found that the two uses of 'cunt' was, while aggressive, still infrequent.
*''Saw IV'' – Was originally rated R18+ due to the violent/sadistic content and graphic bloodshed. It was decreased to MA15+ based on the content being similar to the previous installments, which were rated MA15+. The notable scenes were the eye gouging, autopsy scene, hair scalping scene and hammer bashing scenes.
*Sea Patrol (season 1)|''Sea Patrol'' (season 1) – Lost its appeal and stayed with its M rating due to certain scenes dwelling on detail of blood.

=2006=
<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoarddecisions-2006</ref>
*''Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure'' – Federal Attorney-General Phil Ruddock  applied to appeal the MA15+ of the rating to force into the RC (banned) territory. He succeeded and banned the game as the board noted that while all the violence, coarse language and drug references may be accommodated within the MA15+ category, the theme proved to be high impact due to the glorification of graffiti.
*''Eragon (film)|Eragon'' – Lost its appeal of the M rating due to violence being too frequent to fit within the PG classification.
*''Stormbreaker (film)|Stormbreaker'' – As with ''Eragon'', lost its appeal of the M rating due to the frequency of the violence.
*''River Queen'' – Won its appeal for lowering its MA15+ rating for an M rating. This was due to the historical context of the film mitigating the impact.
*''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' – Lost its appeal due to the dark nature of the film being deemed too impactful to fit into the PG category.
*''Big Momma's House 2'' – Won  its appeal to lower its M rating into a PG rating. This was due to the overall comedic tone lessening the impact of the violence.

All appeals before 2006 were done when the review board was not owned by the Attorney-general's department but instead when it was overlooked by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC).
