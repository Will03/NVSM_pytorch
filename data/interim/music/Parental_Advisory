1996.

The Parental Advisory label (abbreviated PAL) is a warning label first introduced by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1985 and later adopted by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 2011. It is placed on audio recordings in recognition of excessive profanities or inappropriate references, with the intention of alerting parents of potentially unsuitable material for younger children. The label was first affixed on physical 33 1/3 rpm records, compact discs and Compact Cassette|cassette tapes, and it has been included on digital listings offered by online music stores to accommodate the growing popularity of the latter platform.

Recordings with the Parental Advisory label are often released alongside censored versions that reduce or eliminate the questionable material. Several retailers will distribute all varieties of the product, occasionally with an increased price for censored versions, while some sellers offer the amended pressings as their main options and choose not to distribute the explicit counterparts. However, the label has been questioned for its perceived ineffectiveness in limiting the amount of inappropriate material that young audiences are exposed to.

 Background 
File:Mary Elizabeth Gore.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Tipper Gore|Mary "Tipper" Gore, the co-founder of the Parents Music Resource Center commonly credited with beginning movements for the Parental Advisory label.

Shortly after their formation in April 1985, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) assembled a list of fifteen songs with deemed unsuitable content. Particular criticism was placed on "Darling Nikki" by Prince (musician)|Prince, after the daughter of PMRC co-founder Tipper Gore|Mary "Tipper" Gore recognized its references to masturbation. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) responded by introducing an early version of their content warning label, although the PMRC was displeased and proposed that a music rating system structured like the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system be enacted. The RIAA alternatively suggested using a warning label reading "Parental Guidance: Explicit Lyrics", and after continued conflict between the organizations, the matter was discussed on September 19 during a hearing with the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Notable musicians, Frank Zappa, Dee Snider, and John Denver each testified at this hearing with strong opposition to PMRC’s warning label system, and censorship in general. Approximately two months after the hearing, the organizations agreed on a settlement in which audio recordings were to either be affixed with a warning label reading "Explicit Lyrics: Parental Advisory" or have its lyrics attached on the backside of its packaging.<ref name="NPR">cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/10/29/130905176/you-ask-we-answer-parental-advisory---why-when-how|title=You Ask, We Answer: 'Parental Advisory' Labels — The Criteria And The History|last=Cole|first=Tom|publisher=NPR|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=July 4, 2014</ref>

In 1990, the now standard black-and-white warning label design reading "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" was introduced and was to be placed on the bottom right-hand section of a given product. The first album to bear the "black and white" Parental Advisory label was the 1990 release of ''Banned in the U.S.A.'' by the rap group 2 Live Crew.<ref>cite web|last=Schonfeld|first=Zach|url=http://www.newsweek.com/does-parental-advisory-label-still-matter-tipper-gore-375607|title=Does the Parental Advisory Label Still Matter?|work=Newsweek|publisher=IBT Media|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=December 17, 2017</ref> By May 1992, approximately 225 records had been marked with the warning.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310560,00.html|title=As Prudish as They Wanna Be|last=Browne|first=David|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc.|date=May 22, 1992|accessdate=July 5, 2014</ref> In response to later hearings in the following years, it was reworded as "Parental Advisory: Explicit Content" in 1996. The system went unchanged until 2002, when record labels affiliated with Bertelsmann Music Group began including specific areas of concern including "strong language", "violent content", or "sexual content" on compact discs alongside the generic Parental Advisory label.<ref name="MTV">cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1454956/sex-violence-cursing-explicit-lyrics-stickers-get-explicit/|title=Sex, Violence, Cursing: Explicit Lyrics Stickers Get Explicit|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|publisher=MTV News.

Physical copies of albums which have the label generally have it as a permanent part of the artwork, being printed with the rest of the cover. In some cases, the label is affixed as a sticker to the front of the case, which can be removed by putting the artwork in a different case.

Digital providers such as iTunes, Spotify, and Amazon (company)|Amazon MP3  tag tracks as 'Explicit' if they have been identified as such. This frequently includes tracks from older albums that predate the use of the label, or were released afterward but do not feature the label on physical releases.

 Impact 
Since its introduction, the effectiveness of the Parental Advisory label has frequently been called into question. Jon Wiederhorn from ''MTV News'' suggested that artists benefited from the label and noted that younger customers interested in explicit content could more easily find it with a label attached.<ref name="MTV" /> On behalf of ''Westword'', Andy Thomas said that the label was purposeless on the grounds that a young customer "would get a copy of the album sooner or later from a friend or another lethargic record store clerk" like the cashier that sold him a labeled pressing of ''La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1'' (1992) by White Zombie (band)|White Zombie in his childhood. He noted that its intended reaction in parents was varied; his lax mother was indifferent towards the warning, while the mother of his stricter companion did not allow her child to listen to the record.<ref>cite web|url=http://blogs.westword.com/backbeat/2010/03/is_parental_advisory_sticker_s.php|title=Is Parental Advisory sticker still being affixed to albums these days? If so, how effective is it? Actually, was it ever effective?|last=Thomas|first=Andy|work=Westword|publisher=Voice Media Group|date=March 10, 2010|accessdate=July 5, 2014</ref>

Danny Goldberg from Gold Village Entertainment opined that the Parental Advisory label offered minimal value other than "being a way for certain retailers like Wal-Mart to brand themselves as 'family friendly'"; he felt that children were successful in getting content they desired "even before the Internet", and believed that the label had little impact on sales figures.<ref name="NPR" /> In contrast, the RIAA maintains that "it's not a PAL Notice that kids look for, it's the music". They stated that research they had gathered revealed that "kids put limited weight on lyrics in deciding which music they like, caring more about rhythm and melody" and implied that the label is not a deciding factor for a given purchase.<ref name="Program" /> Tom Cole from NPR commented that the Parental Advisory label has become "a fact of music-buying life", which made it difficult for current consumers to understand the widespread controversy that came about from its introduction.<ref name="NPR" /> Greg Beato of ''Reason (magazine)|Reason'' observed that by the 1990s, "A hip-hop album that didn't warrant a Tipper sticker was artistically suspect."<ref>cite web |url=https://reason.com/archives/2009/07/28/as-nasty-as-they-wanna-be |title=As Nasty As They Wanna Be |first=Greg |last=Beato |date=July 28, 2009 |work=Reason (magazine)|Reason |accessdate=June 7, 2018</ref>

 Edited counterparts 
original research section|date=October 2018
It is fairly common for an album which received the Parental Advisory seal to be sold alongside an "edited" version which removes objectionable content, usually to the same level as a radio edit. However, the RIAA Uniform Guidelines say "An Edited Version need not remove all potentially objectionable content from the sound recording."<ref>Cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/toolsforparents.php?content_selector=parental_advisory |title=Parental Advisory Label (“PAL”) Program |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810173717/https://www.riaa.com/toolsforparents.php?content_selector=parental_advisory |archive-date=August 10, 2015 |dead-url=yes |access-date=August 1, 2015</ref> These albums are packaged nearly-identically to their explicit counterparts, usually with the only indicator being the lack of Parental Advisory seal, although if the artwork is explicit too, it will normally be censorship|censored (an example being ''Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow'' by Kesha where on the edited version, the body is moved lower so the buttocks are not visible). In the case of some albums such as ''Box Car Racer (album)|Box Car Racer'', a black box reading "EDITED VERSION" is placed where the Parental Advisory seal would be. This was part of new guidelines introduced on April 1, 2002, which also included a label that featured "Edited Version Also Available" next to the Parental Advisory seal.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-speech-2/arts-first-amendment-overview/rating-labeling-entertainment/|title=Rating & labeling entertainment ! Freedom Forum Institute|website=www.freedomforuminstitute.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-02</ref> Sometimes, an artist will deliberately change the title or artwork of an edited version as to reflect the censorship. For example, as well as removing the marijuana leaf, the cover of the edited version of Dr dre|Dr Dre's 1999 album ''2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001'' has a big box reading "CENSORED VERSION" while the edited version of 2 Live Crew|2 Live Crew's 1989 album ''As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' not only changed the title to ''As Clean As They Wanna Be''. but also censors the cover's nudity with a blue bar that has a disclaimer that reads "THIS ALBUM DOES NOT CONTAIN EXPLICIT LYRICS".

Most of the time, the edited version will only edit the content which is absolutely necessary, in order to be as identical to the explicit counterpart as possible. However, some edited albums, such as ''Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars'' ("Star 69"), ''Curtain Call: The Hits'' (first 2 tracks), and The Marshall Mathers LP|''The Marshall Mathers LP'' (Kim (song)|“Kim”) will have tracks removed completely, while others, such as ''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'' ("Happy Holidays, You Bastard" renamed "Happy Holidays") and ''The Slim Shady LP'' (4 tracks were renamed) will remove objectionable content from song titles. The edited version of ''Life After Death'' is notable for having so many tracks omitted that it was able to be condensed to one disc in spite of being a double album.

The edited version of an album will normally edit to the level in which the content would be considered appropriate for radio airplay. Strong language is almost always edited out (however the edited versions of ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' and ''The Slim Shady LP'' left in nearly all profanities other than "fuck", with the exception of the album's singles in which the existing radio edits were used), in addition to racial slurs (most albums will remove "nigga/nigger"). Specific drug references are also usually edited out, primarily slang terms for illegal drugs. Generally, however, some edited albums are not consistent with editing violent and sexual lyrics, as often, these lyrics are left in unedited. An example is "Tomb of the Boom" on the edited version of ''Speakerboxxx/The Love Below'', which leaves in detailed lyrics about street violence (including sound effects of gunfire and police sirens) and sexual innuendos, both of which would normally be edited out, but on the other hand, all obscenities are muted. Sometimes, edited versions of albums will have lyrics changed entirely, which was the case with the Maroon 5 album Overexposed (album)|''Overexposed'', in which the offensive song "Payphone (song)|Payphone" had lyrics extensively changed, especially in the chorus.
