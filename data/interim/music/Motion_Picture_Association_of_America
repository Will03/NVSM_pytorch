The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) is an American trade association representing the Major film studio#Current|six major film studios of Cinema of the United States|Hollywood, and streaming service giant, Netflix. Founded in 1922 as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA), its original goal was to ensure the viability of the American film industry. In addition, the MPAA established guidelines for film content which resulted in the creation of the Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code in 1930. This code, also known as the Hays Code, was replaced by a voluntary Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|film rating system in 1968, which is managed by the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA).

More recently, the MPAA has advocated for the Film|motion picture and television industry, with the goals of promoting effective copyright protection, reducing Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy, and expanding market access. It has long worked to curb copyright infringement, including recent attempts to limit the sharing of copyrighted works via peer-to-peer file-sharing networks and by streaming from pirate sites. Former United States Ambassador to France Charles Rivkin is the current chairman and CEO of the MPAA.

History

=Foundation and early history: 1922–29=

The MPAA was founded as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) in 1922 as a trade association of member motion picture companies. At its founding, MPPDA member companies produced approximately 70 to 80 percent of the films made in the United States.<ref name=NYT22a>cite news |title=Ultimatum by Hays to Purify Movies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/06/05/archives/ultimatum-by-hays-to-purify-movies-producers-and-distrihuters-join.html |work=The New York Times |date=5 June 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013</ref> Former United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General Will H. Hays was named the association's first president.<ref name=Kimono>cite book |title=The Dame in the Kimono: Hollywood, Censorship, and the Production Code |last1=Leff |first1=Leonard J. |last2=Simmons |first2=Jerold L. |year=2001 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location= |isbn=0813190118 |page= |pages= |url= </ref>

The main focus of the MPPDA in its early years was on producing a strong public relations campaign to ensure that Hollywood remained financially stable and able to attract investment from Wall Street, while simultaneously ensuring that American films had a "clean moral tone".<ref name=NYT22a /><ref name=EvenNews22>cite news |title=Hays Attacks Censors; Says Film Men O.K. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EhdLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IiENAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=2733%2C7216162 |work=The Evening News |date=26 May 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013</ref> The MPPDA also instituted a code of conduct for Hollywood's actors in an attempt to govern their behavior offscreen.  Finally, the code sought to protect American film interests abroad by encouraging film studios to avoid racist portrayals of foreigners.<ref name=Kimono /><ref name=Spokesman24>cite news |title=Czar of Movies Hits Censorship |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Np5XAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t_MDAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=5826%2C734859 |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=25 January 1924 |accessdate=1 February 2013</ref>

From the early days of the association, Hays spoke out against public Censorship in the United States#Film censorship|censorship,<ref name="Spokesman24"/><ref name=NYT22b>cite news |title=Hays Says Public Censors Will Fail |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/07/25/archives/hays-says-public-censors-will-fail-declares-american-principle-of.html |work=The New York Times |date=25 July 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013</ref> and the MPPDA worked to raise support from the general public for the film industry's efforts against such censorship.<ref name=ProvNews22>cite news |title=Will Hays, Pledging Motion Picture Industry to Clean Pictures, Asks Public to Aid War on Evil Films |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFBbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QVANAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=4100%2C1398046 |work=Providence News |date=6 July 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013</ref> Large portions of the public opposed censorship, but also decried the lack of morals in movies.<ref name=Black96/>

At the time of the MPPDA's founding, there was no national censorship, but some state and municipal laws required movies to be censored, a process usually oveseen by a local censorship board.<ref name=Black96/> Thus, in certain locations in the U.S., films were often edited to comply with local laws regarding the onscreen portrayal of violence and sexuality, among other topics. This resulted in negative publicity for the studios and decreasing numbers of theater goers, who were uninterested in films that were sometimes so severely edited that they were incoherent.<ref name=Kimono /> In 1929, more than 50 percent of American moviegoers lived in a location overseen by such a board.<ref name=Black96/>

In 1924, Hays instituted "The Formula", a loose set of guidelines for filmmakers, in an effort to get the movie industry to self-regulate the issues that the censorship boards had been created to address. "The Formula" requested that studios send synopses of films being considered to the MPPDA for review. This effort largely failed, however, as studios were under no obligation to send their scripts to Hays's office, nor to follow his recommendations.<ref name=Black96>cite book |author=Gregory D. Black |title=Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521565928 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybKqnNNR7hwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hollywood+Censored:+Morality+Codes,+Catholics,+and+the+Movies&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hIweUZuEJsHe0QG6zoHgBg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA |accessdate=15 February 2013</ref>

In 1927, Hays oversaw the creation of a code of "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" for the industry.<ref name=Black96 /> This list outlined the issues that movies could encounter in different localities. Hays also created a Studio Relations Department (SRD) with staff available to the studios for script reviews and advice regarding potential problems. Again, despite Hays' efforts, studios largely ignored the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls," and by the end of 1929, the MPPDA received only about 20 percent of Hollywood scripts prior to production,<ref name=Kimono /> and the number of regional and local censorship boards continued to increase.<ref name=Black96/>

=Production Code: 1930–34=

In 1930, the MPPDA introduced the Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code, sometimes called the "Hays Code". The Code consisted of moral guidelines regarding what was acceptable to include in films.<ref name=TeleHerald30>cite news |title=Movie Industry to Bar Obscenity and Crime Scenes, Plan |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-K9FAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Pb0MAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=3907%2C1202519 |work=The Telegraph-Herald and Times-Journal |date=2 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013</ref> Unlike the "Dont's and Be Carefuls", which the studios had ignored, the Production Code was endorsed by studio executives.<ref name=Kimono /> The Code incorporated many of the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" as specific examples of what could not be portrayed. Among other rules, the code prohibited inclusion of "scenes of passion" unless they were essential to a film's plot; "pointed profanity" in either word or action; "sex perversion"; justification or explicit coverage of adultery; sympathetic treatment of crime or criminals; dancing with "indecent" moves; and white slavery.<ref name=Calgary30>cite news |title=Producers Adopt Code of Conduct For Screen Shows |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WyRkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WHsNAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=3606%2C4315324 |work=The Calgary Daily Herald |date=1 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013</ref> Because studio executives had been involved in the decision to adopt the code, MPPDA-member studios were more willing to submit scripts for consideration. However, the growing economic impacts of the Great Depression of the early 1930s increased pressure on studios to make films that would draw the largest possible audiences, even if it meant taking their chances with local censorship boards by disobeying the Code.<ref name=Kimono />

In 1933 and 1934 the National Legion of Decency|Catholic Legion of Decency, along with a number of Protestant and women's groups, launched plans to boycott films that they deemed immoral.<ref name=Bernstein00>cite book |author=Matthew Bernstein |title=Controlling Hollywood: Censorship and Regulation in the Studio Era |year=2000 |isbn=0813527074 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEYoT857G8UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Controlling+Hollywood:+Censorship+and+Regulation+in+the+Studio+Era&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eIseUamHDaa00AHX1oH4Bg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA |accessdate=15 February 2013</ref> In order to avert boycotts which might further harm the profitability of the film industry, the MPPDA created a new department, the Production Code Administration (PCA), with Joseph Breen as its head. Unlike previous attempts at self-censorship, PCA decisions were binding—no film could be exhibited in an American theater without a stamp of approval from the PCA,<ref name=Black96 /> and any producer attempting to do so faced a fine of $25,000.<ref name=Kimono /> After ten years of unsuccessful voluntary codes and expanding local censorship boards, the studio approved and agreed to enforce the codes, and the nationwide "Production Code" was enforced starting on July 1, 1934.<ref name=Black96/>

=War years: 1935–45=

In the years that immediately followed the adoption of the Code, Breen often sent films back to Hollywood for additional edits, and in some cases, simply refused to issue PCA approval for a film to be shown.<ref name=Kimono /><ref name=LewistonTrib34>cite news |title=Pictures Purged |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-Z5fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wzEMAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=3861%2C4395343 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |date=15 July 1934 |accessdate=1 February 2013</ref> At the same time, Hays promoted the industry's new focus on wholesome films<ref name=SpokaneChron35>cite news |title=Newest Pictures Based on Classics |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=atRXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_fQDAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=2505%2C6402892 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=26 March 1935 |accessdate=1 February 2013</ref> and continued promoting American films abroad.<ref name=MilJournal36>cite news |title=Will Hays Gets Italy to Lift Film Blockage |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PHYxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_yEEAAAAIBAJ&dq=will-hays&pg=6885%2C5924504 |work=The Milwaukee Journal |date=25 November 1936 |accessdate=19 February 2013</ref>

For nearly three years, studios complied with the Code. By 1938, however, as the threat of war in Europe loomed, movie producers began to worry about the possibility of decreased profits abroad. This led to a decreased investment in following the strictures of the code, and occasional refusals to comply with PCA demands.<ref name=Kimono /> That same year, responding to trends in European films in the run-up to the war, Hays spoke out against using movies as a vehicle for propaganda.<ref name=PittPress38>cite news |title=Hays Scores Propaganda On Screens |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LE0bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=D0wEAAAAIBAJ&dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&pg=4508%2C6029095 |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=30 March 1938 |accessdate=1 February 2013</ref> In 1945, after 24 years as president, Hays stepped down from his position at the MPPDA, although he continued to act as an advisor for the Association for the next five years.<ref name="SpokesReview45">cite news |title=Eric Johnston to Rule Movies |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vipWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=o-QDAAAAIBAJ&dq=will-hays%20and%20johnston&pg=6105%2C4697631 |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=20 September 1945 |accessdate=19 February 2013</ref>

=Johnston era: 1945–63=

In 1945 the MPPDA hired Eric Johnston, four-time president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, to replace Hays.<ref name=SpokChron45>cite news |title=Johnston Named Motion Picture Czar |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7NZYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jvUDAAAAIBAJ&dq=will-hays%20and%20johnston&pg=6668%2C3421898 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=19 September 1945 |accessdate=19 February 2013</ref> During his first year as president, Johnston rebranded the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).<ref name=Kimono />

He also created the Motion Picture Export Association (MPEA) to promote American films abroad by opposing production company monopolies in other countries.<ref name=Lewis02p37>cite book |author=Jon Lewis |title=Hollywood V.

In 1956, Johnston oversaw the first major revision of the Production Code since it was created in 1930. This revision allowed the treatment of some subjects which had previously been forbidden, including abortion and the use of narcotics, so long as they were "within the limits of good taste". At the same time, the revisions added a number of new restrictions to the code, including outlawing the depiction of blasphemy and mercy killings in films.<ref name=RG56>cite news |title=Motion Picture Code Made 'More Flexible' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JRFWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cOIDAAAAIBAJ&dq=mpaa%20johnston&pg=6763%2C3434436 |work=Eugene Register Guard |date=17 December 1956 |accessdate=12 April 2013</ref>

Johnston was well-liked by studio executives, and his political connections helped him function as an effective liaison between Hollywood and Washington.<ref name=Valenti07p271>cite book |author=Jack Valenti |title=This Time, This Place |year=2007 |isbn=9780307346650 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |location=New York |page=271 </ref> In 1963, while still serving as president of the MPAA, Johnston died of a stroke.<ref name=Petersburg63>cite news |title=Eric Johnston Dies at 66 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uJtPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sVIDAAAAIBAJ&dq=eric-johnston&pg=2746%2C970120 |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=23 August 1963 |accessdate=12 April 2013</ref> For three years, the MPAA operated without a president while studio executives searched for a replacement.<ref name=MPAAHistory>cite web|url=http://mpaa.org/about/history |title=History of the MPAA |work=MPAA.org |publisher=Motion Picture Association of America |accessdate=23 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621235047/http://www.mpaa.org/about/history |archivedate=June 21, 2013 </ref>

The settlement was previously believed to be $80 million and was widely reported; however, Hotfile only paid the studios $4 million and agreed to have the $80 million figure recorded as the judgment and the website shut down.<ref>cite news|last1=Van der Sar|first1=Ernesto|title=MPAA Secretly Settled With Hotfile for $4 Million, Not $80 Million|url=https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-secretly-settled-hotfile-4-million-80-million-141224/|work=Torrentfreak|date=24 December 2014</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/sony-email-leak-has-uncovered-the-truth-behind-mpaa-and-hotfile-dispute|title=Sony email leak has uncovered the truth behind MPAA and Hotfile dispute|publisher=</ref><ref>cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141224/06321429517/sony-hack-reveals-that-mpaas-big-80-million-settlement-with-hotfile-was-lie.shtml|title=Sony Hack Reveals That MPAA's Big '$80 Million' Settlement With Hotfile Was A Lie|publisher=</ref>

In a case resolved in 2015, the MPAA and others supported the United States International Trade Commission (ITC)'s decision to consider electronic transmissions to the U.S. as "articles" so that it could prevent the importation of digital files of counterfeit goods. While the case being considered by the ITC involved dental appliances, the ITC could have also used such authority to bar the importation of pirated movies and TV shows from rogue foreign websites that traffic in infringing content.<ref>cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Eriq|title=With the MPAA Watching, ITC Says Case About Teeth Won't Bring Down the Internet|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/mpaa-watching-itc-says-case-775397|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=19 February 2015</ref>  The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals took up the matter, and ultimately ruled against the ITC.<ref>cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Ted|title=MPAA Warns Appellate Ruling Could Limit Ability to Fight Digital Piracy|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/mpaa-digital-goods-piracy-google-1201637501/|work=Variety|date=10 November 2015</ref>

In 2016, the MPAA reported Putlocker as one of the "top 5 rogue cyberlocker services" to the Office of the United States Trade Representative as a major piracy threat; the website was then blocked in the United Kingdom.<ref>cite news |last=Sandoval |first=Greg |date=31 March 2012 |title=MPAA wants more criminal cases brought against 'rogue' sites |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/mpaa-wants-more-criminal-cases-brought-against-rogue-sites/ |publisher=CNET |access-date=17 October 2016 </ref><ref>cite news |last=Prabhu |first=Vijay |date=17 October 2016 |title=Yet Another Video Streaming Service Bites The Dust, Putlocker Shuts Down |url=http://www.techworm.net/2016/10/putlocker-video-streaming-service-shuts.html |publisher=TechWorm |access-date=17 October 2016 </ref><ref>cite news |last=Bolton |first=Doug |date=26 May 2016 |title=Putlocker blocked in the UK by internet service providers after High Court order |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/putlocker-blocked-down-virgin-media-sky-internet-streaming-watch-online-videos-a7050056.html |publisher=''The Independent'' |access-date=17 October 2016 </ref>

Criticism and controversies
=Publicity campaigns=
The MPAA has also produced publicity campaigns to discourage piracy. The ''Who Makes Movies?'' advertising campaign in 2003 highlighted workers in the movie industry describing how piracy affected them. The video spots ran as trailers before movies, and as television advertisements.<ref name=Boliek03>cite news |title=H'wood steps up antipiracy fight |author=Brooks Boliek |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4BG8-SXP0-01V4-X35T&csi=12015&oc=00240&perma=true |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=23 July 2003 |accessdate=5 March 2013</ref> In 2004, the MPAA began using the slogan "You can click, but you can't hide". This slogan appeared in messages that replaced file-sharing websites after they had been shut down through MPAA legal action.<ref name=BBC05>cite news |title=Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4256449.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2013</ref> It also appeared in posters and videos distributed to video stores by the MPAA.<ref name=Hernandez04>cite news |title=MPAA Files Piracy Suits |author=Greg Hernandez |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4DTP-V1K0-TWDH-T3C9&csi=157105&oc=00240&perma=true |work=The Daily News of Los Angeles |date=17 November 2004 |accessdate=5 March 2013</ref> Also in 2004, the MPAA partnered with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore to release You Wouldn't Steal a Car|a trailer shown before films in theaters equating piracy with theft.<ref name=IPOS04>cite web|url=http://www.ipos.gov.sg/main/newsroom/media_rel/mediarelease1_270704.html |title=Be HIP at the Movies |author= |date=27 July 2004 |work=Intellectual Property Office of Singapore |accessdate=6 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924044120/http://www1.ipos.gov.sg/main/newsroom/media_rel/mediarelease1_270704.html |archivedate=September 24, 2008 </ref> The trailer was later placed at the beginning of the video on many DVDs in such a way that it could not be bypassed (not being able to skip or fast-forward), which triggered criticism and a number of parodies.<ref name=Rohrer09>cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8106805.stm |title=Getting inside a downloader's head |author=Finlo Rohrer |date=18 June 2009 |work=BBC |accessdate=6 March 2013</ref>

In 2005, the MPAA commissioned a study to examine the effects of file sharing on movie industry profitability. The study concluded that the industry lost $6.1 billion per year to piracy, and that up to 44 percent of domestic losses were due to file sharing by college students. In 2008, the MPAA revised the percentage of loss due to college students down to 15 percent, citing human error in the initial calculations of this figure. Beyond the percentage of the loss that was attributable to college students, however, no other errors were found in the study.<ref name=Pope08>cite news|title=MPAA admits mistake on downloading study |author=Justin Pope |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/98009/page/1 |work=Newsweek |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207045516/http://www.newsweek.com/id/98009/page/1 |archivedate=February 7, 2008 </ref>

In 2015, theaters began airing the MPAA's "I Make Movies" series, an ad campaign intended to combat piracy by highlighting the stories of behind-the-scenes employees in the film and television industry.<ref>cite news|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title=MPAA to Run 'I Make Movies' Ads at AMC Theaters, Local Cinema Chains|url=https://www.thewrap.com/mpaa-to-run-i-make-movies-ads-at-amc-theaters-local-cinema-chains/|work=The Wrap|date=25 June 2015</ref>  The series pointed audiences to the MPAA's "WhereToWatch" website (later dubbed "The Credits")<ref>cite web|url=https://www.thecredits.org/|website=mpaa.org|title=The Credits|accessdate=16 February 2018</ref> which provides attention to the behind-the-scenes creativity involved in making movies.

=Accusations of copyright infringement=
The MPAA itself has been accused of copyright infringement on multiple occasions. In 2007, the creator of a Blog software|blogging platform called Forest Blog accused the MPAA of violating the license for the platform, which required that users link back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA had used the platform for its own blog, but without linking back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA subsequently took the blog offline, and explained that the software had been used on a test basis and the blog had never been publicized.<ref>cite news|title=MPAA: We Were Only Testing Forest Blog|url=https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-we-were-only-testing-forest-blog|work=Torrentfreak|date=28 February 2007</ref><ref name=Thomas07>cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2007/02/19/MPAA_violates_software_license/ |title=MPAA violates software license |author=Brett Thomas |date=19 February 2007 |work=bit-tech.net |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110183631/http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2007/02/19/MPAA_violates_software_license/ |archivedate=November 10, 2013 </ref>

Also in 2007, the MPAA released a software toolkit for universities to help identify cases of file sharing on campus. The software used parts of the Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu Linux distribution, released under the GNU General Public License|General Public License, which stipulates that the source code of any projects using the distribution be made available to third parties. The source code for the MPAA's toolkit, however, was not made available. When the MPAA was made aware of the violation, the software toolkit was removed from their website.<ref name=Paul07>cite news |title=MPAA's University Toolkit hit with DMCA takedown notice after GPL violation |author=Ryan Paul |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/12/mpaas-university-toolkit-hit-with-dmca-takedown-notice-after-gpl-violation/ |work=Ars Technica |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=5 March 2013</ref>

In 2006, the MPAA admitted having made illegal copies of ''This Film Is Not Yet Rated'' (a documentary exploring the MPAA itself and the history of its MPAA film rating system|rating system)<ref name=LATimes>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060130093854/http://www.latimes.com/business/custom/cotown/cl-et-mpaa24jan24,0,2188275.story MPAA finds itself accused of piracy], by John Horn; at the ''Los Angeles Times'' (via archive.org); published January 24, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014</ref> — an act which ''Ars Technica'' explicitly described as hypocrisy<ref name=ArsTech>[https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/01/6036-2/ MPAA admits to unauthorized movie copying], by Eric Bangeman, at ''Ars Technica''; published January 24, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014</ref> and which Roger Ebert called "rich irony".<ref name=Ebert>[http://www.rogerebert.com/festivals-and-awards/sundance-7-film-ratings-exposed Sundance #7: Film ratings exposed!], by Roger Ebert; at RogerEbert.com; published January 26, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014</ref> The MPAA subsequently claimed that it had the legal right to copy the film despite this being counter to the filmmaker's explicit request, because the documentary's exploration of the MPAA's ratings board was potentially a violation of the board members' privacy.<ref name=LATimes/>
