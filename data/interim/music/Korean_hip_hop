B-boying, also known as break dancing, was introduced to Korea in the 1980s by dance clubs in the Itaewon neighborhood of Seoul, which were frequented by U.S. military personnel and other foreigners.<ref>Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gftM5SjLwV8C|title=Pop Goes Korea: Behind the Revolution in Movies, Music, and Internet Culture|last=Russell|first=Mark James|date=2012-10-20|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|isbn=9781611725421|language=en</ref> But it is wasn't until 2001 that Korean b-boys received international recognition, when the dance crew Visual Shock won "best show" and fourth place at Battle of the Year, the biggest b-boy competition in the world.

In 2007, the Korea Tourism Organization|Korean Tourism Organization founded an international b-boying competition called R-16 Korea.
