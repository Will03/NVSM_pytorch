A motion picture content rating system is designated to Content rating|classify films with regard to suitability for audiences in terms of issues such as sex, violence, substance abuse, profanity, impudence or other types of mature content. A particular issued rating can be called a certification, classification, certificate or rating. Ratings typically carry age recommendations in an advisory or restrictive capacity, and are often given in lieu of censorship. In some jurisdictions the legal obligation of administering the rating may be imposed on movie theaters.

In countries such as Australia and Singapore, an official government body decides on ratings; in other countries, such as the United States, it is done by industry committees with little if any official government status. In most countries, however, films that are considered morally offensive have been censored, restricted, or banned. Even if the film rating system has no legal consequences, and a film has not explicitly been restricted or banned, there are usually laws forbidding certain films, or forbidding minors to view them.

The influence of specific factors in deciding a rating varies from country to country. In countries such as the United States, films with strong sexual content tend to be restricted to older viewers, though those same films are very often considered suitable for all ages in countries such as France and Germany. In contrast, films with violent content which would be rated leniently in the United States and Australia are often subject to high ratings and sometimes even censorship in countries such as Germany and Finland.

Other factors may or may not influence the classification process, such as being set within a non-fictional historical context, whether the film glorifies violence or drug use, whether said violence or drug use is carried out by the protagonist, with whom the viewer should empathize, or by the antagonist. In Germany, for example, films depicting explicit war violence in a real war context (such as the Second World War) are handled more leniently than films with purely fictional settings.

A film may be produced with a particular rating in mind. It may be Re-edited film|re-edited if the desired rating is not obtained, especially to avoid a higher rating than intended. A film may also be re-edited to produce an alternate version for other countries.

* Advisory categories
** General (G) – ''General''. The content is very mild in impact. The G classification is suitable for everyone.
** Parental Guidance (PG) – ''Parental guidance recommended''. The content is mild in impact. It is not recommended for viewing or playing by persons under 15 without guidance from parents or guardians.
** Mature (M) – ''Recommended for mature audiences''. The content is moderate in impact. Children under 15 may legally access this material because it is an advisory category. However, M classified films and computer games may include classifiable elements such as violence and nudity of moderate impact that are not recommended for children under 15 years.
* Restricted categories
** Mature Accompanied (MA15+) – ''Not suitable for people under 15. Under 15s must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian''. The content is strong in impact.
** Restricted (R18+) – ''Restricted to 18 years and over''. The content is high in impact. Despite this category being legally restricted, in Queensland the restriction is not applicable to persons under 2.<ref>Cite web |url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Industry/Journey/Documents/Resources/CLS%20-%20Cinema%20Managers%20Factsheet%20-%20December%2012%20update.pdf |title=CLS - Cinema Managers Factsheet - December 12 update |publisher=Australian Classification Board |location=Australia |language=English |format=PDF |publication-date=December 2012</ref>
* Adult film categories
** Restricted (X18+) – ''Restricted to 18 years and over''. This classification is a special and legally restricted category which contains only sexually explicit content. That is, material which shows actual sexual intercourse and other sexual activity between consenting adults. X18+ films are only available for sale or hire in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.
** RC – ''Refused Classification''. Banned from sale or hire in Australia and cannot be legally imported. Films are rated RC if their content is very high in impact and exceeds the guidelines.

Films intended to inform, educate or instruct or concerned with sport, religion or music are exempt from classification provided they do not contain material that would result in an "M" rating or higher if submitted for classification.<ref>cite web |title=Is it exempt? |publisher=Australian Classification Board |url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Industry/Journey/Pages/Exemptions/Step1.aspx |accessdate=10 May 2015</ref>

There are only two classifications for films publicly exhibited in Belgium issued by the Inter-Community Commission for Film Rating (lang-nl|Intergemeenschapscommissie voor de Filmkeuring; lang-fr|Commission Intercommunautaire de Contrôle des Films). Films are prohibited to minors under the age of 16 unless passed by the commission. There is no mandatory rating system for video formats but 90% of video distribution abides by the voluntary Belgium Video Federation. It is basically the same as the system for theatrical exhibition, but also provides a "12" rating.<ref name="EC (2003)">cite book |author1=Olsberg SPI |author2=KEA European Affairs |author3=KPMG |title=Empirical Study on the Practice of the Rating of Films Distributed in Cinemas Television DVD and Videocassettes in the EU and EEA Member States |date=May 2003 |publisher=European Commission |chapter=Appendix 1 Country Profiles |page=125 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/avpolicy/docs/library/studies/finalised/studpdf/rating_annex2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=28 May 2014</ref>

File:FSK Ratings Dec 2008.gif|thumb|right|The Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft (FSK) ratings.
The Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft (Voluntary Self-Regulation of the Film Industry, FSK) has a film ratings system under which films are classified. All the ratings contain the phrase "gemäß §14 JuSchG" (in accordance with §14 of the Youth Protection Law), signifying that they are legally binding for minors. Cinemas may legally exhibit films without a classification but minors are prohibited from such screenings.<ref>cite web |title=Alterseinstufungen und FSK-Kennzeichen |language=German |trans-title=Age ratings and FSK mark |publisher=Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft |location=Germany |url=http://www.spio.de/index.asp?SeitID=508&TID=72 |accessdate=25 June 2014</ref>

* Ohne Altersbeschränkung (FSK 0): no age restriction (white sign)
* Freigegeben ab 6 Jahren (FSK 6): released to ages 6 and older, nobody under this age admitted (yellow sign)
* Freigegeben ab 12 Jahren (FSK 12): released to ages 12 and older; children who are at least age 6 may be admitted with parental accompaniment (green sign)
* Freigegeben ab 16 Jahren (FSK 16): released to ages 16 and older, nobody under this age admitted (blue sign)
* Keine Jugendfreigabe (FSK 18): "''no youth admitted''", adults only. (red sign)
* Infoprogramm or Lehrprogramm: "educational programming". This rating is not issued by the FSK, but may be self-applied to films seeking to educate their audience (e.g. documentaries, instructional films, etc.). Films with this rating may be sold without any age restriction provided they do not contain any material "evidently harmful to the development of children and youths".<ref>cite web |title=Informationsblatt zum neuen Jugendschutzgesetz ab 01.04.2003 |language=German |trans-title=Information sheet about the new Youth Protection Act from 01.04.2003 |date=1 April 2003 |publisher=Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft |location=Germany |url=http://www.spio.de/media_content/555.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=25 June 2014</ref>

The FSK rating also limits the time of the day in which the movie may be aired on free-to-air TV stations to a time frame between 22:00 (FSK 16) or 23:00 (FSK 18) and 6:00. Stations are permitted to broadcast films not approved for audiences under 12 at their own discretion.<ref>cite web |title=Gültigkeit der FSK-Kennzeichen für das Fernsehen – Sendezeitschienen |language=German |trans-title=Validity of the G-mark for television – Airtime rails |publisher=Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft |location=Germany |url=http://www.spio.de/index.asp?SeitID=1295&TID=72 |accessdate=25 June 2014</ref>

In mid-April 2010, the four 18 categories were deprecated, and was simplified to just 18.

Poland
Ratings in Poland are not set by any board or advisory body. Prior to 1989 the applicable age ratings were "no age limit", "over 7", "over 12", "over 15" and "over 18" and were set by The General Committee of Cinematography. Since 1989 there is no official classification system, with age ratings being self-prescriptive and set by the distributors. In case of television, the supervisory body – Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji (KRRiT, The National Council of Radio Broadcasting and Television) can impose fines upon those responsible for improper rating of a broadcast, or lack of it.<ref>cite conference |first=Lucyna |last=Kirwil |title=Age or Content Based Film Ratings: A Solution Discussed in Poland |date=3–5 September 2003 |conference=European Conference of Film Classification |publisher=Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Fernsehen |url=http://fsf.de/data/hefte/pdf/Veranstaltungen/Archiv/2003_European_Conference/poland_abstract_ppp_.pdf |accessdate=24 April 2014</ref>

Film classification in Singapore was introduced on 1 July 1991 and comes under the jurisdiction of the Board of Film Censors (BFC), currently part of the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). There were three ratings originally: G (General), PG (Parental Guidance) and R (Restricted to 18 years and above). Prior to then films were either approved or effectively banned. Since then, there have been several alterations to the ratings over the years. In September 1991, a Restricted (Artistic) (R(A)) rating was introduced to replaced the previous R-rating so as to allow the screening of certain art-house films which would otherwise have been banned without said rating, with an increased age restriction set at 21 years of age.<ref>http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_15_2004-12-27.html</ref> The R(A) rating has since been replaced by NC16 (No Children under 16), M18 (Mature 18) and R21 (Restricted 21). A PG13 (Parental Guidance 13) rating, introduced in 2011, is the latest rating to be introduced. The G, PG and PG13 ratings are advisory while NC16, M18 and R21 carry age restrictions. Video ratings are mostly the same as the cinema ratings, except only go up to M18. Some titles, such as documentaries, children's programmes and sports programmes may be exempt from classification on video, but all titles must be classified for public theatrical exhibition.<ref>cite web |title=Regulations & Licensing: Content Standards & Classification – Film & Videos |publisher=Media Development Authority |location=Singapore |url=http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/FilmsAndVideos/Pages/default.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315080305/http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/FilmsAndVideos/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=15 March 2014</ref><ref>cite web |author=Board of Film Censors|title=Classification Guidelines |publisher=Media Development Authority |location=Singapore |url=http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/Documents/Films%20and%20Videos/Classification_Guidelines_15072011.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724013050/http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/Documents/Films%20and%20Videos/Classification_Guidelines_15072011.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2015</ref>

A motion picture rating system was proposed in the Film and Video Act of 2007, and was passed on December 20, 2007 by the Council for National Security|Thai military-appointed National Assembly of Thailand|National Legislative Assembly, replacing laws which had been in place since 1930. The draft law was met with resistance from the film industry and independent filmmakers. Activists had hoped for a less-restrictive approach; however, films are still subject to censorship, or can be banned from release altogether if the film is deemed to "undermine or disrupt social order and moral decency, or might impact national security or the pride of the nation".<ref name=Rithdee>cite news |last=Rithdee |first=Kong |title=Thailand passes controversial film act |date=20 December 2007 |work=Variety (magazine)|Variety |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/thailand-passes-controversial-film-act-1117978081 |accessdate=11 May 2014</ref>

In Turkey, movies to be shown in cinemas are rated by the Evaluation and Classification Board of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism. All films to be made commercially available must be classified, except in the case of educational films which are labeled as "for educational purposes" instead. The board also has the power to refuse classification in extreme cases (producers and distributors can submit an edited version of a movie to the board but edited versions may also be rejected if still deemed inappropriate); in this case, the movie will be banned with the exception of special artistic activities like fairs, festivals, feasts and carnivals.<ref>cite web|title=Sinema Filmlerinin Değerlendirilmesi ve Sınıflandırılmasına İlişkin Usul ve Esaslar Hakkında Yönetmelik |trans-title=Evaluation and Classification of Movies Regulation on the Procedures and Principles |date=18 February 2005 |work=Official Gazette |issue=25 731 |page=6 |publisher=Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism |location=Turkey |language=Turkish |url=http://teftis.kulturturizm.gov.tr/TR,14493/sinema-filmlerinin-degerlendirilmesi-ve-siniflandirilma-.html |accessdate=5 June 2014</ref><ref>cite web |title=Sinema Filmlerini Değerlendirme Ve Sınıflandırma İşaretlerimizi Tanıyalım |trans-title=Meet the assessment and classification Sign Cinema Films |publisher=Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism |location=Turkey |url=http://www.telifhaklari.gov.tr/belge/1-77841/sinema-filmlerini-Degerlendirme.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109085537/http://www.telifhaklari.gov.tr/belge/1-77841/sinema-filmlerini-Degerlendirme.html |archivedate=9 January 2012</ref>

The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) classifies films to be publicly exhibited in the United Kingdom, although statutory powers remain with local councils which can overrule any of the BBFC's decisions. Since 1984, the BBFC also classifies films made commercially available though a home video format. If the BBFC refuses a classification this effectively amounts to a ban (although local councils retain the legal right to overturn it in the case of cinema exhibition). The BBFC's regulatory powers do not extend to the Internet, so a film they have banned on physical media can still be made available via streaming media/video on demand. Videos designed to inform, educate or instruct or concerned with sport, religion or music are exempt from classification; exempt films may be marked as "E", but this is not an official label.<ref>cite web |title=About the BBFC |publisher=British Board of Film Classification |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/about-bbfc |accessdate=12 October 2014</ref><ref>cite web |title=FAQs |publisher=British Board of Film Classification |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/about-bbfc/faqs |accessdate=12 October 2014</ref>

The current BBFC system is:<ref>cite web |title=Guidelines |publisher=British Board of Film Classification |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/what-classification/guidelines |accessdate=11 May 2014</ref>
* Uc – Especially suitable for pre-school children.

* U (Universal) - Suitable for all. A U-rated film should be suitable for audiences aged four years and over.
* PG (Parental Guidance) - General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children. A PG-rated film should not unsettle a child aged around eight or older.
* 12A - Cinema release suitable for 12 years and over. No one younger than 12 may see a 12A-rated film in a cinema unless accompanied by an adult.
* 12 – Video release suitable for 12 years and over. Video recordings with this rating are not to be supplied to anyone below that age even if under supervision.
* 15 (British Board of Film Classification)|15 - Suitable only for 15 years and older. No-one under 15 is allowed to see a 15-rated film at the cinema or buy/rent a 15-rated video.
* 18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 - Suitable only for adults. No-one under 18 is allowed to see an 18-rated film at the cinema or buy/rent an 18-rated video. 
* R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 (Restricted 18) - Adult works for licensed premises only. The R18 category is a special and legally restricted classification primarily for explicit works of consenting sex or strong fetish material involving adults. Films may only be shown to adults in specially licensed cinemas, and video works may be supplied to adults only in licensed sex shops. R18-rated video works may not be supplied by mail order.
