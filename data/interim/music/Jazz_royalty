Jazz royalty is a term encompassing the many jazz musicians who have been termed as exceptionally musically gifted and informally granted honorific, "aristocratic" or Royal family|"royal" titles as nicknames.<ref>[https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/04/07/jazz-musicians-nicknames/ "How did jazz musicians end up with all those nicknames?", section: "Performers as Royalty"], Allen, Tim, ''Oxford Dictionaries'', April 7, 2015</ref> The practice of affixing honorific titles to the names of jazz musicians goes back to New Orleans at the start of the 20th century, before the genre was commonly known as "jazz".

History
In New York City in the 1920s, Paul Whiteman controversially began billing himself as the "King of Jazz". His popular band with many hit records arguably played more jazz-influenced popular music than jazz ''per se'', but to the dismay of many later jazz fans, Whiteman's self-conferred moniker stuck, and a film  ''The King of Jazz'' starring Whiteman and his band appeared in 1930. The "King of Jazz" title was a publicity stunt in 1923 by an instrument manufacturer that Whiteman endorsed.<ref>cite book |title=Louis Armstrong & Paul Whiteman: Two Kings of Jazz |last=Berrett |first=Joshua |isbn=978-0-300-10384-7 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2004 |page=123</ref>
