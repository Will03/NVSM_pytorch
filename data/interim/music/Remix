A remix is a piece of media which has been altered from its original state by adding, removing, and/or changing pieces of the item. A song, piece of artwork, books, video, or photograph can all be remixes. The only characteristic of a remix is that it appropriates and changes other materials to create something new.

Most commonly, remixes are a subset of audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing in music and song recordings. Songs may be remixed for a variety of reasons:
* to adapt or revise a song for radio or nightclub play
* to create a stereophonic sound|stereo or surround sound version of a song where none was previously available
* to improve the fidelity of an older song for which the original audio mastering|master has been lost or degraded
* to alter a song to suit a specific music genre or radio format
* to use some of the same materials, allowing the song to reach a different audience
* to alter a song for artistic purposes.
* to provide additional versions of a song for use as bonus tracks or for a B-side, for example, in times when a CD single might carry a total of 4 tracks
* to create a connection between a smaller artist and a more successful one, as was the case with Fatboy Slim's remix of "Brimful of Asha" by Cornershop
* to improve the first or demo mix of the song, generally to ensure a professional product.
* to provide an alternative version of a song
* to improve a song from its original state
Remixes should not be confused with edits, which usually involve shortening a final stereo master for marketing or broadcasting purposes. Another distinction should be made between a remix, which recombines audio pieces from a recording to create an altered version of a song, and a Cover version|cover: a re-recording of someone else's song like Mike D|Mike D's remix of Moby|Moby's "Natural Blues".

While audio mixing is one of the most popular and recognized forms of remixing, this is not the only media form which is remixed in numerous examples. Literature, film, technology, and social systems can all be argued as a form of remix<ref>''Everything is a Remix http://www.everythingisaremix.info/''</ref>

 Roots of the remixing of sounds 

Since the beginnings of sound recording|recorded sound in the late 19th century, technology has enabled people to rearrange the normal listening experience.  With the advent of easily editable magnetic tape in the 1940s and 1950s and the subsequent development of multitrack recording, such alterations became more common.  In those decades the experimental genre of musique concrète used tape manipulation to create sound compositions. Less artistically lofty edits produced medleys or novelty recordings of various types.

Modern remixing had its roots in the dance hall culture of late-1960s/early-1970s Jamaica. The fluid evolution of music that encompassed ska, rocksteady, reggae and Dub music|dub was embraced by local music mixers who deconstructed and rebuilt Audio track|tracks to suit the tastes of their audience. Producers and engineers like Ruddy Redwood, King Tubby and Lee "Scratch" Perry popularized stripped-down instrumental mixes (which they called "versions") of reggae tunes. At first they simply dropped the vocal Audio track|tracks, but soon more sophisticated effects were created, dropping separate instrumental tracks in and out of the mix, isolating and repeating hook (music)|hooks, and adding various effects like echo, reverberation and delay (audio effect)|delay.  The German krautrock band Neu! also used other effects on side two of their album Neu! 2 by manipulating their previously released single ''Super/Neuschnee'' multiple ways, utilizing playback at different turntable speeds or mangling by using of a cassette recorder.

From the mid-1970s, DJs in early discothèques were performing similar tricks with disco songs (using loops and tape editing|tape edits) to get dancers on the floor and keep them there. One noteworthy figure was Tom Moulton who invented the dance remix as we now know it.  Though not a DJ (a popular misconception), Moulton had begun his career by making a homemade mix tape for a Fire Island dance club in the late 1960s.  His tapes eventually became popular and he came to the attention of the music industry in New York City.  At first Moulton was simply called upon to improve the aesthetics of dance-oriented recordings before release<!-- examples? --> ("I didn't do the remix, I did the mix"—Tom Moulton).  Eventually, he moved from being a "fix it" man on pop records to specializing in remixes for the dance floor.  Along the way, he invented the Break (music)|breakdown section and the 12-inch single vinyl format. Walter Gibbons provided the dance version of the first commercial 12-inch single ("Ten Percent (song)|Ten Percent", by Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure). Contrary to popular belief, Gibbons did not mix the record. In fact his version was a re-edit of the original mix.  Moulton, Gibbons and their contemporaries (Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess, Tee Scott, and later Larry Levan and Shep Pettibone) at Salsoul Records proved to be the most influential group of remixers for the disco era.  The Salsoul catalog is seen (especially in the UK and Europe) as being the "canon" for the disco mixer's art form. Pettibone is among a very small number of remixers whose work successfully transitioned from the disco to the House era. (He is certainly the most high-profile remixer to do so.) His contemporaries included Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker and François Kevorkian.

Contemporaneously to disco in the mid-1970s, the dub and disco remix cultures met through Jamaican immigrants to the Bronx, energizing both and helping to create hip-hop music. Key figures included DJ Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash.  Cutting (alternating between duplicate copies of the same record) and scratching (manually moving the vinyl record beneath the turntable needle) became part of the culture, creating what ''Slate (magazine)|Slate'' magazine called "real-time, live-action collage."  One of the first mainstream successes of this style of remix was the 1983 track ''Rockit (song)|Rockit'' by Herbie Hancock, as remixed by Grand Mixer DXT|Grand Mixer D.ST. Malcolm McLaren and the creative team behind ZTT Records would feature the "cut up" style of hip hop on such records as "Duck Rock".

Remixing in electronic music

|title=Scott Brown - "Elysium" (1999)
|description=29 second sample from Scott Brown (DJ)|Scott Brown's "Elysium" - original.
Early pop remixes were fairly simple; in the 1980s, "extended mixes" of songs were released to clubs and commercial outlets on vinyl 12-inch singles. These typically had a duration of six to seven minutes, and often consisted of the original song with 8 or 16 bar (music)|bars of instruments inserted, often after the second chorus; some were as simplistic as two copies of the song stitched end to end.  As the cost and availability of new technologies allowed, many of the bands who were involved in their own production (such as Yellow Magic Orchestra, Depeche Mode, New Order (band)|New Order, Erasure, and Duran Duran) experimented with more intricate versions of the extended mix. Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna began her career writing music for dance clubs and used remixes extensively to propel her career; one of her early boyfriends was noted DJ John Jellybean Benitez, who created several mixes of her work.

Art of Noise took the remix styles to an extreme—creating music entirely of sampling (music)|samples.  They were among the first popular groups to truly harness the potential that had been unleashed by the synthesizer-based compositions of electronic musicians such as Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Giorgio Moroder, and Jean Michel Jarre.  Contemporaneous to Art of Noise was the seminal body of work by Yello (composed, arranged and mixed by Boris Blank (musician)|Boris Blank).  Primarily because they featured sampled and synthesized sounds, Yello and Art of Noise would produce a great deal of influential work for the next phase.  Others such as Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire and the aforementioned Jarre (whose ''Zoolook'' was an epic usage of sampling (music)|sampling and music sequencer|sequencing) were equally influential in this era.
File:Melanie Chisholm byte.jpg|thumb|left|The main single of ''I Turn to You (Melanie C song)|I Turn to You'' by Melanie C, was released as the "Hex Hector Radio Mix", for which Hex Hector won the 2001 Grammy as Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical|Remixer of the Year.
After the Second Summer of Love|rise of dance music in the late 1980s, a new form of remix was popularised, where the vocals would be kept and the instruments would be replaced, often with matching backing in the house music idiom. Kevin Saunderson was the first producer to change the art of remixing by creating his own original music, entirely replacing the earlier track, then mixing back in the artist's original lyrics to make his remix. He introduced this technique for the first time with the Wee Papa Girl Rappers song "Heat it Up", in 1988.  Another clear example of this approach is Roberta Flack's 1989 ballad "Uh-Uh Ooh-Ooh Look Out (Here It Comes)", which Chicago House great Steve "Silk" Hurley dramatically reworked into a boisterous floor-filler by stripping away all the instrumental Audio track|tracks and substituting a minimalist, sequenced "Audio track|track" to underpin her vocal delivery.  The art of the remix gradually evolved, and soon more avant-garde musicians|avant-garde artists such as Aphex Twin were creating more experimental remixes of songs (relying on the groundwork of Cabaret Voltaire and the others), which varied radically from their original sound and were not guided by pragmatic considerations such as sales or "danceability", but were created for "art's sake".

In the 1990s, with the rise of powerful home computers with audio capabilities came the Mashup (music)|mash-up, an unsolicited, unofficial (and often legally dubious) remix created by "underground remixers" who edit two or more recordings (often of wildly different songs) together. Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk is perhaps the most famous of this movement, creating albums using sounds entirely from other music and cutting it into his own.  Underground mixing is more difficult than the typical official remix, because clean copies of separated Audio track|tracks such as vocals or individual instruments are usually not available to the public. Some artists (such as Björk, Nine Inch Nails, and Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy) embraced this trend and outspokenly sanctioned fan remixing of their work; there was once a web site which hosted hundreds of unofficial remixes of Björk's songs, all made using only various officially sanctioned mixes. Other artists, such as Erasure, have included remix software in their officially released singles, enabling almost infinite permutations of remixes by users. The band have also presided over remix competitions for their releases, selecting their favourite fan-created remix to appear on later official releases.

Remixing has become prevalent in heavily synthesized electronic and experimental music circles. Many of the people who create cutting-edge music in such genres as synthpop and aggrotech are solo artists or pairs. They will often use remixers to help them with skills or equipment that they do not have. Artists such as Chicago-based Delobbo, Dallas-based LehtMoJoe, and Russian DJ Ram, who has worked with t.A.T.u., are sought out for their remixing skill and have impressive lists of contributions. It is not uncommon for industrial bands to release albums which have remixes as half of the songs. Indeed, there have been popular singles that have been expanded to an entire album of remixes by other well-known artists.<!-- examples here -->

Some industrial groups allow, and often encourage, their fans to remix their music, notably Nine Inch Nails, whose website contains a list of downloadable songs that can be remixed using Apple Inc.|Apple's GarageBand software.  Some artists have started releasing their songs in the U-MYX format, which allows buyers to mix songs and share them on the U-MYX website.

Remixing in urban music
Social media makes sharing music easier than ever. Recent technology makes remixing very achievable to do legally, and the practice has become very prevalent in the music industry.  However, it has also became very easy to do it illegally, and while remixing in the music world has always been somewhat of a problem, there have been an increase in incidents. 
	Lots of famous artists have been involved in remix clashes one way or another. In 2015, Jay Z had to go to trial over a dispute about his song “Big Pimpin’”. Osama Fahmy, a relative of the Egyptian composer Baligh Hamdi, was arguing that while Jay Z had the “economic rights” to his relative’s songs, he did not have the “moral rights” to use it how he wished. Jay Z had to go to court over whether he had incorrectly used Fahmy uncle’s composition of “Khosara Khosara”. <ref>cite web |last1=Siegemund-Broka |first1=Austin |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/big-pimpin-trial-jay-z-832532</ref>
	In 2015 the EDM artist, Deadmau5, who worked with Jay Z’s Roc Nation, tried to sue his former manager for remixing his songs without permission. The artist claims that he gave his manager the go-ahead to use his work for some remixes, but not others. Deadmau5 wanted reimbursement for the remixes his manager made after they had severed ties, because he claimed it was his “moral right” to turn these future remixing opportunities away if he had wanted to. The two parties ended up reaching an agreement in 2016 that kept the Toronto based company Play Records from making any new remixes. <ref>cite web |last1=Gardner |first1=Eriq |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/deadmau5-sues-remixes-mashups-834630</ref> <ref>cite web |last1=Slingerland |first1=Calum |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/deadmau5_reaches_settlement_with_play_records_over_unauthorized_remixes</ref> 
	50 Cent tried to sue rapper Rick Ross in October of 2018 for remixing his “In Da Club” beat. Both artists have a long history of not getting along, and 50 Cent was trying to add to their fued. However, a judge threw out the lawsuit claiming that 50 Cent did not have copyright on the beat, but rather it belonged to Shady/Aftermath Records. <ref>cite web |last1=Storace |first1=Robert |url=https://www.law.com/ctlawtribune/2018/10/04/federal-judge-tosses-rapper-50-cents-in-da-club-remix-suit-appeal-expected/?slreturn=20181115024503</ref>
Remixes have become the norm in contemporary dance music, giving one song the ability to appeal across many different musical genres or dance venues. Such remixes often include "featured" artists, adding new vocalists or musicians to the original mix. The remix is also widely used in hip hop and rap music. An R&B remix usually has the same music as the original song but has added or altered verses that are rapped or sung by the featured artists. It usually contains some if not all of the original verses of the song however, these verses may be arranged in a different order depending on how the producers decided to remix the song.

In 1988, Sinéad O'Connor's art-rock song "I Want Your (Hands On Me)" was remixed to emphasize the urban appeal of the composition (the original contains a tight, grinding bassline and a rhythm guitar not entirely unlike Chic's work).
File: MariahGMA.jpg|thumb|upright|Carey is credited for introducing R&B and hip hop into mainstream pop culture, and for popularizing rap as a featuring act through her post-1995 songs with her remix of ''Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy'' featuring Ol' Dirty Bastard.
In the early 1990s, Mariah Carey became one of the first mainstream artists who re-recorded vocals for a dancefloor version, and by 1993 most of her major dance and urban-targeted versions had been re-sung, e.g. "Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover". Some artists would contribute new or additional vocals for the different versions of their songs. These versions were not technically remixes, as entirely new productions of the material were undertaken (the songs were "re-cut", usually from the ground up).  Carey worked with producer Sean Combs|Puff Daddy to create the official remix, the Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy remix of "Fantasy".<ref name="nickson3">harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=137</ref> While Columbia allowed Carey more leniency with the music she recorded, they became hesitant when she featured Ol' Dirty Bastard in the remix for "Fantasy".<ref name="shapiro2">harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=92</ref> They feared the sudden change was completely left field for her music, and worried it would jeopardize the album's success.<ref name="shapiro2"/> Finally, the Bad Boy remix used guest raps from O.D.B and background vocals by Puff Daddy.

M.C. Lyte was asked to provide a "guest rap", and a new tradition was born in pop music.  George Michael would feature three artistically differentiated arrangements of "I Want Your Sex" in 1987, highlighting the potential of "serial productions" of a piece to find markets and expand the tastes of listeners. In 1995, after doing "California Love", which proved to be his best selling single ever, Tupac Shakur would do its remix with Dr. Dre again featured, who originally wanted it for his next album, but relented to let it be on the album ''All Eyez on Me'' instead. This also included the reappearance of Roger Troutman, also from the original, but he ended the remix with an ab lib on the outro. In 1999, the remix of Mariah Carey's song ''Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker'' contains lyrical interpolations and an instrumental sample from "Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None)" by Snoop Dogg.<ref name="MTV News 2">cite web | title=Mariah Carey Casts "Rainbow" For Next LP; Taps Missy, Da Brat For Remix |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1426929/19990813/carey_mariah.jhtml|work=MTV News|publisher=MTV|date=1999-08-13 | accessdate=2009-05-07</ref> A separate music video was filmed for the remix, shot in black and white and featuring a cameo appearance by Dogg.

Another well-known example is R. Kelly, who recorded two different versions of "Ignition (song)|Ignition" for his 2003 album ''Chocolate Factory''.  The song is unique in that it segues from the end of the original to the beginning of the remixed version (accompanied by the line "Now usually I don't do this, but uh, go ahead on, break em' off with a little preview of the remix."). In addition, the original version's beginning line "You remind me of something/I just can't think of what it is" is actually Sampling (music)|sampled from an older Kelly song, "You Remind Me of Something".  Madonna's ''I'm Breathless'' featured a remix of "Now I'm Following You" that was used to segue from the original to "Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue" so that the latter could be added to the set without jarring the listener.

Many hip-hop remixes arose either from the need for a pop/R&B singer to add more of an urban, rap edge to one of their slower songs, or from the need for a rapper to gain more pop appeal by getting an R&B singer to sing some lines here and there.  When a song by a solo artist does not take off, a remix with additional performers can give the song a second chance.

Thanks to a combination of guest raps, re-sung or altered lyrics and alternative backing tracks, some hip-hop remixes can end up being almost entirely different songs from the originals. An example is the remix of "Ain't It Funny" by Jennifer Lopez, which has little in common with the original recording apart from the title.

Slow ballads and R&B songs can be remixed by techno producers and DJs in order to give the song appeal to the Nightclub|club scene and to Mainstream Urban|urban radio.  Conversely, a more uptempo number can be mellowed to give it "quiet storm" appeal.  Frankie Knuckles saddled both markets with his Def Classic Mixes, often slowing the tempo slightly as he removed ornamental elements to soften the "attack" of a dancefloor filler.  These remixes proved hugely influential, notably Lisa Stansfield's classic single "Change" would be aired by urban radio in the Knuckles version, which had been provided as an alternative to the original mix by Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, the record's producers.

Broader context

A remix may also refer to a non-linear re-interpretation of a given work or media other than audio such as a hybridizing process combining fragments of various works.  The process of combining and re-contextualizing will often produce unique results independent of the intentions and vision of the original designer/artist.  Thus the concept of a remix can be applied to visual or video arts, and even things farther afield. Mark Z. Danielewski's disjointed novel ''House of Leaves'' has been compared by some to the remix concept.

Remix in literature
main|Cut-up technique
A remix in literature is an alternative version of a text. William Burroughs used the cut-up technique developed by Brion Gysin to remix language in the 1960s.<ref>Interviewed by ''The Paris Review'', Burroughs explained the following: "A friend, Brion Gysin, an American poet and painter, who has lived in Europe for thirty years, was, as far as I know, the first to create cut-ups. His cut-up poem, ''Minutes to Go'', was broadcast by the BBC and later published in a pamphlet. I was in Paris in the summer of 1960; this was after the publication there of ''Naked Lunch''. I became interested in the possibilities of this technique, and I began experimenting myself. Of course, when you think of it, ''The Waste Land'' was the first great cut-up collage, and Tristan Tzara had done a bit along the same lines. Dos Passos used the same idea in 'The Camera Eye' sequences in ''U.S.A. trilogy|USA''. I felt I had been working toward the same goal; thus it was a major revelation to me when I actually saw it being done." Cf. Knickerbocker, Conrad, Williams S. Burroughs, 'The Paris Review Interview with William S. Burroughs' in ''A Williams Burroughs Reader'', ed. John Calder (London: Picador, 1982), p. 263.</ref> Various textual sources (including his own) would be cut literally into pieces with scissors, rearranged on a page, and pasted to form new sentences, new ideas, new stories, and new ways of thinking about words.

"The Soft Machine" (1961) is a famous example of an early novel by Burroughs based on the cut-up technique. Remixing of literature and language is also apparent in ''Pixel Juice'' (2000) by Jeff Noon who later explained using different methods for this process with ''Cobralingus'' (2001).

Remix in art

Original research|section|date=April 2015

A remix in art often takes multiple perspectives upon the same theme. An artist takes an original work of art and adds their own take on the piece creating something completely different while still leaving traces of the original work. It is essentially a reworked abstraction of the original work while still holding remnants of the original piece while still letting the true meanings of the original piece shine through. Famous examples include ''Marilyn Diptych|The Marilyn Diptych'' by Andy Warhol (modifies colors and styles of one image), and ''The Weeping Woman'' by Pablo Picasso, (merges various angles of perspective into one view). Some of Picasso's other famous paintings also incorporate parts of his life, such as his love affairs, into his paintings.  For example, his painting ''Les Trois Danseuses'', or ''The Three Dancers'', is about a love triangle.

Other types of remixes in art are parodies. A parody in contemporary usage, is a work created to mock, comment on, or make fun at an original work, its subject, author, style, or some other target, by means of humorous, satiric or ironic imitation. They can be found all throughout art and culture from literature to animation. A famous song parody artist is ''"Weird Al" Yankovic'', and current television shows are filled with parodies such as South Park, Family Guy, and The Simpsons.

The internet has allowed for art to be remixed quite easily, as evidenced by sites like memgenerator.net (provides pictorial template upon which any words may be written by various anonymous users), and Dan Walsh's Garfieldminusgarfield.net<ref>[http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/]</ref>(removes the main character from various original strips by Garfield creator Jim Davis).

Remix in media and consumer products

In recent years the concept of the remix has been applied analogously to other Mass media|media and products. In 2001, the United Kingdom|British Channel 4 television program ''Jaaaaam'' was produced as a remix of the sketches from the comedy show ''Jam''. In 2003 The Coca-Cola Company released a new version of their soft drink Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite with tropical flavors under the name Sprite Remix.

Remix production is now often involved in media production as a form of parody. ''Scary Movie'' series is famous for its comic remix of various well-known horror movies such as Ring, Scream, and Saw. This form of remix is also used in advertisements, creating parodies of famous movies, TV series, etc. For example, McDonald's published a commercial poster that parodied the movie Dark Knight.

In 1995, Sega released ''Virtua Fighter Remix'' (バーチャファイター　リミックス/Bāchafaitā rimikkusu) as an update to, just months after of ''Virtua Fighter'' release on the Sega Saturn.

''Virtua Fighter'' had been released on the Saturn in a less-than-impressive state. Sega had attempted to make an accurate port of the Sega Model 1 arcade version, and therefore chose to use untextured models and the soundtrack from the arcade machine. However, as the Saturn was incapable of rendering as many polygons on screen as Model 1 hardware, characters looked noticeably worse. Many claim it to be even worse than the Sega 32X version, thanks to the added CD loading time.

''Virtua Fighter Remix'' was created to address many of these flaws. Models have a slightly higher polygon count (though still less than the Model 1 version); they are also texture-mapped, leading to a much more modern-looking game that could effectively compete with the PlayStation. The game also allows players to use the original flat-shaded models.

In the west, a CG Portrait Collection Disc was also included in the Saturn bundle. North American owners would get ''Virtua Fighter Remix'' for free if they registered their Saturns, while Japanese customers would later receive a SegaNet compatible version. Sega would also bring Virtua Fighter Remix to Sega Titan Video arcade hardware.<ref>cite web|url=http://segaretro.org/Virtua_Fighter_Remix|title=Virtua Fighter Remix|work=Sega Retro</ref>

Copyright implications

Because remixes may borrow heavily from an existing piece of music (possibly more than one), the issue of intellectual property becomes a concern. The most important question is whether a remixer is free to redistribute his or her work, or whether the remix falls under the category of a derivative work according to, for example, United States copyright law. Of note are open questions concerning the legality of visual works, like the art form of collage, which can be plagued with licensing issues.

There are two obvious extremes with regard to derivative works. If the song is substantively dissimilar in form (for example, it might only borrow a motif which is modified, and be completely different in all other respects), then it may not necessarily be a derivative work (depending on how heavily modified the melody and chord progressions were). On the other hand, if the remixer only changes a few things (for example, the instrument and tempo), then it is clearly a derivative work and subject to the copyrights of the original work's copyright holder.

The Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that allows the sharing and use of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools and explicitly aims for enabling a Remix culture.<ref name="remixbook"/> They created a website that allows artists to share their work with other users, giving them the ability to share, use, or build upon their work, under the Creative Commons license. The artist can limit the copyright to specific users for specific purposes, while protecting the users and the artist.<ref>cite web|title=Creative Commons|url=https://creativecommons.org/about</ref>

The exclusive rights of the copyright owner over acts such as reproduction/copying, communication, adaptation and performance – unless licensed openly – by their very nature reduce the ability to negotiate copyright material without permission.<ref>cite journal|title=Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) ss 31|pages=85–88</ref>
Remixes will inevitably encounter legal problems when the whole or a substantial part of the original material has been reproduced, copied, communicated, adapted or performed – unless a permission has been given in advance through a voluntary open content license like a Creative Commons license, there is fair dealing involved (the scope of which is extraordinarily narrow), a statutory license exists, or permission has been sought and obtained from the copyright owner. Generally, the courts consider what will amount to a substantial part by reference to its quality, as opposed to quantity and the importance the part taken bears in relation to the work as whole.<ref>Mashups, Remix, and Copyright Law</ref>

There are proposed theories of reform regarding the copyright law and remixes. Nicolas Suzor believes that copyright law should be reformed in such a manner as to allow certain reuses of copyright material without the permission of the copyright owner where those derivatives are highly transformative and do not impact upon the primary market of the copyright owner. There certainly appears to be a strong argument that non commercial derivatives, which do not compete with the market for the original material, should be afforded some defense to copyright actions.<ref>cite journal|last=Nicolas Suzor|title=Transformative Use of Copyright Material|work=LLM Thesis|publisher=Queensland University of Technology|year=2006|url=http://nic.suzor.com/publications</ref>

Stanford Law professor Lawrence Lessig believes that for the first time in history creativity by default is subject to regulation because of two architectural features. First, cultural objects or products created digitally can be easily copied, and secondly, the default copyright law requires the permission of the owner. The result is that one needs the permission of the copyright owner to engage in mashups or acts of remixing. Lessig believes that the key to mashups and remix is "education – not about framing or law – but rather what you can do with technology, and then the law will catch up".<ref>cite web|title=Mashups, Remix, and Copyright Law|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/4239/1/4239.pdf</ref> 
He believes that trade associations – like mashup guilds – that survey practices and publish reports to establish norm or reasonable behaviours in the context of the community would be useful in establishing fair use parameters. Lessig also 
believes that Creative Commons and other licences, such as the GNU General Public Licence are important mechanisms which mashup and remix artists can use to mitigate the impact of copyright law.<ref name="remixbook">cite book |last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |title=Remix|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Press</ref> Lessig laid out his ideas in a book called Remix (book)|"Remix" which is itself free to remix under a CC BY-NC Creative commons license|license.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2009/05/download-lessigs-remix-then-remix-it/ Download Lessig’s Remix, Then Remix It] on wired.com</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100425054011/http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/remix.htm remix] on Bloomsbury Academic (2008, archived)</ref>

The Fair Use agreement allows users to use copyrighted materials without asking the permission of the original creator (section 107 of the federal copyright law). Within this agreement, the copyrighted material that is borrowed must be used under specific government regulations. Material borrowed falls under fair use depending on the amount of original content used, the nature of the content, the purpose of the borrowed content, and the effect the borrowed content has on an audience. Unfortunately, there are no distinct lines between copyright infringement and abiding by fair use regulations while producing a remix.<ref>cite web|title=Fair Use|url=http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html|work=U.S. Copyright Office|publisher=U.S. Copyright Office|accessdate=13 December 2011</ref>  However, if the work that is distributed by the remixer is an entirely new and transformative work that is not for profit, copyright laws are not breachedCitation needed|date=April 2018.  The key word in such considerations is transformative, as the remix product must have been either sufficiently altered or clearly used for a sufficiently different purpose for it to be safe from copyright violation.

In 2012, Canada's Copyright Modernization Act explicitly added a new exemption which allows non-commercial remixing.<ref name="WIPO2015_4">cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2015/03/article_0006.html|title=Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma |date=June 1, 2015 |accessdate=2016-03-14 |first=Guilda |last=Rostama |publisher=WIPO|quote=''Canada is one of a few countries, if not the only one, to have introduced into its copyright law a new exception for non-commercial user-generated content. Article 29 of Canada’s Copyright Modernization Act (2012) states that there is no infringement if: (i) the use is done solely for non-commercial purpose; (ii) the original source is mentioned; (iii) the individual has reasonable ground to believe that he or she is not infringing copyright; and (iv) the remix does not have a “substantial adverse effect” on the exploitation of the existing work.''</ref>
In 2013, the US court ruling Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. acknowledged that amateur remixing might fall under fair use and copyright holders are requested to check and respect fair use before doing DMCA take down notices.<ref name="WIPO2015_3"/>

Universal Music Corp., Universal Music Publishing Inc., and Universal Music Publishing Group, Case No. 5:07-cv-03783-JF, January 24, 2013).[...] Given the emergence of today’s “remix” culture, and the legal uncertainty surrounding remixes and mash-ups, the time would appear to be ripe for policy makers to take a new look at copyright law.''</ref> acknowledged the "age of remixing" and the need for a Copyright reform movement|copyright reform.
