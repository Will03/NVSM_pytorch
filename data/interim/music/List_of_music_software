This is a list of notable software for creating, performing, learning, analyzing, researching, broadcasting and editing music. This article only includes software, not services. For streaming services such as iHeartRadio, Pandora, Prime Music, and Spotify, see Comparison of on-demand streaming music services. For storage, uploading, downloading and streaming of music via the cloud, see Comparison of online music lockers. Although this field is only 46 years old, this list does not include discontinued historic or legacy software, with the exception of #Trackers|trackers that are still supported.<ref name="Historic music software">cite web|url=http://artsites.ucsc.edu/ems/music/equipment/computers/history/history.html|title=Short History of Computer Music|website=UCSC.edu|accessdate=11 June 2015</ref><ref name="Legacy music software">cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/04/21/the-14-pieces-of-software-that-shaped-modern-music/|title=The 14 pieces of software that shaped modern music|website=FactMag.com|accessdate=11 June 2015</ref> For example, the company Ars Nova produces List of music software#Music education software|music education software, and its software program Practica Musica has remnants of the historic Palestrina software. Practica will be listed here, but not Palestrina.<ref>Walter B. Hewlett, Computing in Musicology, 1990, p. 112, Stanford Music Lab, Menlo Park, CA.
