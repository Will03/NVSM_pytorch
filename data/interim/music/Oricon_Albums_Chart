The Oricon Albums Chart is the Japanese music industry standard Album (music)|albums popularity chart issued daily, weekly, monthly and yearly by Oricon. Established on October 5, 1987, the chart rankings are based on physical albums' sales. Oricon did not include download sales up until its establishment of the Digital Albums Chart on November 19, 2016.<ref>cite web|title=ja:オリコン 新ランキング発表 アルバムDL数を集計…初回首位は宇多田ヒカル|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2081196/full/|website=Oricon Style|publisher=Oricon|accessdate=November 16, 2016|language=Japanese|date=November 16, 2016</ref>

Charts are published every Tuesday in Oricon Style and on Oricon’s official website. Every Monday, Oricon receives data from outlets, but data on merchandise sold through certain channels does not make it into the charts. For example, the debut single of News (band)|NEWS, a pop group, was released only through 7-Eleven stores, which are not covered by Oricon, and its sales were not reflected in the Oricon charts. Oricon’s rankings of record sales are therefore not completely accurate. Before data was collected electronically, the charts were compiled on the basis of faxes that were sent from record shops.Citation needed (lead)|date=December 2014
