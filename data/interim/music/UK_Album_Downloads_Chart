Image:Embrace-0904.jpg|right|thumb|In April 2006, English alternative rock band Embrace (English band)|Embrace (pictured on stage) became the first act to top the UK Album Downloads Chart, with their album ''This New Day''.
The UK Album Downloads Chart is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on behalf of the music industry. Since July 2015, the chart week runs from Friday to Thursday, with the chart date given as the following Thursday.<ref name="official">cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-downloads-chart/|title=Official Album Downloads Chart Top 100|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=14 July 2015</ref> The chart was introduced in April 2006 to coincide with the OCC's decision to include sales of album downloads in the UK Albums Chart.<ref name="DS">cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a31414/album-chart-allows-downloads-from-sunday.html|title=Album chart allows downloads from Sunday|last=West|first=Dave|date=9 April 2006|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hearst Magazines UK|accessdate=18 July 2015</ref> The first album to top the download chart was ''This New Day'' by Embrace (English band)|Embrace.<ref name="Billboard">cite news|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8hUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=embrace+this+new+day+first+album+download+chart&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjoo-K33MnKAhVIVRQKHQ4cBOIQ6AEIIDAA#v=onepage&q=embrace%20this%20new%20day%20first%20album%20download%20chart&f=false|title=''Billboard'' - 22 April 2006 - Page 8|last=Brandle|first=Lars|date=22 April 2006|work=Billboard (magazine)|Billboard|accessdate=18 January 2016</ref>

The chart is published in ''Music Week'', ''UKChartsPlus'' and on the OCC's official website, with the former featuring the Top 75 downloads and the top 100 in the latter two. The chart only uses sales of ''permanent digital downloads'', that is album-downloads on non-subscription online music stores.

History
Before the inauguration of the download chart, only sales of physical formats—such as compact disc|CD, gramophone record|vinyl and cassette tape—contributed towards an album's position on the UK Albums Chart. In 2004, in response to falling physical sales of Single (music)|singles, a UK Singles Downloads Chart|downloads-only singles chart was introduced by the Official Charts Company (OCC); the following year, downloads were implemented into the UK Singles Chart.

In the first three months of 2006, more than 825,000 albums were legally downloaded, almost half of the entire total downloaded in 2005.<ref name="DS"/> In response, a digital albums chart was launched in April 2006, alongside the OCC's decision to include downloads in the regular chart.<ref name="DS"/> On 9 April 2006, English alternative rock band Embrace (English band)|Embrace topped the first ever UK Album Downloads Chart with their fifth studio album ''This New Day'', which sold around 1,200 digital copies.<ref name="Billboard"/>

Criteria for inclusion
* The album must be more than three tracks or 20 minutes long and not be classed as a budget album. A budget album costs between £0.50 and £3.75.
* An Album Bundle without a physical component is eligible to appear in its own right in the Official Album Downloads Chart from release. Once again, this is only if all formats meet the chart rules.<ref>http://www.officialcharts.com/media/647277/official-uk-charts-album-chart-rules-march-2015.pdf</ref>
