The Center for Copyright Information (CCI) is an American organization focused on advocacy and initiatives in support of copyright law. The CCI aims to educate the public about copyright law; coordinates with copyright owners and Internet service providers (ISPs) about issues related to online copyright infringement; assists with the design, implementation, review, and promotion of an online infringement notification and mitigation system (the Copyright Alert System); collects and disseminates online infringement data; and promotes lawful means of obtaining copyrighted works.<ref name=MOU>[http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Memorandum-of-Understanding.pdf Memorandum of Understanding]; [http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CCI-MOU-First-Amendment.pdf Aug. 2011 amendment]; [http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CCI-MOU-Second-Amendment.pdf Oct. 2012 amendment].</ref> The organization was created as a partnership between industry associations, including the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, and five major American Internet service providers.

Copyright Alert System

Main|Copyright Alert System

The Copyright Alert System uses third parties to identify when copyrighted information is shared via peer-to-peer services. These third parties inform Internet service providers, which then send an alert to the relevant customer. The Copyright Alert System was launched in February 2013 by the Center for Copyright Information.<ref name=Stewart13>cite news |title=Warning System Launched for Movie, Music Pirates |first=Christopher |last=Stewart |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323699704578326402159158748 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=26 February 2013 |accessdate=1 March 2013</ref> The CCI has stated that the primary goal of the system is "to make consumers aware of activity that has occurred using their Internet accounts, educate them on how they can prevent such activity from happening again, and provide information about the growing number of ways to access digital content legally."<ref name=CCI1>cite web |url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/uncategorized/the-copyright-alert-system-moving-to-implementation/ |title=The Copyright Alert System: Moving to Implementation |author=Jill Lesser Espinel |work=www.copyrightinformation.org |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=20 February 2013</ref>
