Video nasty is a Colloquialism|colloquial term in the United Kingdom to refer to a number of films distributed on Videotape|video cassette that were criticised for their violent content by the press, social commentators and various religious organisations. The term was popularised by the Mediawatch-uk|National Viewers' and Listeners' Association (NVALA) in the UK in the early 1980s.<ref name="BBFC1">cite web |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/education-resources/education-news/video-nasties |title=Video Nasties |website=British Board of Film Classification|BBFC |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2014</ref>

These video releases were not brought before the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) due to a loophole in film classification laws that allowed videos to bypass the review process.

As a result, this produced a glut of potentially censorable video releases, which led to public debate concerning the availability of these films to children due to the unregulated nature of the market.<ref name="BBFC2">cite web |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/cannibal-holocaust |title=Cannibal Holocaust |website=British Board of Film Classification|BBFC |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2014</ref>

Following a moral campaign led by Mary Whitehouse and the NVALA, local jurisdictions began to prosecute certain video releases for obscenity. To assist local authorities in identifying obscene films, the Director of Public Prosecutions#United Kingdom|Director of Public Prosecutions released a list of 72 films the office believed to violate the Obscene Publications Act 1959 and another list of 82 titles which they felt may not achieve successful prosecutions but could nonetheless be forfeited under the lesser 'Section 3' obscenity charge. This list included films that had been acquitted of obscenity in certain jurisdictions or that had already obtained BBFC certification. The subsequent revisions to the list and confusion regarding what constituted obscene material led to Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament passing the Video Recordings Act 1984, which forced all video releases to appear before the BBFC for certification.<ref name="BBFC1"/><ref name="BBFC2"/>

The implementation of the Video Recording Act imposed a stricter code of censorship on videos than was required for movie theater|cinema release. Several major studio productions were banned on video, as they fell within the scope of legislation designed to control the distribution of video nasties. In recent years, the stricter requirements have been relaxed, as numerous films once considered video nasties have obtained certification uncut or with minimal edits. Due to a legislative mistake discovered in August 2009, the Video Recordings Act 1984 was repealed and re-enacted without change by the Video Recordings Act 2010.

 Obscenity and video 
unreferenced section|date=July 2011

At the time of the introduction of domestic video recorders in the United Kingdom during the 1970s, there was no legislation specifically designed to regulate video content, apart from the Obscene Publications Act 1959 which had been amended in 1977 to cover erotic films. Major film distributors were initially reluctant to embrace the new medium of video for fear of Copyright infringement|piracy and the video market became flooded with low-budget horror films. Whilst some of these films had been passed by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) for cinema release, others had been refused certification which effectively banned them. The Obscene Publications Act defined obscenity as that which may "tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it". This definition is of course open to wide interpretation.

If the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) felt that a certain video might be in breach of the Act, then a prosecution could be brought against the film's producers, distributors and retailers. Prosecutions had to be fought on a case-by-case basis and a backlog of prosecutions built up. However, under the terms of the Act the police were empowered to seize videos from retailers if they were of the opinion that the material was in breach of the Act. In the early 1980s, in certain police constabularies, notably Greater Manchester Police which was at that time run by devout Christian Chief constable|Chief Constable James Anderton, police raids on video hire shops increased. However the choice of titles seized appeared to be completely arbitrary, one raid famously netting a copy of the Dolly Parton musical ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' (1982) under the mistaken belief it was pornographic.

The Video Retailers Association were alarmed by the apparently random seizures and asked the DPP to provide a guideline for the industry so that stockists could be made aware of the titles which were liable to be confiscated. The DPP recognised that the current system, where the interpretation of obscenity was down to individual Chief Constables, was inconsistent and decided to publish a list that contained names of films that had already resulted in a successful prosecution or where the DPP had already filed charges against the video's distributors. This list became known as the DPP list of "video nasties".<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls051364249/|title=Video Nasties, The Complete 72 Banned Titles List with Details and Anecdotes|publisher=IMDB</ref>

The lack of regulation of the domestic video market was in sharp contrast to the regulation of material intended for public screenings. The BBFC had been established in 1912, essentially as an unintended consequence of the Cinematograph Act 1909#Legal basis of censorship|Cinematograph Act 1909, and it was their responsibility to pass films intended for the cinema for certification within the United Kingdom (though local councils were the final arbiters). As part of this process the board could recommend, or demand in the more extreme cases, that certain cuts be made to the film in order for it to gain a particular certification. Such permission was not always granted, and in the case of the release of ''The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist'' in 1973, a number of enterprising managers of cinemas where permission had been granted set about providing buses to transport cinema-goers from other localities where the film could not be seen.

 Public concern 
unreferenced section|date=July 2011

Public awareness of the availability of these videos began in early 1982, when Vipco (Video Instant Picture Company), the UK distributors of ''The Driller Killer'', a 1979 splatter film, took out full-page advertisements in a number of specialist video magazines, depicting the video's explicit cover; an action which resulted in a large number of complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Agency. A few months later Go Video, the distributors of the already-controversial 1980 Italian film ''Cannibal Holocaust'', in an effort to boost publicity and generate sales that ultimately backfired, wrote anonymously to Mary Whitehouse of the Mediawatch-uk|National Viewers' and Listeners' Association complaining about their own film. Whitehouse sparked off a public campaign and coined the term 'video nasty'. Amid the growing concern, ''The Sunday Times'' brought the issue to a wider audience in May 1982 with an article entitled "How high street horror is invading the home". Soon the ''Daily Mail'' began their own campaign against the distribution of these films. The exposure of 'nasties' to children began to be blamed for the increase in violent crime amongst youths. The growing media frenzy only served to increase the demand for such material among adolescents. At the suggestion of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, the Conservative MP Graham Bright introduced a Member of parliament's legislative motion|Private Member's Bill to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons in 1983. This was passed as the Video Recordings Act 1984 which came into effect on 1 September 1985.

 Effects of the Video Recordings Act 1984 
unreferenced section|date=July 2011

Under the 1984 Act, the British Board of Film Censors was renamed the ''British Board of Film Classification'' and became responsible for the certification of both cinema and video releases. All video releases after 1 September 1985 had to comply with the Act and be submitted for classification by the BBFC. Films released on video before that date had to be re-submitted for classification within the following three years. The increased possibility of videos falling into the hands of children required that film classification for video be a separate process from cinema classification. Films that had passed uncut for cinema release were often cut for video. The supply of unclassified videos became a criminal offence, as did supplying 15 and 18 certificate videos to under-aged people. As well as the low-budget horror films the Act was originally intended to curb, a number of high-profile films which had passed cinema certification fell foul of the Act. In particular, ''The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist'', which was made available by Warner Home Video in December 1981, was not submitted for video certification by the BBFC and was withdrawn from shelves in 1986. Similarly ''Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs'' was denied video certification and removed from video stores. Popular culture backlash against the Video Recordings Act included the May 1984 release of "Thanks for the Night|Nasty" by the Punk rock|punk-Goth rock|goth outfit The Damned (band)|The Damned, who celebrated the condemned genre with the lyrics "I fell in love with a video nasty".<ref>Cite web|url=https://genius.com/The-damned-nasty-lyrics|title=The Damned Nasty Lyrics-Damned|publisher=Genius.com</ref>

The TV show ''The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones'' included an entire episode entitled "Nasty (The Young Ones)|Nasty", in which the characters rent a Videocassette recorder|video recorder specifically to watch a "video nasty" (with the fictitious name ''Sex with the Headless Corpse of the Virgin Astronaut''), and which featured a lip synched performance of "Nasty" by The Damned. In another episode, "Bambi (The Young Ones)|Bambi", the eponymous character had apparently done a "Disney nasty" entitled ''Bambi Goes Crazy-Ape Bonkers with His Drill and Sex''.

The television programme ''Spitting Image'' parodied the video nasties with their sketch of a sickeningly nice, low-budget film entitled a video "nicie".

Neil Innes' song "My New School" (1984) contains a video nasty reference "It's got all the charm of a video nasty/I've never been anywhere so ghastly, my new school".

 Relaxation of censorship 

With the passing of the Video Recordings Act, the films on the list could be prosecuted for both obscenity and not being classified. As well as not passing any film liable to be found obscene, the BBFC imposed additional bans and cuts on films such as ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre''. Claims, since proven at best to be speculative, at worst outright media fabrication,<ref>cite book |last1=Kerekes |first1=David |last2=Slater |first2=David |title=See No Evil: Banned Films and Video Controversy |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-900486-10-1 |publisher=Critical Vision |location=Manchester</ref> relating to the Hungerford massacre and the murder of James Bulger (where the 1991 film ''Child's Play 3'' was erroneously held up as influencing the perpetrators, possibly prompting the 1992 film ''Mikey (film)|Mikey'' to be prohibited in the UK), provided an additional impetus to restrict films and as late as December 1997, the board claimed it "has never relaxed its guidelines on video violence, which remain the strictest in the world".citation needed|date=December 2014 However, the board did loosen its standards, especially at the 18 level, in response to public consultation in 2000. The departure of James Ferman from the BBFC may also have allowed some long-proscribed films to be re-appraised around this time. ''The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist'' was granted an uncut 18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 video certificate on 25 February 1999, followed by ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' in August, and several official 'nasties' were passed in the early 2000s either uncut or with cuts restricted to sexual violence or actual animals being harmed. A list of these is given below. Among modern films, many, such as the ''Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel'' and ''Saw (2004 film)|Saw'' series, contain brutal, graphic violence but have passed through uncut.

In 2008, there was another brief media frenzy over such films that had years earlier been approved for release by the BBFC, in particular ''SS Experiment Camp''.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article3257073.ece Stop this debasing film -Times Online] subscription required|date=December 2014</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/32920/Outrage-at-sick-Nazi-DVDs-for-sale |title=Outrage at Sick Nazi DVDs for Sale <nowiki>| UK | News |</nowiki> Daily Express |last=Murray |first=James |date=27 January 2008 |website=Express |accessdate=9 December 2014</ref> This coincided with an attempt by MPs Julian Brazier and Keith Vaz to pass a law allowing MPs greater powers to tighten BBFC guidelines or force an appeal of a release.<ref>cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/politics_show/7254808.stm |title=BBC News <nowiki>| Programmes | Politics Show |</nowiki> Dismember of Parliament |last=Siegert |first=Paul |date=22 February 2008 |website=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2014</ref><ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article3257530.ece MPs press for ban on SS camp ‘video nasty’]subscription required|date=December 2014</ref> The bill failed to pass.<ref>cite web |url=http://centrallobby.politicshome.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/mps-film-censorship-bid-defeated/ |title=MP's Film Censorship Bid Defeated : ePolitix.com |date=29 February 2008 |website=PoliticsHome |accessdate=9 December 2014</ref>

However, the UK Government passed a law criminalising possession of "Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|extreme pornography".

anchor|DPP|DPPlist|72 films

 DPP list 
The DPP list of 'video nasties' was first made public in June 1983. The list was modified monthly as prosecutions failed or were dropped. In total, 72 separate films appeared on the list at one time or another. 39 films were successfully prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act but some of these films have been subsequently cut and then approved for release by the BBFC. The remaining 33 were either not prosecuted or had unsuccessful prosecutions. 10 films remain banned in the UK because they have not yet been resubmitted for classification by any distributors or have been rejected for classification.

A number of films spent a short time on this list because their prosecutions failed shortly after publication or because it was decided that prosecution was not worth pursuing. Ultimately, the list became obsolete when the Video Recordings Act came into force, and since 2001, several of the films have been released uncut. In the majority of cases below where cuts were made, they were scenes of real-life animal cruelty and/or excessive violence to women, both of which are still regarded with some degree of severity by the BBFC. A large number of these movies caused additional controversy with the cover art of the original big box releases seen in the video shops of the early 1980s. Unless noted otherwise, all films that have been released have been rated 18.

The DPP list is divided into two sections: ''Section 2'' and ''Section 3''. Any title seized under Section 2 would make the dealer or distributor liable to prosecution for disseminating obscene materials. Dealers could be fined or jailed and the film itself would be declared obscene if the prosecution was successful, meaning it could not be distributed or sold in the UK until the obscenity was quashed. 39 of the Section 2 films were successfully prosecuted and remained banned. 33 of the Section 2 films had unsuccessful prosecutions and were subsequently dropped from the list and placed onto Section 3.

Section 3 titles were liable to be confiscated under a 'less obscene' charge, which allowed the police to seize a film they considered obscene and as long as the dealer cooperated, they legally admit that the articles are obscene and therefore escape any personal prosecution. The 33 films that couldn't be prosecuted under Section 2 automatically became Section 3 titles and were still seized by the police. The main difference between Section 2 and 3 is that video dealers or distributors could be personally prosecuted in court for holding the film under Section 2 but not under Section 3, where the obscenity is admitted through forfeiting the material.

= Other films =

* ''A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange'' – Often believed to have been banned by the BBFC, it was actually Stanley Kubrick himself who withdrew the film from exhibition in the UK in 1973 on police advice after receiving death threats toward himself and his family, as well as disliking reports found in the British Press that the film was responsible for copycat violence. Quoting Kubrick: "To try and fasten any responsibility on art as the cause of life seems to me to put the case the wrong way around. Art consists of reshaping life but it does not create life, nor cause life. Furthermore, to attribute powerful suggestive qualities to a film is at odds with the scientifically accepted view that, even after deep hypnosis, in a posthypnotic state, people cannot be made to do things which are at odds with their natures."<ref>Paul Duncan, ''Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films'', page 136 (Taschen GmbH, 2003) ISBN|3-8228-1592-6</ref> After Kubrick's death, the film was re-released uncut at cinemas in the UK in 2000, and thereafter on both VHS and DVD.
* ''Child's Play 3'' – The film became notorious in the United Kingdom when it was suggested it might have inspired the real-life murder of British child Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger (a suggestion rejected by officers investigating the case) and the murder of Suzanne Capper.
* ''The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist'' – Although never officially cut or banned in the UK, several attempts to release the film on video were thwarted by BBFC censor James Ferman, who cited both the age of the possessed girl (as she was under 12, the film might have had significant appeal to underaged viewers) and reports of incidents of hysteria involving young women (leading to concerns that the film might cause severe emotional problems for those who believed in demonic possession) as obstacles to a home release. Following a successful theatrical re-release in 1998 and Ferman's retirement as censor in January 1999, the film was submitted for home video release for the first time in February 1999, and was passed uncut with an '18' certificate.
* ''Last House on Dead End Street'' – Also known as ''The Fun House'', this film was the intended target when the BBFC mistakenly added ''The Funhouse'' to the list (see above).
* ''Scum (film)|Scum'' – Features the tagline "The film they tried to ban".<ref>cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079871/taglines |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713054650/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079871/taglines |archivedate=2015-07-13 |df= </ref> The original TV film was made by the BBC, but they later decided not to broadcast it owing to the violence and suicides in the film. It was quickly remade by most of the original production team and released in cinemas, and was released on VHS at the height of the Video Nasties controversy, quickly becoming associated with them in the media.
* ''Mikey (film)|Mikey'' – The film was withdrawn from release in the United Kingdom following the James Bulger murder in Liverpool in 1993. The decision was made by the BBFC which refused to issue it with a UK release certificate in 1996. It remains prohibited in the UK. <ref>Cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/mikey-1993</ref>
* ''Urotsukidōji|Urotsukidōji: Legend of the Overfiend'' – Described by some anime critics as a video nasty, this anime which contained scenes of graphic violence and tentacle erotica|tentacle rape was attacked by the British press and politicians, who feared that such animation could be used to corrupt children and that it should be banned. No ban was issued and the resulting publicity led to increased sales.<ref>cite book|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|author-link=Jonathan Clements|title=Schoolgirl Milk Crisis: Adventures in the Anime and Manga Trade|publisher=Titan Books|date=2009|location=London|pages=73|language=English|isbn=9781848560833</ref> Later releases of the anime were heavily censored, sometimes leading to the plot being confusing.<ref>Clements, p. 274</ref>
