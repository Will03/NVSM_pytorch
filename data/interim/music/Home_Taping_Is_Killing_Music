"Home Taping Is Killing Music" was the slogan of a 1980s anti-copyright infringement propaganda campaign by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), a British music industry trade group. With the rise in cassette deck|cassette recorder popularity, the BPI feared that the ability of private citizens to record music from the radio onto cassettes would cause a decline in record sales. The logo, consisting of a Jolly Roger formed from the silhouette of a Compact Cassette, also included the words "And It's Illegal".

In the 2000s, the campaign experienced a revival, as the Norwegian branch of IFPI (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry) launched a new campaign named Piracy Kills Music. The campaign has exactly the same message, same name and similar logos. The campaign won the Norwegian 2008 Gulltaggen award for "Best Internet Strategy" with much controversy.fact|date=December 2014

An early proponent of home taping was Malcolm McLaren, who was at the time managing the British New wave music|new wave band Bow Wow Wow. In 1980, the band released their cassette single "C·30 C·60 C·90 Go" on cassette that featured a blank B-side on which the buyer could record their own music. The band's record label, EMI, dropped the group shortly afterwards because the single allegedly promoted home taping.fact|date=December 2014

 Parodies

Some fanzines changed the words to ''Home taping is killing the music industry'' and added the words ''...so be sure to do your part!'' below the logo. Another example was the early 1980s counter-slogan ''Home Taping is Skill in Music'', referring to early mixtapes, a precursor to Sampling (music)|sampling and remixes.
