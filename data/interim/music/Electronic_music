Electronic music top

Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments, digital instruments and electronics|circuitry-based music technology. In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means (electroacoustic music), and that produced using electronics only.<ref name="holmes3">"The stuff of electronic music is electrically produced or modified sounds. ... two basic definitions will help put some of the historical discussion in its place: purely electronic music versus electroacoustic music" (harvnb|Holmes|2002|p=6).</ref> Electromechanical instruments include mechanical elements, such as strings, hammers, and so on, and electric elements, such as pickup (music technology)|magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar, which are typically made loud enough for performers and audiences to hear with an instrument amplifier and speaker cabinet. Pure electronic instruments do not have vibrating strings, hammers, or other sound-producing mechanisms. Devices such as the theremin, synthesizer, and computer music|computer can produce electronic sounds.<ref name="holmes1">Electroacoustic music may also use electronic effect units to change sounds from the natural world, such as the sound of waves on a beach or bird calls. All types of sounds can be used as source material for this music. Electroacoustic performers and composers use microphones, tape recorders and digital samplers to make live or recorded music. During live performances, natural sounds are modified in real time using electronic effects and audio consoles. The source of the sound can be anything from ambient noise (traffic, people talking) and nature sounds to live musicians playing conventional acoustic or electro-acoustic instruments (harvnb|Holmes|2002|p=8).</ref>

The first electronic devices for performing music were developed at the end of the 19th century, and shortly afterward Italian Futurism|futurists explored sounds that had not been considered musical. During the 1920s and 1930s, electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions for electronic instruments were made. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction, leading to the development of electroacoustic music|electroacoustic tape music in the 1940s, in Egypt and France. Musique concrète, created in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s. An important new development was the advent of computers to compose music. Algorithmic composition with computers was first demonstrated in the 1950s (although algorithmic composition per se without a computer had occurred much earlier, for example Mozart's Musikalisches Würfelspiel).

In the 1960s, live electronics were pioneered in America and Europe, Japanese electronic musical instruments began influencing the music industry, and Jamaican dub music emerged as a form of popular electronic music. In the early 1970s, the Monophonic synthesizer|monophonic Minimoog synthesizer and Japanese drum machines helped popularize synthesized electronic music.

In the 1970s, electronic music began having a significant influence on popular music, with the adoption of polyphonic synthesizers, electronic drums, drum machines, and Turntablism|turntables, through the emergence of genres such as disco, krautrock, New wave music|new wave, synth-pop, Hip hop music|hip hop and Electronic dance music|EDM. In the 1980s, electronic music became more dominant in popular music, with a greater reliance on synthesizers, and the adoption of programmable drum machines such as the Roland TR-808 and bass synthesizers such as the TB-303. In the early 1980s, Digital technology|digital technologies for synthesizers including digital synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7 were popularized, and a group of musicians and music merchants developed the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI).

Electronically produced music became prevalent in the popular domain by the 1990s, because of the advent of affordable music technology.<ref>"Electronically produced music is part of the mainstream of popular culture. Musical concepts that were once considered radical&mdash;the use of environmental sounds, ambient music, turntable music, digital sampling, computer music, the electronic modification of acoustic sounds, and music made from fragments of speech-have now been subsumed by many kinds of popular music. Record store genres including new age, rap, hip-hop, electronica, techno, jazz, and popular song all rely heavily on production values and techniques that originated with classic electronic music" (harvnb|Holmes|2002|p=1). "By the 1990s, electronic music had penetrated every corner of musical life. It extended from ethereal sound-waves played by esoteric experimenters to the thumping syncopation that accompanies every pop record" (harvnb|Lebrecht|1996|p=106).</ref> <!-- following paragraph and citation questionable: Today, the term electronic music serves to differentiate music that uses electronics as its focal point or inspiration, from music that uses electronics mainly in service of creating an intended production that may have some electronic elements in the sound but does not focus upon them.<ref name="holmes2">"Purely electronic music is created through the generation of sound waves by electrical means. This is done without the use of traditional musical instruments or of sounds found in nature, and is the domain of computers, synthesizers and other technologies" harv|Holmes|2002|loc=6.</ref> --> Contemporary electronic music includes many varieties and ranges from Experimental music|experimental art music to popular forms such as electronic dance music. Today, pop electronic music is most recognizable in its 4/4 form and more connected with the mainstream culture as opposed to its preceding forms which were specialized to niche markets.<ref>Cite journal|title = Pleasure Beats: Rhythm and the Aesthetics of Current Electronic Music|url = http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/096112102762295052|journal = Leonardo Music Journal |pages = 3–6|volume = 12|doi = 10.1162/096112102762295052|first = Ben|last = Neill</ref>

Critics of musical conventions at the time saw promise in these developments. Ferruccio Busoni encouraged the composition of microtonal music allowed for by electronic instruments. He predicted the use of machines in future music, writing the influential ''Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music''.<ref>harvnb|Busoni|1962|p=95; harvnb|Russcol|1972|pp=35&ndash;36.</ref> Futurism (music)|Futurists such as Francesco Balilla Pratella and Luigi Russolo began composing noise music|music with acoustic noise to evoke the sound of machinery.

From the late 1920s, the increased practicality of electronic instruments influenced composers such as Joseph Schillinger to adopt them. They were typically used within orchestras, and most composers wrote parts for the theremin that could otherwise be performed with string instruments.<ref name="holmes_21"/>

= Recording experiments =

Developments in early Sound recording and reproduction|recording technology paralleled that of electronic instruments. The first means of recording and reproducing audio was invented in the late 19th century with the mechanical phonograph.<ref name="holmes_34">harvnb|Holmes|4th Edition|p=34</ref> Record players became a common household item, and by the 1920s composers were using them to play short recordings in performances.<ref name="holmes_45">harvnb|Holmes|4th Edition|p=45</ref>

The introduction of Gramophone record#Electrical recording|electrical recording in 1925 was followed by increased experimentation with record players. Paul Hindemith and Ernst Toch composed several pieces in 1930 by layering recordings of instruments and vocals at adjusted speeds. Influenced by these techniques, John Cage composed ''Imaginary Landscape No. 1'' in 1939 by adjusting the speeds of recorded tones.<ref name="holmes_46">harvnb|Holmes|4th Edition|p=46</ref>

Concurrently, composers began to experiment with newly developed sound-on-film technology. Recordings could be spliced together to create sound collages, such as those by Tristan Tzara, Kurt Schwitters, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Walter Ruttmann and Dziga Vertov. Further, the technology allowed sound to be graphical sound|graphically created and modified. These techniques were used to compose soundtracks for several films in Germany and Russia, in addition to the popular ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' in the United States. Experiments with graphical sound were continued by Norman McLaren from the late 1930s.citation needed|date=December 2018

In 1944, prior to the use of magnetic tape for compositional purposes, Egyptian composer Halim El-Dabh, while still a student in Cairo, used a cumbersome Wire recording|wire recorder to record sounds of an ancient ''Zār|zaar'' ceremony. Using facilities at the Middle East Radio studios El-Dabh processed the recorded material using reverberation, echo, voltage controls, and re-recording. What resulted is believed to be the earliest tape music composition.<ref name="wire_2007">harvnb|Young|2007|p=24</ref> The resulting work was entitled ''The Expression of Zaar'' and it was presented in 1944 at an art gallery event in Cairo.

Following his work with Studio d'Essai at Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|Radiodiffusion Française (RDF), during the early 1940s, Pierre Schaeffer is credited with originating the theory and practice of musique concrète. In the late 1940s, experiments in sound based composition using shellac record players were first conducted by Schaeffer. In 1950, the techniques of musique concrete were expanded when magnetic tape machines were used to explore sound manipulation practices such as speed variation (pitch shift) and tape splicing harv|Palombini|1993|loc=14.<ref name="lebrecht1">"Musique Concrete was created in Paris in 1948 from edited collages of everyday noise" (harvnb|Lebrecht|1996|p=107).</ref>

On 5 October 1948, RDF broadcast Schaeffer's ''Etude aux chemins de fer''. This was the first "movement (music)|movement" of ''Cinq études de bruits'', and marked the beginning of studio realizations<ref>NB: To the pioneers, an electronic work did not exist until it was "realized" in a real-time performance (harvnb|Holmes|2008|p=122).</ref> and musique concrète (or acousmatic art). Schaeffer employed a disk-cutting lathe, four turntables, a four-channel mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile recording unit. Not long after this, Pierre Henry began collaborating with Schaeffer, a partnership that would have profound and lasting effects on the direction of electronic music. Another associate of Schaeffer, Edgard Varèse, began work on ''Déserts'', a work for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer's studio, and were later revised at Columbia University.

In 1950, Schaeffer gave the first public (non-broadcast) concert of musique concrète at the École Normale de Musique de Paris. "Schaeffer used a Public address system|PA system, several turntables, and mixers. The performance did not go well, as creating live montages with turntables had never been done before."<ref>harvnb|Snyder|n.d.</ref> Later that same year, Pierre Henry collaborated with Schaeffer on ''Symphonie pour un homme seul'' (1950) the first major work of musique concrete. In Paris in 1951, in what was to become an important worldwide trend, RTF established the first studio for the production of electronic music. Also in 1951, Schaeffer and Henry produced an opera, ''Orpheus'', for concrete sounds and voices.

File:Stockhausen 1991 Studio.jpg|thumb|Karlheinz Stockhausen in the Electronic Music Studio of WDR, Cologne, in 1991
Karlheinz Stockhausen worked briefly in Schaeffer's studio in 1952, and afterward for many years at the Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR Cologne's Studio for Electronic Music (WDR)|Studio for Electronic Music.

In Cologne, what would become the most famous electronic music studio in the world was officially opened at the radio studios of the NWDR in 1953, though it had been in the planning stages as early as 1950 and early compositions were made and broadcast in 1951.<ref>harvnb|Eimert|1972|p=349.</ref> The brain child of Werner Meyer-Eppler, Robert Beyer, and Herbert Eimert (who became its first director), the studio was soon joined by Karlheinz Stockhausen and Gottfried Michael Koenig. In his 1949 thesis ''Elektronische Klangerzeugung: Elektronische Musik und Synthetische Sprache'', Meyer-Eppler conceived the idea to synthesize music entirely from electronically produced signals; in this way, ''elektronische Musik'' was sharply differentiated from French ''musique concrète'', which used sounds recorded from acoustical sources.<ref>harvnb|Eimert|1958|p=2; harvnb|Ungeheuer|1992|p=117.</ref>

Many listeners have projected that strange new music which they experienced&mdash;especially in the realm of electronic music&mdash;into extraterrestrial space. Even though they are not familiar with it through human experience, they identify it with the fantastic dream world. Several have commented that my electronic music sounds "like on a different star", or "like in outer space." Many have said that when hearing this music, they have sensations as if flying at an infinitely high speed, and then again, as if immobile in an immense space. Thus, extreme words are employed to describe such experience, which are not "objectively" communicable in the sense of an object description, but rather which exist in the subjective fantasy and which are projected into the extraterrestrial space'" (harvnb|Holmes|2002|p=145).</ref>
More recently, Stockhausen turned to producing electronic music in his own studio in Kürten, his last work in the medium being ''Cosmic Pulses'' (2007).

In the United States, electronic music was being created as early as 1939, when John Cage published ''Imaginary Landscape, No. 1'', using two variable-speed turntables, frequency recordings, muted piano, and cymbal, but no electronic means of production. Cage composed five more "Imaginary Landscapes" between 1942 and 1952 (one withdrawn), mostly for percussion ensemble, though No. 4 is for twelve radios and No. 5, written in 1952, uses 42 recordings and is to be realized as a magnetic tape. According to Otto Luening, Cage also performed a ''William sic Mix'' at Donaueschingen in 1954, using eight loudspeakers, three years after his alleged collaboration.Clarify|date=October 2014<!--Three years before 1954 is 1951.

Herbert Russcol writes: "Soon he was intrigued with the new sonorities he could achieve by recording musical instruments and then superimposing them on one another."<ref name="nwclfn">harvnb|Russcol|1972|p=92.</ref> Ussachevsky said later: "I suddenly realized that the tape recorder could be treated as an instrument of sound transformation."<ref name="nwclfn" /> On Thursday, May 8, 1952, Ussachevsky presented several demonstrations of tape music/effects that he created at his Composers Forum, in the McMillin Theatre at Columbia University. These included ''Transposition, Reverberation, Experiment, Composition'', and ''Underwater Valse''. In an interview, he stated: "I presented a few examples of my discovery in a public concert in New York together with other compositions I had written for conventional instruments."<ref name="nwclfn" />
Otto Luening, who had attended this concert, remarked: "The equipment at his disposal consisted of an Ampex tape recorder . . . and a simple box-like device designed by the brilliant young engineer, Peter Mauzey, to create feedback, a form of mechanical reverberation. Other equipment was borrowed or purchased with personal funds."<ref name="urajla">harvnb|Luening|1968|p=48.</ref>

Just three months later, in August 1952, Ussachevsky traveled to Bennington, Vermont at Luening's invitation to present his experiments. There, the two collaborated on various pieces. Luening described the event: "Equipped with earphones and a flute, I began developing my first tape-recorder composition. Both of us were fluent improvisors and the medium fired our imaginations."<ref name="urajla" />
They played some early pieces informally at a party, where "a number of composers almost solemnly congratulated us saying, 'This is it' ('it' meaning the music of the future)."<ref name="urajla" />

Word quickly reached New York City. Oliver Daniel telephoned and invited the pair to "produce a group of short compositions for the October concert sponsored by the American Composers Alliance and Broadcast Music, Inc., under the direction of Leopold Stokowski at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. After some hesitation, we agreed. . . . Henry Cowell placed his home and studio in Woodstock, New York, at our disposal. With the borrowed equipment in the back of Ussachevsky's car, we left Bennington for Woodstock and stayed two weeks. . . . In late September, 1952, the travelling laboratory reached Ussachevsky's living room in New York, where we eventually completed the compositions."<ref name="urajla" />

Two months later, on October 28, Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening presented the first Tape Music concert in the United States. The concert included Luening's ''Fantasy in Space'' (1952)&mdash;"an impressionistic virtuoso piece"<ref name="urajla" /> using manipulated recordings of flute&mdash;and ''Low Speed'' (1952), an "exotic composition that took the flute far below its natural range."<ref name="urajla" /> Both pieces were created at the home of Henry Cowell in Woodstock, NY. After several concerts caused a sensation in New York City, Ussachevsky and Luening were invited onto a live broadcast of NBC's Today Show to do an interview demonstration&mdash;the first televised electroacoustic performance. Luening described the event: "I improvised some [flute] sequences for the tape recorder. Ussachevsky then and there put them through electronic transformations."<ref>harvnb|Luening|1968|p=49.</ref>

1954 saw the advent of what would now be considered authentic electric plus acoustic compositions&mdash;acoustic instrumentation augmented/accompanied by recordings of manipulated or electronically generated sound. Three major works were premiered that year: Varèse's ''Déserts'', for chamber ensemble and tape sounds, and two works by Luening and Ussachevsky: ''Rhapsodic Variations for the Louisville Symphony'' and ''A Poem in Cycles and Bells'', both for orchestra and tape. Because he had been working at Schaeffer's studio, the tape part for Varèse's work contains much more concrete sounds than electronic. "A group made up of wind instruments, percussion and piano alternates with the mutated sounds of factory noises and ship sirens and motors, coming from two loudspeakers."<ref name="qtrckp">harvnb|Kurtz|1992|pp=75&ndash;76.</ref>

At the German premiere of ''Déserts'' in Hamburg, which was conducted by Bruno Maderna, the tape controls were operated by Karlheinz Stockhausen.<ref name="qtrckp" /> The title ''Déserts'' suggested to Varèse not only "all physical deserts (of sand, sea, snow, of outer space, of empty streets), but also the deserts in the mind of man; not only those stripped aspects of nature that suggest bareness, aloofness, timelessness, but also that remote inner space no telescope can reach, where man is alone, a world of mystery and essential loneliness."<ref>harvnb|Anonymous|1972.</ref>

Main article|Iannis Xenakis|Stochastic music
An important new development was the advent of computers for the purpose of composing music, as opposed to manipulating or creating sounds. Iannis Xenakis began what is called ''musique stochastique'', or ''stochastic music'', which is a composing method that uses mathematical probability systems. Different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters. Xenakis used computers to compose pieces like ''ST/4'' for string quartet and ''ST/48'' for orchestra (both 1962),<ref>harvnb|Xenakis|1992|pp=Page needed|date=October 2012</ref> ''Morsima-Amorsima'', ''ST/10'', and ''Atrées''. He developed the computer system UPIC for translating graphical images into musical results and composed ''Mycènes Alpha'' (1978) with it.

=Mid-to-late 1950s=
File:CSIRAC.jpg|thumb|CSIRAC, Australia's first digital computer, displayed at the Melbourne Museum
In 1954, Stockhausen composed his ''Studie II|Elektronische Studie II''&mdash;the first electronic piece to be published as a score. In 1955, more experimental and electronic studios began to appear. Notable were the creation of the Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano, a studio at the NHK in Tokyo founded by Toshiro Mayuzumi, and the Philips studio at Eindhoven, the Netherlands, which moved to the University of Utrecht as the Institute of Sonology in 1960.

The score for ''Forbidden Planet'', by Louis and Bebe Barron,<ref name="norman2">"From at least Louis and Bebbe Barron's soundtrack for ''The Forbidden Planet'' onwards, electronic music—in particular synthetic timbre—has impersonated alien worlds in film" (harvnb|Norman|2004|p=32).</ref> was entirely composed using custom built electronic circuits and tape recorders in 1956.

The world's first computer to play music was CSIRAC, which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the Colonel Bogey March, of which no known recordings exist, only the accurate reconstruction.<ref>harvnb|Doornbusch|2005|p=25.</ref> However, CSIRAC played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice. CSIRAC was never recorded, but the music played was accurately reconstructed. The oldest known recordings of computer-generated music were played by the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, a commercial version of the Manchester Baby|Baby Machine from the Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester in the autumn of 1951.<ref>harvnb|Fildes|2008</ref> The music program was written by Christopher Strachey.

The impact of computers continued in 1956. Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson composed ''Illiac Suite'' for string quartet, the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using algorithmic composition. "... Hiller postulated that a computer could be taught the rules of a particular style and then called on to compose accordingly."<ref>harvnb|Schwartz|1975|p=347.</ref> Later developments included the work of Max Mathews at Bell Laboratories, who developed the influential MUSIC-N|MUSIC I program in 1957, one of the first computer programs to play electronic music. Vocoder technology was also a major development in this early era. In 1956, Stockhausen composed ''Gesang der Jünglinge'', the first major work of the Cologne studio, based on a text from the ''Book of Daniel''. An important technological development of that year was the invention of the Clavivox synthesizer by Raymond Scott with subassembly by Robert Moog.

Also in 1957, Kid Baltan (Dick Raaymakers) and Tom Dissevelt released their debut album, ''Song Of The Second Moon'', recorded at the Philips studio in the Netherlands.<ref>harvnb|Harris|n.d.</ref> The public remained interested in the new sounds being created around the world, as can be deduced by the inclusion of Varèse's ''Poème électronique'', which was played over four hundred loudspeakers at the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 Expo 58|Brussels World Fair. That same year, Mauricio Kagel, an Argentina|Argentine composer, composed ''Transición II''. The work was realized at the WDR studio in Cologne. Two musicians performed on a piano, one in the traditional manner, the other playing on the strings, frame, and case. Two other performers used tape to unite the presentation of live sounds with the future of prerecorded materials from later on and its past of recordings made earlier in the performance.

Expansion: 1960s

These were fertile years for electronic music&mdash;not just for academia, but for independent artists as synthesizer technology became more accessible. By this time, a strong community of composers and musicians working with new sounds and instruments was established and growing. 1960 witnessed the composition of Luening's ''Gargoyles'' for violin and tape as well as the premiere of Stockhausen's ''Kontakte'' for electronic sounds, piano, and percussion. This piece existed in two versions&mdash;one for 4-channel tape, and the other for tape with human performers. "In ''Kontakte'', Stockhausen abandoned traditional musical form based on linear development and dramatic climax. This new approach, which he termed 'moment form,' resembles the 'cinematic splice' techniques in early twentieth century film."<ref>harvnb|Kurtz|1992|p=1.</ref>

The theremin had been in use since the 1920s but it attained a degree of popular recognition through its use in science-fiction film soundtrack music in the 1950s (e.g., Bernard Herrmann's classic score for ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'').<ref>harvnb|Glinsky|2000|p=286.</ref>

In the UK in this period, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop (established in 1958) came to prominence, thanks in large measure to their work on the BBC science-fiction series ''Doctor Who''. One of the most influential British electronic artists in this period<ref>cite web|url=http://delia-derbyshire.net|title=Delia Derbyshire Audiological Chronology|publisher=</ref> was Workshop staffer Delia Derbyshire, who is now famous for her 1963 electronic realisation of the iconic Doctor Who theme music|''Doctor Who'' theme, composed by Ron Grainer.

Milton Babbitt composed his first electronic work using the synthesizer&mdash;his ''Composition for Synthesizer'' (1961)&mdash;which he created using the RCA synthesizer at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center.

quote|For Babbitt, the RCA synthesizer was a dream come true for three reasons. First, the ability to pinpoint and control every musical element precisely. Second, the time needed to realize his elaborate serial structures were brought within practical reach. Third, the question was no longer "What are the limits of the human performer?" but rather "What are the limits of human hearing?"<ref>harvnb|Schwartz|1975|p=124.</ref>

The collaborations also occurred across oceans and continents. In 1961, Ussachevsky invited Varèse to the Columbia-Princeton Studio (CPEMC). Upon arrival, Varese embarked upon a revision of ''Déserts''. He was assisted by Mario Davidovsky and Bülent Arel.<ref>harvnb|Bayly|1982&ndash;83|p=150.</ref>

The intense activity occurring at CPEMC and elsewhere inspired the establishment of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in 1963 by Morton Subotnick, with additional members Pauline Oliveros, Ramon Sender, Anthony Martin, and Terry Riley.Citation needed|date=April 2015<!--Source for the link between CPEMC and the founding of SFTMC needed.-->

Simultaneously in San Francisco, composer Stan Shaff and equipment designer Doug McEachern, presented the first “Audium” concert at San Francisco State College (1962), followed by a work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1963), conceived of as in time, controlled movement of sound in space.

In this approach, the composition of spatial manipulation is dependent on the location of the speakers and usually exploits the acoustical properties of the enclosure. Examples include Varese's ''Poeme Electronique'' (tape music performed in the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 World Fair, Brussels) and Stanley Schaff's sic ''Audium'' installation, currently active in San Francisco”<ref>harvnb|Begault|1994|p=208, [http://www.cse.yorku.ca/course_archive/2005-06/W/6335/feb20/Begault_2000_3d_Sound_Multimedia.pdf online reprint].</ref> Through weekly programs (over 4,500 in 40 years), Shaff “sculpts” sound, performing now-digitized spatial works live through 176 speakers.<ref>harvnb|Hertelendy|2008.</ref>

A well-known example of the use of Moog's full-sized Moog modular synthesizer is the ''Switched-On Bach'' album by Wendy Carlos, which triggered a craze for synthesizer music.

Along with the Moog modular synthesizer, other makes of this period included ARP and Buchla.

Pietro Grossi was an Italian pioneer of computer composition and tape music, who first experimented with electronic techniques in the early sixties. Grossi was a cellist and composer, born in Venice in 1917. He founded the S 2F M (Studio de Fonologia Musicale di Firenze) in 1963 in order to experiment with electronic sound and composition.

However, CSIRAC played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice which is current computer-music practice.

The first music to be performed in England was a performance of the God Save the King|British National Anthem that was programmed by Christopher Strachey on the Ferranti Mark I, late in 1951.

Main|Live electronic music
Live electronics (or electroacoustic improvisation) is a form of experimental improvised music that developed in response to the rigidity of sound-based composition for fixed media such as musique concrète, early studio based electronic music, and computer music. Musical improvisation often plays a large role in the performance of this music.Citation needed|date=March 2017<!--This last statement, in particular, needs a citation, since the examples given next do not involve improvisation at all.-->

In Europe in 1964, Karlheinz Stockhausen composed ''Mikrophonie (Stockhausen)|Mikrophonie I'' for tam-tam, hand-held microphones, filters, and potentiometers, and ''Mixtur'' for orchestra, four sine wave|sine-wave generators, and four ring modulators.

In the late 1960s, Pop music|pop and rock musicians, including the Beach Boys and the Beatles, began to use electronic instruments, like the theremin and Mellotron, to supplement and define their sound. In his book ''Electronic and Experimental Music'', Thom Holmes recognises the Beatles' 1966 recording "Tomorrow Never Knows" as the song that "ushered in a new era in the use of electronic music in rock and pop music" due to the band's incorporation of tape loops and reversed and speed-manipulated tape sounds.sfn|Holmes|2012|p=468 By the end of the decade, the Moog synthesizer took a leading place in the sound of emerging progressive rock with bands including Pink Floyd, Yes (band)|Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and Genesis (band)|Genesis making them part of their sound. Gershon Kingsley's "Popcorn (instrumental)|Popcorn" was the first international electronic dance hit in 1969.

Electronic rock was also produced by several Japanese musicians, including Isao Tomita's ''Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock'' (1972), which featured Moog synthesizer renditions of contemporary pop and rock songs,<ref name="jenkins_2007"/> and Osamu Kitajima's progressive rock album ''Benzaiten'' (1974).<ref name="Benzaiten">Discogs release|1303605|Osamu Kitajima &ndash; Benzaiten</ref> The mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art music musicians such as Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis, and Isao Tomita|Tomita, who with Brian Eno were a significant influence on the development of new-age music.<ref>harvnb|Holmes|2008|p=403.</ref>

Dub music influenced electronic musical techniques later adopted by hip hop music, when Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc in the early 1970s introduced Jamaica's sound system culture and dub music techniques to America. One such technique that became popular in hip hop culture was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables in alternation, extending the Breakdancing|b-dancers' favorite section.<ref>Nicholas Collins, Margaret Schedel, Scott Wilson (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQeAtG97BmEC&pg=PA105 ''Electronic Music: Cambridge Introductions to Music'', page 105], Cambridge University Press</ref> The turntable eventually went on to become the most visible electronic musical instrument, and occasionally the most virtuosic, in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name="cambridge49"/>

After the arrival of punk rock, a form of basic electronic rock emerged, increasingly using new digital technology to replace other instruments.

Key acts included Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, Spandau Ballet, A Flock of Seagulls, Culture Club, Talk Talk, Japan (band)|Japan, and Eurythmics. Synth-pop sometimes used synthesizers to replace all other instruments, until the style began to fall from popularity in the mid-1980s.<ref name=synthpop />

=Birth of MIDI=
Main|MIDI
In 1980, a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface that new instruments could use to communicate control instructions with other instruments and computers. This standard was dubbed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and resulted from a collaboration between leading manufacturers, initially Sequential Circuits, Oberheim Electronics|Oberheim, Roland Corporation|Roland—and later, other participants that included Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha, Korg, and Kawai (company)|Kawai.<ref>harvnb|Holmes|2008|p=227.</ref> A paper was authored by Dave Smith (engineer)|Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits and proposed to the Audio Engineering Society in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.

MIDI technology allows a single keystroke, control wheel motion, pedal movement, or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and in synchrony, with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer.

MIDI instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals. Acoustic sounds became reintegrated into studios via sampling (music)|sampling and sampled-ROM-based instruments.

Miller Puckette developed graphic signal-processing software for Sogitec 4X|4X called Max (software)|Max (after Max Mathews) and later ported it to Apple Macintosh|Macintosh (with Dave Zicarelli extending it for Opcode Systems|Opcode)<ref>harvnb|Ozab|2000 [http://www.atpm.com/6.05/barline.shtml].</ref> for real-time MIDI control, bringing algorithmic composition availability to most composers with modest computer programming background.

See also|#Live electronics<!-- A prior section which mentioned beginning of "Circuit bending" -->
Circuit bending is the creative customization of the circuits within electronic devices such as low voltage, battery-powered guitar effects, children's toys and small digital synthesizers to create new musical or visual instruments and sound generators. Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with noise music, though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with "bent" instruments. Circuit bending usually involves dismantling the machine and adding components such as switches and potentiometers that alter the circuit. With the revived interest for analogue synthesizers, circuit bending became a cheap solution for many experimental musicians to create their own individual analogue sound generators. Nowadays many schematics can be found to build noise generators such as the Atari Punk Console or the Dub Siren as well as simple modifications for children toys such as the famous Speak & Spell (toy)|Speak & Spells that are often modified by circuit benders. Reed Ghazala has explored circuit bending with the Speak & Spell toy, and has held apprenticeships and workshops on circuit bending.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.anti-theory.com/ |title=Reed Ghazala's Anti-Theory Workshop |publisher=Anti-theory.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24</ref>Failed verification|date=August 2015|reason=self-published site does describes Ghazala as "The Father of Circuit-Bending", but does not say why he is called this; there are ads for workshops and apprenticeships, but no mention of how long these have been offered; "Speak & Spell" is nowhere mentioned on the site.

=Modular synth revival=
Following the circuit bending culture, musicians also began to build their own modular synthesizers, causing a renewed interest for the early 1960s designs. Eurorack became a popular system.
