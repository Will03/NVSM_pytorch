Ministry of Information
The Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information was created during the World War I|First World War and then reformed for the Second World War for propaganda purposes. In the Second World War it was located at the Senate House (University of London)|Senate House of the University of London. During the Second World War it was infamous for having a staff of 999.<ref>cite book|title=999 and all that|first=Norman|last=Riley|publisher=V. Gollancz Ltd|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/203001|year=1940|accessdate=2018-05-11</ref>

The Ministry was responsible for keeping much information out of the public domain during the war years, as it was thought that this would have been harmful to the national sentiment. It also censored many press reports that were not deemed to be sufficiently patriotic, or that listed military operations to a level of detail that could be used by the enemy.

The Ministry took over the General Post Office Film Unit, renaming it the Crown Film Unit. It produced documentaries such as ''Target for Tonight'' (1941), ''Western Approaches'' (1944) and ''London Can Take It!'' (1940). It also created a feature-length fictional film; ''49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel'' (1941). Following this it solely created documentaries, although it also laid down propaganda guidelines for commercial films.

The Ministry was disbanded following the end of the Second World War.  <!-- J.StuartClarke -->

Laws on obscenity and sexual content
Obscenity law in England and Wales is currently governed by the various Obscene Publications Acts, and Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 but obscenity laws go back much further into the English common law.

The conviction in 1727 of Edmund Curll for the publication of ''Venus in the Cloister|Venus in the Cloister or The Nun in her Smock'' under the common law offence of Breach of the peace|disturbing the Queen's peace|King's peace was the first conviction for obscenity in Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain, and set a legal precedent for other convictions.<ref>"[http://www.eroticabibliophile.com/censorship_history.html The Obscenity of Censorship: A History of Indecent People and Lacivious Publications]", The Erotica Bibliophile. Retrieved 29 May 2006.</ref>

A defence against the charge of obscenity on the grounds of literary merit was introduced in the Obscene Publications Act 1959. The OPA was tested in the high-profile obscenity trial brought against Penguin Books for publishing ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' (by D. H. Lawrence) in 1960. The book was found to have merit, and Penguin Books was found not guilty – a ruling which granted far more freedom to publish explicit material.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/10/newsid_2965000/2965194.stm 1960: Lady Chatterley's Lover sold out]", BBC News. Retrieved 29 May 2006.</ref> This trial did not establish the 'merit' defence as an automatic right; several controversial books and publications were the subject of British court cases throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s. ''Last Exit to Brooklyn'', a 1964 novel by United States|American author Hubert Selby, Jr. was subject of a private prosecution in 1966.

There is a substantial overlap between legal erotic literature and illegal pornography, with the distinction traditionally made in the English-speaking courts on the basis of perceived literary merit.

Almost all adult stores in the UK are forbidden from having their goods in open display under the Indecent Displays Act 1981, which means the shop fronts are often boarded up or covered in posters. A warning sign must be clearly shown at the entrance to the store, and no items can be visible from the street. No customer can be under eighteen years old. The Video Recordings Act 1984 introduced the R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18-rated classification for videos that are only available in licensed sex shops, but hardcore pornographic magazines are available in newsagents in some places. The Ann Summers chain of lingerie and sex shops recently won the right to advertise for workers in job centres, which was originally banned under restrictions on what advertising could be carried out by the sex industry.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2999892.stm Sex toys chain wins legal fight]", BBC News, 18 June 2003.

Stage Licensing 
Main|Licensing Act 1737See also|Antitheatricality
Censorship of stage plays was exercised by the Master of the Revels in England by about 1600 until the English Civil War in 1642.<ref>Kincaid, Arthur. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/3821 "Buck (Buc), Sir George (bap. 1560, d. 1622)"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004.

''Thomas Lodge and Other Elizabethans'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, pp. 418–419</ref>

In 1737, partly as a result of political attacks by Henry Fielding against Robert Walpole, Parliament enacted a law that established "the Examiner of the Stage" (an official in the Lord Chamberlain's office) to censor plays on the basis of both politics and morals (''i.e.'' sexual impropriety, blasphemy, and foul language). Plays had to be licensed by the Lord Chamberlain. In 1737, through the influence of the Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton, the Shakespearian commentator Edward Capell was appointed with an annual salary of £200 as deputy-examiner of plays. This censorship by licensing requirement was finally abolished by the Theatres Act 1968.

According to Rufus Osgood Mason (who gives an example of a written license from 1814):

Charles Kemble, later in life, received the appointment of "Examiner of Plays." The duties consisted in reading the plays which had been accepted by the managers of the different theatres, to see that they contained nothing objectionable either on the score of politics or morals. Those that were approved were reported to the Lord Chamberlain who issued the license.<ref>cite book|title=Sketches and impressions, musical, theatrical and social, 1795–1885|chapter=Charles Kemble|author=Mason, Rufus Osgood|year=1887|pages=45–46|location=NY|publisher=G.

Libel law
Main|English defamation law

England and Wales have relatively strict libel laws ("defamation" in Scotland) in that they are often considered pro plaintiff with the defendant asked to prove that they did not commit libel. Compensation awards for libel are also unlimited, in contrast to those for personal injury. Further controversy surrounds the libel laws with regard to costs. Whilst costs can be awarded the ability both to bring and to defend libel cases is often considered to be restricted to the wealthy. Conversely it is possible to initiate a "no win – no fee" case against a wealthy individual or organisation if the individual bringing the case has insignificant assets as even if the case is lost the wealthy individual or organisation are unable to recover their costs. Typically in such cases an out of court settlement is forced upon the wealthy individual or organisation.

A recent example is the case of Simon Singh#Chiropractic lawsuit|Simon Singh's lawsuit, where author and journalist Simon Singh was sued by the British Chiropractic Association for criticism of chiropractic therapy which rested on a summary of recent scientific research. Singh has been able to pursue a legal defence because of his earnings from four best-sellers.

On 15 March 2011, a "Draft Defamation Bill" (CP3/11) was published by the Ministry of Justice with an accompanying "consultation paper containing provisions for reforming the law to strike the right balance between protection of freedom of speech and protection of reputation." (Close date: 10 June 2011)<ref>Draft Defamation Bill: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111013041437/www.justice.gov.uk/consultations/draft-defamation-bill.htm</ref> The Defamation Act 2013 reformed English defamation law on issues of the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation. It also comprised a response to perceptions that the law as it stood was giving rise to libel tourism and other inappropriate claims.

Blasphemy law
Main|Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom
Blasphemy against Christianity was long an important part of British censorship, with the unwritten common law containing an offence of blasphemous libel. Prosecutions were rare, however, the last one being the 1977 ''Gay News'' legal case ''Whitehouse v. Lemon''.  Later developments around the turn of the 21st century put the continued viability of blasphemy prosecutions in doubt.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3753408.stm Q & A: Blasphemy law]", BBC News, 18 October 2004.

Prior restraint
Beyond obscenity law, there have been a number of organisations whose main function was to approve material prior to distribution.

Plays and theatres had long been licensed by the Crown prior to 1737. Licensure of a playhouse, however, only gave a general patent. The crown had no ability to censor before plays were performed. Under the provisions of the Licensing Act|Theatrical Licensing Act of 1737 as extended by the Theatres Act 1843, the Lord Chamberlain's Office was able to censor plays. This role continued until the Theatres Act 1968 abolished the practice following several cause célèbres, and a long campaign by the theatre critic Kenneth Tynan among others.

The British Board of Film Classification is the ''de facto'' film censor for films in the United Kingdom;<ref>[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ British Board of Film Classification], British Board of Film Classification. Retrieved 29 May 2006.</ref> since films not rated by the BBFC cannot be shown in most cinemas, or distributed as videos or DVDs, lack of BBFC approval generally makes productions of such films uneconomic.
*In the case of films shown in cinemas, local authorities have the final legal say about who can watch a particular film. Almost always local authorities accept the Board's recommendation for a certificate for a film.
*Under the Video Recording Act 1984, almost all video recordings must be classified by an authority chosen by the Home Secretary. This classification is then legally binding. Since the introduction of the Act, the BBFC has been the chosen authority. Certain works such as those that are related to sport, religion or which are designed to educate can be exempt from classification by the BBFC under the act.

The Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre pre-approves most British television advertising<ref>[http://www.bacc.org.uk/bacc Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre] Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20041125012741/http://www.bacc.org.uk/bacc# |date=25 November 2004 , Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre.

The Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority is the regulatory advertising body, but can only prevent the republication of advertisements after upholding complaints from the general public.

The advent of the Internet access has made the act of censorship more difficult, and there has been a relaxation of censorship in recognition of this. BBFC guidelines have been relaxed further to allow the limited distribution of hardcore pornography under an R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate, partially because of this, and partially because of a recognition that public attitudes have changed. Further confirmation of this change in attitude was provided by the French film ''Baise-moi'', which was given an 18 certificate despite showing scenes of unsimulated sexual activity.

Ofcom is now the regulatory body for UK television, radio, and telecommunications services since the abolition of the Independent Television Commission.<ref>[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/ Ofcom], Ofcom. Retrieved 29 May 2006.</ref> Ofcom exerts its powers under the Communications Act 2003.

Self-regulation of publication
A number of industries carry out what is known as Industry self-regulation|self-regulation. Self-regulation seeks to keep content within the bounds of what is publicly acceptable, thus preventing government intervention to bring about official regulation. Some of the areas they are concerned about include obscenity, slander and libel. There is no clear line between self-regulation in matters of expression and self-censorship.

Industry self-regulatory bodies include the Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority. In the wake of the Leveson Inquiry the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which had been the main industry regulator of the press in the United Kingdom since 1990, was wound up and most national newspapers now belong to the Independent Press Standards Organisation, established in 2014, refusing to sign up to IMPRESS, the Leveson-compliant alternative.

Freedom of expression and protection of privacy over the Internet is guaranteed by UK law. Nonetheless, since about 2010 there has been a shift toward increased surveillance and police measures. Combating terrorism and preventing child abuse have been widely used by state agencies and private commercial actors (''e.g.'' Internet service providers) to justify the implementation of interception and direct filtering measures. Nevertheless, in 2010 the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) found no evidence of technical filtering in the political, social, conflict/security, or Internet tools areas. The UK openly blocks child pornography websites, for which ONI does not test.<ref>[http://opennet.net/research/profiles/united-kingdom "Country report: United Kingdom"], OpenNet Initiative, 18 December 2010</ref>

Novelist George Orwell wrote several articles on censorship including an item titled ''The Freedom of the Press'' in 1943. It appears that this was a preface for his book ''Animal Farm'', but it is unclear if it had been deliberately suppressed or if Orwell himself chose not to publish it.

<blockquote>Any fair-minded person with journalistic experience will admit that during this war official censorship has not been particularly irksome. We have not been subjected to the kind of totalitarian ‘co-ordination’ that it might have been reasonable to expect. The press has some justified grievances, but on the whole the Government has behaved well and has been surprisingly tolerant of minority opinions. The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary. – George Orwell<ref>George Orwell, 1945. "The Freedom of the Press".

Orwell went on to suggest that because both the UK and the Soviet Union were members of the Allies of World War II|Allied powers at the time, this self-censorship was preventing valid criticism of the Communist regime. Orwell worked for the Ministry of Information during the war and used it as his inspiration for the Ministry of Truth in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.
