Australian hip hop traces its origins to the early 1980s and is largely inspired by hip hop and other predominantly African-American musical genres from the United States.<ref name="Kalantzis">cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029092022/http://www.cbonline.org.au/index.cfm?pageId=12%2C38%2C3%2C454 |url=http://www.cbonline.org.au/index.cfm?pageId=12,38,3,454 |title=Hip Hop – a Way of Life |last=Kalantzis-Cope |first=Phillip |publisher=Community Broadcasting Online (Stephen Hahn).

Australian hip-hop artists have also received international recognition. Australians have been featured on albums by artists from the US and Europe.

Women in Australian hip-hop have largely been under-developed; however, many underground MC's have existed and thrived. Notable artists such as Sampa the Great are on the rise.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/after-her-australian-music-prize-sampa-the-great-wants-to-set-her-story-straight-20180403-h0ya0z.html|title=After the Australian Music Prize, Sampa the Great wants to set her story straight|last=Valentish|first=Jenny|date=2018-04-05|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30</ref>

Style and influences
Australian hip hop artists are strongly influenced by African American and Latino rappers from the US, and continue to incorporate such influences into their music.<ref name="Quartermaine">cite web|last=Quartermaine|first=Craig|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/11/05/hip-hop-artist-raps-against-racism|title=Hip Hop artist raps against racism|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006162515/https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/11/05/hip-hop-artist-raps-against-racism|archivedate=6 October 2014|publisher=NITV News</ref> Australian artists, however, still utilise an authentic and unique style in their own music.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0219,christgau,34334,22.html|title=New York Music News, Concerts and Reviews - Village Voice|work=Village Voice</ref> Like many hip hop scenes outside the US, some Australian hip hop artists have also been influenced by funk and dancehall.<ref name="Marshall">cite web |url=http://wayneandwax.blogspot.com/2005/12/downunder-underground.html |title=downunder underground |last=Marshall |first=Wayne |date=29 December 2005 |accessdate=2008-04-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080415005534/http://wayneandwax.blogspot.com/2005/12/downunder-underground.html| archivedate= 15 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no</ref> Indigenous Australian culture is also a strong influence for many hip hop artists.<ref name="Sydney Stylee" /><ref name="New Corroboree">cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/the-new-corroboree/2006/03/30/1143441270792.html |title=Tony Mitchell, The New Corroboree, 1 April 2006, '&#39;The Age'&#39; |publisher=Theage.com.au |date= 1 April 2006|accessdate=2012-01-05</ref>

While hip hop artists in the US are predominantly African American, many Australian hip hop artists are of Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo heritage. Numerous Australian hip hop artists, including N'fa, Remi, Sampa the Great, Diafrix, Tkay Maidza, Miracle (rapper)|Miracle, Vida Sunshyne, KillaQueenz, are of African descent, which has influenced their music.<ref name="Phat of the land">cite web|title=Phat of the land|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/music/phat-of-the-land/2009/08/06/1249350628968.html?page=2|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald</ref>

In Australia, dance moves associated with hip hop, like krumping, Footwork (Chicago)|footworking, Locking (dance)|locking and popping, have drawn public interest to hip hop, and contributed to its dynamic popularity.<ref>Henderson, April K. "Dancing Between Islands: Hip-Hop and the Samoan Diaspora" p.180-197</ref> However, these dance moves have been criticized as not being original and a sign that Australia suffers from a lack of its own hip-hop identity.<ref>Park, M. & G. Northwood. "Australian Dance Culture." http://www.snarl.org/texts/features/dancecult2.htm. Accessed 18 April 2008.</ref>

=United Kingdom influence=

In more recent years (2000s onwards), Australian Hip Hop has seen a strong emergence of UK genres such as Grime and Afrobeat. Although these genres have been around for decades their worldwide popularity and acceptance in the mainstream is relatively new. The genre of 'Australian Grime' has been marked by viral artists like HAZRD. Adelaide-based producer [https://soundcloud.com/strictface Strict Face] is also renowned for forward thinking Grime productions and hosts his own show on London's [http://www.radarradio.com/ Radar Radio]. 

=Australian identity=

Although hip hop originated in the US, some Australian rappers see their hip hop scene as having its own unique character. Dialectrix has described it as a "mongrel mutation" of Afro-centric and Australian culture.<ref name="The Vine"/> According to the lyrics of Def Wish Cast, it is "down under, comin' up."<ref name="Sydney Stylee" /><ref name="Mitchell">Mitchell, Tony. "World Music and the Popular Music Industry: An Australian View." ''Ethnomusicology,'' Vol. 37, No. 3 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 309–338.</ref>

Australian hip hop has been localised with the introduction of aspects such as the Australian accent, Australian slang, political views, and references to localities and matters of Australian cultural identity. The lyrics of early Western Sydney artists like 046, Def Wish Cast and the White Boys represent the process of localising Australian hip hop. Additionally, the non-Anglo immigrants of these areas were attracted to hip hop because it tackles the theme of racial opposition, as in African American and Chicano hip hop.<ref name="Tony" /> Australian hip hop has been described as rich with Australian character, but also as inspirational for immigrants, providing "a voice and a purpose for those making their home anew in Australia."<ref name="Phat of the land"/> For example, Diafrix use migrant experiences in some of their songs, although this is not their main focus.<ref name="redbull.com.au">http://www.redbull.com.au/cs/Satellite/en_AU/Article/Diafrix-on-how-theyre-running-it-in-2013-021243330130007</ref>

Numerous Australian hip-hop artists have expressed concern that sections of Australia's hip hop fanbase seem to espouse a "redneck" mentality that is ignorant of the culture's international influences.<ref name="The Vine"/><ref name="Quartermaine"/> In a 2009 interview, Cross Bred Mongrels member Flak explained: "I don't go for that. [Only listening to Australian hip hop] I think that is a little narrow-minded. If it is dope hip hop, it is dope hip hop. If it is from Germany, Japan or Compton, and it is dope, I go for it."<ref>cite web|author1=Gareth Bryant|title=Cross Bred Mongrels Interview|url=http://www.scenemagazine.com.au/music/urban/cross-bred-mongrels-interview|website=Scene Magazine|publisher=Eyeball Media Pty Ltd|accessdate=5 October 2014|date=30 September 2009</ref> Over time, Australian hip hop diversified, absorbing influences from New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the Caribbean. For example, Def Wish described his style as influenced by reggae from London, rather than North American rap, while also acknowledging Afro-Caribbean roots of that scene.<ref name="Maxwell">cite book|author=Ian Maxwell|title=Phat Beats, Dope Rhymes: Hip Hop Down Under Comin' Upper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LYIqnwEACAAJ|date=10 November 2003|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0-8195-6638-6|quote=Def Wish took pains to tell me that his style is influenced by London reggae rap rather than North American rap, conceding the Afro-Caribbean "roots" of that scene, but carefully distancing himself from charges of imitation or of subjection to a putative American cultural imperialism.</ref>

=Gutter rap=

Completely distinguishing itself from most Australian Hip Hop at the time, that rap about Middle-class lifestyle and issues (such as breakups, skating, going to the RSL), a new scene originating from Australia's infamous Public housing in Australia|Housing Commission estates began emerging in the late 2000's called Gutter rap (sometimes known as Lad rap). Gutter rap artists such as Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown's Kerser, Hurstville's Skeamo and Nter, and Blacktown's Fortay rap primarily about Australian Lower social class|Lower-class lifestyle and issues (such as crime, drug addictions, financial struggles), similar to traditional American Gangsta rap, which resulted it in being branded an Australian version of the American music genre. Unlike most other Australian hip hop scenes, which have proper mainstream presence and support, gutter rap remains underground on the internet, but that didn't stop artists from the genre gaining mainstream recognition and success, an example being Kersers second album ''No Rest for the Sickest'' reaching No. 15 on the ARIA Charts|ARIA albums chart,<ref name="arianorest">cite news
