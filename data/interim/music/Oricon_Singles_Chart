The Oricon Singles Chart is the Japanese music industry standard Single (music)|singles popularity chart issued daily, weekly, monthly and yearly by Oricon. Chart rankings are based on physical singles' sales. Oricon does not include download sales. In Japan, physical sales decreased sharply in the 2000s, while download sales hit three to four times the amount of single sales.<ref>Statistics will be given below: [http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/data/download/index.html RIAJ.or.jp]</ref>

Original Confidence Inc., the original Oricon company, was founded by the former Snow Brand Milk Products promoter Sōkō Koike in 1967. That November, the company began publishing a singles chart on an experimental basis. 
Entitled Nihongo||総合芸能市場調査|Sōgō Geinō Shijō Chōsa|Surveys of total entertainment markets, it went official on January 4, 1968. citation needed lead|date=December 2014

Charts are published every Tuesday in Oricon Style and on Oricon’s official website. Every Monday, Oricon receives data from outlets, but data on merchandise sold through certain channels does not make it into the charts. For example, the debut single of News (band)|NEWS, a pop group, was released only through 7-Eleven stores, which are not covered by Oricon, and its sales were not reflected in the Oricon charts. Oricon’s rankings of record sales are therefore not completely accurate. Before data was collected electronically, the charts were compiled on the basis of faxes that were sent from record shops.citation needed lead|date=December 2014

The first number-one song on the Oricon Singles Chart was ":ja:北国の二人|Kitaguni no Futari (In a Lonesome City)" by :ja:ジャッキー吉川とブルー・コメッツ|Jackey Yoshikawa and his Blue Comets on November 2, 1967.
