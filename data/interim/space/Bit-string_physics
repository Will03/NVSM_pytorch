Bit-string physics is a body of theory which supposes that reality can be represented by a process of operations on finite strings of dichotomous symbols, or bits (1's and 0's). Bit-string physics has developed from Frederick Parker-Rhodes' 1964 discovery of the combinatorial hierarchy: four numbers produced from a purely mathematical recursive algorithm that correspond to the relative strengths of the four forces. These strengths are characterized by the strong, weak, electromagnetic (fine-structure constant), and gravitational coupling constants.<ref name= bastin>Ted Bastin and C.W.

In a 2001 paper by Noyes, evidence was presented for predictions made by the theory that were later confirmed.<ref>cite web |title= Observational Evidence for Two Cosmological Predictions Made by Bit-String Physics |work= Publication 8779 |date= March 23, 2001 |author= H.
