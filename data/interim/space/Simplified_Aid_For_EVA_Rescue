Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) is a small, self-contained, propulsive backpack system (jet pack) worn during spacewalks, to be used in case of emergency only. If an untethered astronaut were to lose physical contact with the vessel, it would provide free-flying mobility to return to it. It is worn on spacewalks outside the International Space Station (ISS), and was worn on spacewalks outside the Space Shuttle. So far, there has not been an emergency in which it was needed.<ref name="day8-92">Cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-92/sts-92-day-08-highlights.html|title=STS-92 Day 8 Highlights|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2000|author=NASA</ref><ref name="A Flying Astronaut Over Earth">Cite web|url=http://www.sai.msu.su/apod/ap011002.html|title=Astronomy Picture of the Day A Flying Astronaut Over Earth  |accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2001|author=APOD</ref> SAFER is a small, simplified version of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), which was used for regular maneuvering.<ref name="assembly">Cite web|url=http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption.jsp?searchpage=true&keywords=SAFER&textsearch=Go&hitsperpage=5&pageno=3&photoId=S93-50137|title=SAFER Assembly|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=1993|author=NASA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613224209/http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption.jsp?searchpage=true&keywords=SAFER&textsearch=Go&hitsperpage=5&pageno=3&photoId=S93-50137|archivedate=June 13, 2011|df=</ref>

Application
SAFER is designed to be used as a self-rescue device if in spite of precautions such as tethers, safety grips, and the robot arm an EVA crewmember gets separated and no vehicles can provide rescue capability.<ref name="nyt">cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E5D61F38F933A2575AC0A962958260|title=Shuttle Soars Into Orbit to Test Device for Space Rescues |accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=The New York Times|author=Broad, William J. | date=September 10, 1994</ref> SAFER is worn by every ISS crewmember using an Extravehicular Mobility Unit. SAFER was co-invented by former astronaut Joseph Kerwin, Paul Cottingham and Ted Christian under a Lockheed contract to NASA for Space Station Freedom. It was later sponsored by the Space Shuttle Program and developed by Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed and NASA personnel. Ralph Anderson (NASA)|Ralph Anderson was the Shuttle Program Office's Project Manager for the SAFER Development Test Objective (DTO).  Cliff Hess was the NASA Project Engineer. The device was developed by the Robotics Division (with its Lockheed staff) of NASA at the Johnson Space Center.  The SAFER was the design solution to the Shuttle Program's requirement to provide a means of self rescue should an EVA crewmember become untethered during an EVA.

SAFER was first flown on STS-64 September 9, 1994, where an untethered flight test was performed first by astronaut Mark C. Lee|Mark Lee and then Carl Meade. Both astronauts flew the SAFER up and around the Shuttle's Canadarm|Robotic Arm along with a demonstration test of the SAFER's automatic attitude hold feature.  This feature arrests uncontrolled rotation of a detached crewmember expected in an accidental separation.  SAFER has a mass of approximately 83&nbsp;lb (38&nbsp;kg) and can provide a total change in velocity (delta-v) of at least 10&nbsp;ft/s (3&nbsp;m/s).<ref name="nyt"/> It was also tested during flight STS-92 when astronauts Peter Wisoff and Michael López-Alegría performed test maneuvers, flying up to 50 feet (15&nbsp;m) while remaining tethered to the spacecraft.<ref>[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-92/news/sts-92-mcc-15.txt STS-92 NASA Mission Report #15] NASA, 2008-10-18.</ref>

Complications

The left side latch on the SAFER unit became unlatched during an EVA by astronaut Piers Sellers on STS-121 while testing shuttle repair techniques.<ref name="msnbc">Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13815044/|title=Duct tape suggested for spacewalk repair|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=MSNBC|year=2006|author=Mike Schneider for the Associated Press</ref><ref name="drama">Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9524-high-drama-spacewalk-ends-in-success.html|title=High drama spacewalk ends in success|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=New Scientist|year=2006|author=Kelly Young</ref> The latch had been inadvertently bumped and moved to the unlatch position.  As a precaution, Mike Fossum tethered it to him and the spacewalk continued.<ref name="spacecom">Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/060712_sts121_eva3.html|title=Spacewalkers Test Shuttle Heat Shield Repair Technique |accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=Space.com|year=2006|author=Tariq Malik</ref> In subsequent spacewalks, the latches were secured with Kapton tape, a space-rated form of adhesive tape, to prevent the latches from inadvertently opening. A hard cover is being designed for future missions.Citation needed|reason=No proof|date=August 2017
