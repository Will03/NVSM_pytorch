In the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon.

On 4 October 1957 the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. Since then, about 8,100 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched. According to a 2018 estimate, some 4,900 remain in orbit, of those about 1,900 were operational; while the rest have lived out their useful lives and become space debris.<ref name="Pixalytics">cite web |url=https://www.pixalytics.com/sats-orbiting-the-earth-2018/ |website=Pixalytics | title =How many satellites are orbiting earth in 2018 |accessdate=27 Sep 2018 |date=22 Aug 2018</ref> Approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-Earth orbit, 50 are in medium-Earth orbit (at 20,000&nbsp;km), and the rest are in geostationary orbit (at 36,000&nbsp;km).<ref name="FCain">cite web |last=Cain |first=Fraser | title=How Many Satellites are in Space?

Satellites are used for many purposes. Among several other applications, they can be used to make star maps and maps of planetary surfaces, and also take pictures of planets they are launched into. Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites, communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and space telescopes. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on the purpose of the satellite, and are classified in a number of ways. Well-known (overlapping) classes include low Earth orbit, polar orbit, and geostationary orbit.

A launch vehicle is a rocket that places a satellite into orbit. Usually, it lifts off from a launch pad on land. Some are launched at sea from a Submarine-based launch vehicle|submarine or a Sea Launch|mobile maritime platform, or aboard a plane (see air launch to orbit).

Satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems. Satellite subsystems attend many tasks, such as power generation, Spacecraft thermal control|thermal control, telemetry, attitude control and orbit control.

"Newton's cannonball", presented as a "thought experiment" in ''A Treatise of the System of the World'', by Isaac Newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite.

The first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by Edward Everett Hale, ''The Brick Moon''.<ref>cite web

In 1903, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857–1935) published ''Exploring Space Using Jet Propulsion Devices'' (in Russian language|Russian: ''Исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами''), which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft. He calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit, and that a multi-stage rocket fuelled by liquid propellants could achieve this.

In 1928, Herman Potočnik (1892–1929) published his sole book, ''The Problem of Space Travel – The Rocket Motor'' (German language|German: ''Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums – der Raketen-Motor''). He described the use of orbiting spacecraft for observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments.

In a 1945 ''Wireless World'' article, the English science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke (1917–2008) described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications.<ref>cite book | title=Visions of Technology

File:Sputnik asm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Sputnik 1: The first artificial satellite to orbit Earth.
The first artificial satellite was Sputnik 1, launched by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, and initiating the Soviet Union|Soviet Sputnik program, with Sergei Korolev as chief designer. This in turn triggered the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States.

Sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high Earth's atmosphere#Temperature and layers|atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere. The unanticipated announcement of Sputnik 1's success precipitated the Sputnik crisis in the United States and ignited the so-called Space Race within the Cold War.

Sputnik 2 was launched on 3 November 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit, a dog named Laika.<ref name="nasa_animals">cite web | title=A Brief History of Animals in Space |url=https://history.nasa.gov/animals.html | first=Tara | last=Gray | first2=Steve | last2=Garber | website= | publisher=NASA | date=2 August 2004</ref>

In May, 1946, Project RAND had released the Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship, which stated, "A satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the Twentieth Century."<ref>

The United States had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the Bureau of Aeronautics of the United States Navy. The United States Air Force's Project RAND eventually released the report, but considered the satellite to be a tool for science, politics, and propaganda, rather than a potential military weapon. In 1954, the Charles Erwin Wilson|Secretary of Defense stated, "I know of no American satellite program."<ref>cite book | title=Venture Into Space: Early Years of Goddard Space Flight Center

In the context of activities planned for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58), the White House announced on 29 July 1955 that the U.S. intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as Project Vanguard. On 31 July, the Soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.

Following pressure by the American Rocket Society, the National Science Foundation, and the International Geophysical Year, military interest picked up and in early 1955 the Army and Navy were working on Project Orbiter, two competing programs: the army's which involved using a Jupiter-C IRBM|Jupiter C rocket, and the civilian/Navy Vanguard Rocket, to launch a satellite. At first, they failed: initial preference was given to the Vanguard program, whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television. But finally, three months after Sputnik 2, the project succeeded; Explorer 1 became the United States' first artificial satellite on 31 January 1958.<ref>cite news|title=50th anniversary of first U.S. satellite launch celebrated |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/01/30/state/n151715S68.DTL |agency=Associated Press |first=Alicia |last=Chang |work= |publisher=SFGate |date=30 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=1 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201193510/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2008%2F01%2F30%2Fstate%2Fn151715S68.DTL</ref>

In June 1961, three-and-a-half years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the Air Force used resources of the United States Space Surveillance Network to catalog 115 Earth-orbiting satellites.<ref>cite web|first=David S.

Early satellites were constructed as "wikt:one-off|one-off" designs. With growth in Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous (GEO) communication satellite|satellite communication, multiple satellites began to be built on Comparison of satellite buses|single model platforms called satellite buses. The first standardized satellite bus design was the HS-333 GEO commsat, launched in 1972.

Currently the largest artificial satellite ever is the International Space Station.

Space Surveillance Network
Main|United States Space Surveillance Network

The United States Space Surveillance Network (SSN), a division of the United States Strategic Command, has been tracking objects in Earth's orbit since 1957 when the Soviet Union opened the Space Age with the launch of Sputnik I. Since then, the SSN has tracked more than 26,000 objects. The SSN currently tracks more than 8,000 man-made orbiting objects. The rest have re-entered Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted the Earth. The SSN tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger; those now orbiting Earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds. About seven percent are operational satellites (i.e. ~560 satellites), the rest are space debris.<ref>cite web|title=Orbital Debris Education Package |url=http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/EducationPackage.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Lyndon B.

 Non-military satellite services 
There are three basic categories of non-military satellite services:<ref name=Grant&Meadows>cite book | last1=Grant | first1=A. | last2=Meadows | first2=J. | year=2004 | title=Communication Technology Update | edition=ninth | page=284 | publisher=Focal Press | isbn=978-0-240-80640-2</ref>

=Mobile satellite systems=
main|Mobile-satellite service
Mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions, vehicles, ships, people and aircraft to other parts of the world and/or other mobile or stationary communications units, in addition to serving as navigation systems.

= anchor|Research satellites Scientific research satellites (commercial and noncommercial) =
Scientific research satellites provide meteorological information, land survey data (e.g. remote sensing), Amateur (HAM) Radio, and other different scientific research applications such as earth science, marine science, and atmospheric research.

Types
* Astronomical satellites are satellites used for observation of distant planets, galaxies, and other outer space objects.
* Biosatellites are satellites designed to carry living organisms, generally for scientific experimentation.
* Communication satellites are satellites stationed in space for the purpose of telecommunications. Modern communications satellites typically use geosynchronous orbits, Molniya orbits or Low Earth orbits.
* Earth observation satellites are satellites intended for non-military uses such as environment (biophysical)|environmental monitoring, meteorology, map making etc. (See especially Earth Observing System.)
* Global Navigation Satellite System|Navigational satellites are satellites which use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location. The relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground, combined with ever-improving electronics, allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time.
* Killer Satellites are satellites that are designed to destroy enemy warheads, satellites, and other space assets.
* Crewed spacecraft (spaceships) are large satellites able to put humans into (and beyond) an orbit, and return them to Earth. Spacecraft including spaceplanes of reusable launch system|reusable systems have major Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion or landing facilities. They can be used as transport to and from the orbital stations.
* Miniaturized satellites are satellites of unusually low masses and small sizes.<ref>cite web | page=6 | title=Workshop on the Use of Microsatellite Technologies | url=http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/reports/ac105/AC105_903E.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=United Nations | year=2008 | accessdate=6 March 2008</ref> New classifications are used to categorize these satellites: minisatellite (500–100&nbsp;kg), Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellite (below 100&nbsp;kg), nanosatellite (below 10&nbsp;kg).citation needed|date=December 2012
* Reconnaissance satellites are Earth observation satellite or communications satellite deployed for military or espionage|intelligence applications. Very little is known about the full power of these satellites, as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classified.
* Recovery satellites are satellites that provide a recovery of reconnaissance, biological, space-production and other payloads from orbit to Earth.

* Space-based solar power satellites are proposed satellites that would collect energy from sunlight and transmit it for use on Earth or other places.
* Space stations are artificial orbital structures that are designed for human|human beings to live on in outer space. A space station is distinguished from other crewed spacecraft by its lack of major propulsion or landing facilities. Space stations are designed for medium-term living in orbit, for periods of weeks, months, or even years.
* Tether satellites are satellites which are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a tether.
* Weather satellites are primarily used to monitor Earth's weather and climate.<ref>cite web|title=Earth Observations from Space |url=http://dels.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/earth_observations_final.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=National Academy of Science |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112000950/http://dels.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/earth_observations_final.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-12</ref>

Orbit types
Main|List of orbits

File:Orbits around earth scale diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Various earth orbits to scale; cyan represents low earth orbit, yellow represents medium earth orbit, the black dashed line represents geosynchronous orbit, the green dash-dot line the orbit of Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and the red dotted line the orbit of the International Space Station (ISS).

The first satellite, Sputnik 1, was put into orbit around Earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit. By far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 1,886<ref name="UCS-SatDB">cite web|title=UCS Satellite Database|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/space-weapons/satellite-database|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=27 September 2018|date=10 August 2018</ref> artificial satellites orbiting the Earth. Geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude, inclination and Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity.

The commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are Low Earth orbit (LEO), Medium Earth orbit (MEO) and High Earth orbit (HEO). Low Earth orbit is any orbit below 2,000 km. Medium Earth orbit is any orbit between 2,000 and 35,786&nbsp;km. High Earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35,786&nbsp;km.

=Centric classifications=
* Geocentric orbit: An orbit around the planet Earth, such as the Moon or artificial satellites. Currently there are approximately 1,886<ref name="UCS-SatDB" /> artificial satellites orbiting the Earth.
* Heliocentric orbit: An orbit around the Sun. In our Solar System, all planets, comets, and asteroids are in such orbits, as are many artificial satellites and pieces of space debris. Natural satellite#Natural satellites of the Solar System|Moons by contrast are not in a heliocentric orbit but rather orbit their parent planet.
* Areocentric orbit: An orbit around the planet Mars, such as by Moons of Mars|moons or artificial satellites.
The general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial links.

=Altitude classifications=
* Low Earth orbit (LEO): Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 180&nbsp;km – convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on
* Medium Earth orbit (MEO): Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on – convert|35786|km|mi|abbr=on. Also known as an intermediate circular orbit.
* Geosynchronous orbit (GEO): Geocentric circular orbit with an altitude of convert|35,786|km|mi. The period of the orbit equals one sidereal day, coinciding with the rotation period of the Earth. The speed is approximately convert|3,000|m/s|ft/s.
* High Earth orbit (HEO): Geocentric orbits above the altitude of geosynchronous orbit convert|35786|km|mi|abbr=on.
File:Orbitalaltitudes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Orbital Altitudes of several significant satellites of earth.

=Inclination classifications=
* Inclined orbit: An orbit whose inclination in reference to the equatorial plane is not zero degrees.
** Polar orbit: An orbit that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution. Therefore, it has an inclination of (or very close to) 90 degree (angle)|degrees.
** Polar sun synchronous orbit: A nearly polar orbit that passes the equator at the same local time on every pass. Useful for image taking satellites because shadows will be nearly the same on every pass.

=Eccentricity classifications=
* Circular orbit: An orbit that has an Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity of 0 and whose path traces a circle.
** Hohmann transfer orbit: An orbit that moves a spacecraft from one approximately circular orbit, usually the orbit of a planet, to another, using two engine Impulse (physics)|impulses. The perihelion of the transfer orbit is at the same distance from the Sun as the radius of one planet's orbit, and the aphelion is at the other. The two rocket burns change the spacecraft's path from one circular orbit to the transfer orbit, and later to the other circular orbit. This maneuver was named after Walter Hohmann.
* Elliptic orbit: An orbit with an eccentricity greater than 0 and less than 1 whose orbit traces the path of an ellipse.
** Geosynchronous transfer orbit: An elliptic orbit where the perigee is at the altitude of a Low Earth orbit (LEO) and the apogee at the altitude of a geosynchronous orbit.
** Geostationary transfer orbit: An elliptic orbit where the perigee is at the altitude of a Low Earth orbit (LEO) and the apogee at the altitude of a geostationary orbit.
** Molniya orbit: A highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4° and orbital period of half of a sidereal day (roughly 12 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over two designated areas of the planet (specifically Russia and the United States).
** Tundra orbit: A highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4° and orbital period of one sidereal day (roughly 24 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a single designated area of the planet.

=Synchronous classifications=
* Synchronous orbit: An orbit where the satellite has an orbital period equal to the average rotational period (earth's is: 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.091 seconds) of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body. To a ground observer such a satellite would trace an analemma (figure 8) in the sky.
* Semi-synchronous orbit (SSO): An orbit with an altitude of approximately convert|20200|km|mi|abbr=on and an orbital period equal to one-half of the average rotational period (Earth's is approximately 12 hours) of the body being orbited
* Geosynchronous orbit (GSO): Orbits with an altitude of approximately convert|35786|km|mi|abbr=on. Such a satellite would trace an analemma (figure 8) in the sky.
** Geostationary orbit (GEO): A geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of zero. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.<ref>cite web | title=Pearl Harbor In Space | first=James | last=Oberg | url=http://www.jamesoberg.com/pearl.html | work=Omni (magazine)|Omni | date=July 1984 | pages=42–44 | authorlink=James Oberg</ref>
*** Clarke orbit: Another name for a geostationary orbit. Named after scientist and writer Arthur C. Clarke.
** Supersynchronous orbit: A disposal / storage orbit above GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift west. Also a synonym for Disposal orbit.
** Subsynchronous orbit: A drift orbit close to but below GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift east.
** Graveyard orbit: An orbit a few hundred kilometers above geosynchronous that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation.
*** Disposal orbit: A synonym for graveyard orbit.
*** Junk orbit: A synonym for disposal orbit.
* Areosynchronous orbit: A synchronous orbit around the planet Mars with an orbital period equal in length to Mars' sidereal day, 24.6229 hours.
* Areostationary orbit (ASO): A circular areosynchronous orbit on the equatorial plane and about 17000&nbsp;km (10557 miles) above the surface. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.
* Heliosynchronous orbit: A heliocentric orbit about the Sun where the satellite's orbital period matches the Sun's period of rotation. These orbits occur at a radius of 24,360 gigametre|Gm (0.1628 Astronomical unit|AU) around the Sun, a little less than half of the orbital radius of Mercury (planet)|Mercury.

=Special classifications=
* Sun-synchronous orbit: An orbit which combines altitude and inclination in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planets' surface at the same local solar time. Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for Satellite imagery|imaging, spy satellite|spy, and weather satellites.
* Moon orbit: The Orbital parameters|orbital characteristics of Earth's Moon. Average altitude of convert|384403|km|mi|sp=us, elliptical orbit|elliptical–inclined orbit.

= Pseudo-orbit classifications =
* Horseshoe orbit: An orbit that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a certain planet but is actually in Co-orbital satellite|co-orbit with the planet. See asteroids 3753 Cruithne|3753 (Cruithne) and 2002 AA29|2002 AA<sub>29</sub>.
* Exo-orbit: A maneuver where a spacecraft approaches the height of orbit but lacks the velocity to sustain it.
** Suborbital spaceflight: A synonym for exo-orbit.
* Lunar transfer orbit (LTO)
* Prograde orbit: An orbit with an inclination of less than 90°. Or rather, an orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary.
* Retrograde orbit: An orbit with an inclination of more than 90°. Or rather, an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet. Apart from those in sun-synchronous orbit, few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a prograde orbit. This is because when the rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude.
* Halo orbit and Lissajous orbit: Orbits "around" Lagrangian points.

Satellite subsystems
The satellite's functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics. Looking at the "anatomy" of a typical satellite, one discovers two modules.<ref name=Grant&Meadows /> Note that some novel architectural concepts such as Fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomy.

=Spacecraft bus or service module=
The Spacecraft bus|bus module consists of the following subsystems:

Structural subsystem
The structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch, maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit, and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage.

Telemetry subsystem
The telemetry subsystem (aka Command and Data Handling, C&DH) monitors the on-board equipment operations, transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station, and receives the earth control station's commands to perform equipment operation adjustments.

Power subsystem
The power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power, regulation and distribution functions, and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the Earth's shadow. Nuclear power sources (Radioisotope thermoelectric generator) have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the Nimbus program (1964–1978).<ref>cite journal | title=Radioisotope-based Nuclear Power Strategy for Exploration Systems Development | volume=813 | pages=334 | url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/schmidtstaif06.pdf | format=PDF | first=George | last=Schmidt | first2=Mike | last2=Houts | journal=STAIF Nuclear Symposium | date=16 February 2006| bibcode=2006AIPC..813..334S | doi=10.1063/1.2169210 </ref>

Thermal control subsystem
Main|Spacecraft thermal control
The thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellite's body (e.g. optical solar reflector)

Attitude and orbit control subsystem
Main|Attitude control|Spacecraft propulsion
The attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation, control laws embedded in the flight software, and actuators (reaction wheels, Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters). These apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude, keep the satellite in the correct orbital position, and keep antennas pointed in the right directions.

=Communication payload=
The second major module is the communication payload, which is made up of transponders. A transponder is capable of :
* Receiving uplinked radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations (antennas).
* Amplifying received radio signals
* Sorting the input signals and directing the output signals through input/output signal multiplexers to the proper downlink antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations (antennas).

End of life
When satellites reach the end of their mission (this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch), satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite, leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit. Historically, due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions, satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited. One example of this practice is the satellite Vanguard 1. Launched in 1958, Vanguard 1, the 4th manmade satellite put in Geocentric orbit, was still in orbit as of|lc=y|2015|03, as well as the upper stage of its launch rocket.<ref name=ha20130921a>cite web |title=Vanguard 1 – Satellite Information |url=http://www.heavens-above.com/SatInfo.aspx?satid=5&lat=0&lng=0&loc=Unspecified&alt=0&tz=UCT |work=Satellite database |publisher=Heavens-Above |accessdate=2015-03-07 </ref><ref name=ha20130921b>cite web |title=Vanguard 1 Rocket – Satellite Information |url=http://www.heavens-above.com/SatInfo.aspx?satid=16&lat=0&lng=0&loc=Unspecified&alt=0&tz=UCT |work=Satellite database |publisher=Heavens-Above |accessdate=2015-03-07 </ref>

Instead of being de-orbited, most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit.<ref>

The nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78&nbsp;km, with a range between 72 and 84&nbsp;km. Solar panels, however, are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95&nbsp;km.<ref>cite web | url=http://www.satview.org/spacejunk.php?sat_id=34602U | title=Object SL-8 R/B – 29659U – 06060B | work=Forecast for Space Junk Reentry | publisher=Satview | date=11 March 2014</ref>

Launch-capable countries
Main|Timeline of first orbital launches by nationality

This list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit, including production of the necessary launch vehicle. Note: many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites but are unable to launch them, instead relying on foreign launch services. This list does not consider those numerous countries, but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously, and the date this capability was first demonstrated. The list does not include the European Space Agency, a multi-national state organization, nor private consortiums.

=Attempted first launches=
Expand section|date=May 2012
* The United States tried in 1957 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1958.
* Japan tried four times in 1966–1969 to launch a satellite with its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1970.
* China tried in 1969 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1970.
* India, after launching its first national satellite using a foreign launcher in 1975, tried in 1979 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before succeeding in 1980.
* Iraq have claimed an orbital launch of a warhead in 1989, but this claim was later disproved.#tag:ref|The video tape of a partial launch attempt which was retrieved by United Nations Special Commission|UN weapons inspectors later surfaced showing that the rocket prematurely exploded 45 seconds after its launch.<ref>cite web | url=http://www.thespacereview.com/archive/1498.pdf | format=PDF | title=UNMOVIC report | publisher=United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission | date= | page=434 ff</ref><ref>cite web | url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/iraq/deception.htm| title=Deception Activities – Iraq Special Weapons | website= | publisher=FAS | date= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990422131634/https://fas.org/nuke/guide/iraq/deception.htm| archivedate=22 April 1999</ref><ref>cite web | url=http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets_1/Rest_World/Al_Abid/Description/Frame.htm | title=Al-Abid LV | website= | publisher= | date=</ref>
* Brazil, after launching its first national satellite using a foreign launcher in 1985, tried to launch a satellite using its own VLS 1 launcher three times in 1997, 1999, and 2003, but all attempts were unsuccessful.
* North Korea claimed a launch of Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1 and Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2 satellites in 1998 and 2009, but U.S., Russian and other officials and weapons experts later reported that the rockets failed to send a satellite into orbit, if that was the goal. The United States, Japan and South Korea believe this was actually a ballistic missile test, which was a claim also made after North Korea's 1998 satellite launch, and later rejected.by whom|date=April 2013 The first (April 2012) launch of Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 was unsuccessful, a fact publicly recognized by the DPRK. However, the December 2012 launch of the "second version" of Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 was successful, putting the DPRK's first confirmed satellite into orbit.
* South Korea (Korea Aerospace Research Institute), after launching their first national satellite by foreign launcher in 1992, unsuccessfully tried to launch its own launcher, the Korea Space Launch Vehicle|KSLV (Naro)-1, (created with the assistance of Russia) in 2009 and 2010 until success was achieved in 2013 by Naro-3.
* The First European multi-national state organization European Launcher Development Organisation|ELDO tried to make the orbital launches at Europa (rocket)|Europa I and Europa II rockets in 1968–1970 and 1971 but stopped operation after failures.

=Other notes=
* note|RUS-UKR Russia and the Ukraine were parts of the Soviet Union and thus inherited their launch capability without the need to develop it indigenously. Through the Soviet Union they are also on the number one position in this list of accomplishments.
* France, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine launched their first satellites by own launchers from foreign spaceports.
* Some countries such as South Africa, Spain, Italy, Germany, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Egypt and private companies such as OTRAG, have developed their own launchers, but have not had a successful launch.
* Only twelve, countries from the list below (USSR, USA, France, Japan, China, UK, India, Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Iran and North Korea) and one regional organization (the European Space Agency, ESA) have independently launched satellites on their own indigenously developed launch vehicles.
* Several other countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Pakistan, Romania, Taiwan, Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia, Turkey and Switzerland<!--SOAR unmanned mini-shuttle launcher from airliner--> are at various stages of development of their own small-scale launcher capabilities.

=Launch capable private entities=
* Private firm Orbital Sciences Corporation, with launches since 1982, continues very successful launches of its Minotaur, Pegasus, Taurus and Antares rocket programs.
* On 28 September 2008, late comer and private aerospace firm SpaceX successfully launched its Falcon 1 rocket into orbit. This marked the first time that a privately built liquid-fueled booster was able to reach orbit.<ref name="malik">cite web | title=SpaceX Successfully Launches Falcon 1 Rocket Into Orbit | url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/080928-spacex-falcon1-fourthtest.html | first=Tariq | last=Malik | website= | publisher=Space.com | date=28 September 2008</ref> The rocket carried a prism shaped 1.5&nbsp;m (5&nbsp;ft) long payload mass simulator that was set into orbit. The dummy satellite, known as Ratsat, will remain in orbit for between five and ten years before burning up in the atmosphere.<ref name="malik"/>

Also, it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite's transponder. It is common for Earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space, and dual-illuminate the transponder, rendering the frequency unusable. Satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively. Citation needed|date=September 2011
