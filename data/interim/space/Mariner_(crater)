Mariner Crater is a crater on Mars with a diameter of 170&nbsp;km. It is located in the Phaethontis quadrangle at  35.1° south latitude and 164.5° west longitude. Its name refers to the Mariner IV spacecraft.<ref name="GPN">cite web|title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature ! Mariner|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/3711|website=usgs.gov|publisher=International Astronomical Union|accessdate=4 March 2015</ref> In fact it is probably the best image that was taken with the Mariner IV spacecraft.  Images of this crater are shown from the Mariner 4 and Mars Reconnaissance missions.  One can compare the resolutions from the Mariner IV camera, CTX, and HiRISE.

Gullies are found in Mariner.<ref>http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004163_1375</ref><ref>U.S. department of the Interior U.S. Geological Survey, Topographic Map of the Eastern Region of Mars M 15M 0/270 2AT, 1991

Straight troughs in the south are visible in this image and in the Mariner photo.  This image was taken with CTX camera (on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter).
