The Space Shuttle program was the fourth human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished routine transportation for Earth-to-orbit crew and cargo from 1981 to 2011. Its official name, Space Transportation System (STS), was taken from a 1969 plan for Space Transportation System|a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development.<ref name=autogenerated1>cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/taskgrp.html|title=Space Task Group Report, 1969|first=Roger D.|last=Launius</ref>

The Space Shuttle—composed of an Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter launched with two reusable Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters and a disposable Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank—carried up to eight astronauts and up to Convert|50000|lb|kg|abbr=on of Payload (air and space craft)|payload into low Earth orbit (LEO). When its mission was complete, the orbiter would atmospheric reentry|re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and land like a glider (aircraft)|glider at either the Kennedy Space Center or Edwards Air Force Base.

The Shuttle is the only winged manned spacecraft to have achieved orbit and landing, and the only reusable manned space vehicle that has ever made multiple flights into orbit (the Russian shuttle Buran (spacecraft)|Buran was very similar and was designed to have the same capabilities but made only one unmanned spaceflight before it was cancelled). Its List of space shuttle missions|missions involved carrying large payloads to various orbits (including segments to be added to the International Space Station (ISS)), providing crew rotation for the space station, and performing service missions. The orbiter also recovered satellites and other payloads (e.g., from the ISS) from orbit and returned them to Earth, though its use in this capacity was rare. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years' operational life, though original selling points on the shuttles were over 150 launches and over a 15-year operational span with a 'launch per month' expected at the peak of the program, but extensive delays in the development of the International Space Station<ref name="iss-casis.org">cite web|url=http://www.iss-casis.org/About/ISSTimeline.aspx|title=International Space Station Historical Timeline</ref> never created such a peak demand for frequent flights.

Background
Various shuttle concepts had been explored since the late 1960s. The program formally commenced in 1972, becoming the sole focus of NASA's manned operations after the Apollo program|Apollo, Skylab, and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|Apollo-Soyuz programs in 1975. The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public in 1972 as a 'Space Truck' which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in low Earth orbit during the 1980s and then be replaced by a new vehicle by the early 1990s. The stalled plans for a U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station and were formally initiated in 1983 by President Ronald Reagan, but the ISS suffered from long delays, design changes and cost over-runs<ref name="iss-casis.org"/> and forced the service life of the Space Shuttle to be extended several times until 2011 when it was finally retired—serving twice as long than it was originally designed to do. In 2004, according to President George W. Bush's Vision for Space Exploration, use of the Space Shuttle was to be focused almost exclusively on completing assembly of the ISS, which was far behind schedule at that point.

The first experimental orbiter Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'' was a high-altitude glider, launched from the back of a specially modified Boeing 747, only for Approach and Landing Tests|initial atmospheric landing tests (ALT). ''Enterprises first test flight was on February 18, 1977, only five years after the Shuttle program was formally initiated; leading to the launch of the first space-worthy shuttle ''Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia'' on April 12, 1981 on STS-1. The Space Shuttle program finished with its last mission, STS-135 flown by Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'', in July 2011, retiring the final Shuttle in the fleet. The Space Shuttle program formally ended on August 31, 2011.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1108/29shannon/ |title=Breaking News &#124; Shannon to review options for deep space exploration |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date=August 29, 2011 |accessdate=17 May 2012</ref>

Conception and development
Main|Space Shuttle design process
File:North American Rockwell P333.jpg|thumb|North American Rockwell's initial shuttle design. The original, fully reusable concept used a piloted, winged booster stage, essentially a larger version of the orbiter stage.
Before the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, NASA began early studies of space shuttle designs. In 1969, President Richard Milhous Nixon|Richard Nixon formed the Space Task Group, chaired by Vice President Spiro Agnew. This group outlined ambitious post-Apollo missions centered on a large permanently manned space station, a small reusable logistics vehicle that would support it, and ultimately a manned mission to Mars. Smaller goals included a variety of space vehicles for moving spacecraft around in orbit.<ref name="decision">Hepplewhite, T.A. [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/sp4221.htm ''The Space Shuttle Decision: NASA's Search for a Reusable Space Vehicle'']. Washington, DC: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 1999.</ref>

Presenting the plans to Nixon, Agnew was told that the administration would not commit to a Mars mission, and limited activity to low Earth orbit for the immediate future.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/jason-callahan/20141003-how-richard-nixon-changed-nasa.html |title= How Richard Nixon Changed NASA |first=Jason |last=Callahan |date= October 4, 2014</ref> He was then told to select one of the two remaining proposals. After some debate between the station and the vehicle, the vehicle was chosen; suitably designed, such a spacecraft could perform some longer-duration missions and thus fill some of the goals of the station, and over the longer run, could help lower the cost of access to space and make the station less expensive.<ref name="decision"/>

The goal, as presented by NASA to Congress, was to provide a much less-expensive means of access to space that would be used by NASA, the United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense, and other commercial and scientific users.<ref>General Accounting Office. Cost Benefit Analysis Used in Support of the Space Shuttle Program. Washington, DC: General Accounting Office, 1972.</ref>

During early shuttle development there was great debate about the optimal shuttle design that best balanced capability, development cost and operating cost. Ultimately chosen was a design using a reusable winged orbiter, reusable Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters, and an expendable Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank for the orbiter's main engines.<ref name="decision"/>

The shuttle program was formally launched on January 5, 1972, when President Nixon announced that NASA would proceed with the development of a reusable space shuttle system.<ref name="decision"/> The stated goals of "transforming the space frontier...into familiar territory, easily accessible for human endeavor"<ref>cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2012/11/15/the_space_shuttle_nixon_s_aides_asked_him_to_reconsider_the_program_s_name.html |title=I Say "Space Shuttle," You Say "Space Clipper" |author=Rebecca Onion |date=November 15, 2012 |work=Slate (magazine)|Slate |publisher=The Slate Group |accessdate=25 November 2012</ref> was to be achieved by launching as many as 50 missions per year, with hopes of driving down per-mission costs.<ref name="AP July 2011">cite news|last=Borenstein|first=Seth|title=AP Science Writer|url=http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2011/07/05/space_shuttles_legacy_soaring_in_orbit_and_costs/|accessdate=5 July 2011|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=July 5, 2011|agency=Associated Press</ref>

The prime contractor for the program was North American Rockwell (later Rockwell International, now Boeing), the same company responsible for building the Apollo Command/Service Module. The contractor for the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters was Thiokol|Morton Thiokol (now part of Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems), for the external tank, Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin), and for the Space Shuttle main engines, Rocketdyne (now Aerojet Rocketdyne).<ref name="decision"/>

The first orbiter was originally planned to be named ''Constitution'', but a massive write-in campaign from fans of the ''Star Trek'' television series convinced the White House to change the name to ''Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise''.<ref name="orbiter names">Brooks, Dawn (date unknown).

The first fully functional orbiter was ''Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia'' (designated OV-102), built in Palmdale, California. It was delivered to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979, and was first launched on April 12, 1981—the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's Vostok 1|space flight—with a crew of two.

''Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger'' (OV-099) was delivered to KSC in July 1982, ''Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery'' (OV-103) in November 1983, ''Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis'' (OV-104) in April 1985 and ''Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour'' in May 1991. ''Challenger'' was originally built and used as a Structural Test Article (STA-099), but was converted to a complete orbiter when this was found to be less expensive than converting ''Enterprise'' from its Approach and Landing Test configuration into a spaceworthy vehicle.

On April 24, 1990, ''Discovery'' carried the Hubble Space Telescope into space during STS-31.

In the course of 135 missions flown, two orbiters (''Columbia'' and ''Challenger'') suffered catastrophic accidents, with the loss of all crew members, totaling 14 astronauts.

The accidents led to national level inquiries and detailed analysis of why the accidents occurred.<ref name="space.com"/> There was a significant pause where changes were made before the Shuttles returned to flight.<ref name="space.com"/> The ''Columbia'' disaster occurred in 2003, but STS took more than a year off before returning to flight in June 2005 with the STS-114 mission.<ref name="space.com"/> The previous break was between January 1986 (when the ''Challenger'' disaster occurred) and 32 months later when STS-26 was launched on September 29, 1988.<ref name="history.nasa.gov">cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter15.html|title=Return to Flight...Challenger Accident|first=John A.|last=Logsdon</ref>

The longest Shuttle mission was STS-80 lasting 17 days, 15 hours. The final flight of the Space Shuttle program was STS-135 on July 8, 2011.

Since the Shuttle's retirement in 2011, many of its original duties are performed by an assortment of government and private vessels. The European ATV Automated Transfer Vehicle supplied the ISS between 2008 and 2015. Classified military missions are being flown by the US Air Force's unmanned space plane, the Boeing X-37|X-37BCitation needed|date=June 2012. By 2012, cargo to the International Space Station was already being delivered commercially under NASA's Commercial Resupply Services by SpaceX's partially reusable SpaceX Dragon|Dragon spacecraft, followed by Orbital Sciences' Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus spacecraft in late 2013. Crew service to the ISS is currently provided by the Russian Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz while work on the Commercial Crew Development|Commercial Crew Development program proceeds; the first crewed flight of this is planned for January 27, 2019, on the SpaceX Falcon 9 with Dragon 2 crew capsule.<ref>https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2018/01/11/nasas-commercial-crew-program-target-test-flight-dates-2/</ref> For missions beyond low Earth orbit, NASA is building the Space Launch System and the Orion (spacecraft).

In the course of 135 missions flown, two orbiters were destroyed, with loss of crew totalling 14 astronauts:
* ''Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger'' – lost 73 seconds after liftoff, STS-51-L, January 28, 1986
* ''Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia'' – lost approximately 16 minutes before its expected landing, STS-107, February 1, 2003

There was also one Space Shuttle abort modes|abort-to-orbit and some fatal accidents on the ground during launch preparations.

=''Challenger'' 1986=
Close-up video footage of ''Challenger'' during its final launch on January 28, 1986 clearly show it began due to an Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|O-ring failure on the right solid rocket booster (SRB). The hot plume of gas leaking from the failed joint caused the collapse of the external tank, which then resulted in the orbiter's disintegration due to high aerodynamic stress. The accident resulted in the loss of all seven astronauts on board. ''Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour'' (OV-105) was built to replace ''Challenger'' (using structural spare parts originally intended for the other orbiters) and delivered in May 1991; it was first launched a year later.

After the loss of ''Challenger'', NASA grounded the shuttle program for over two years, making numerous safety changes recommended by the Rogers Commission Report, which included a redesign of the SRB joint that failed in the ''Challenger'' accident. Other safety changes included a new escape system for use when the orbiter was in controlled flight, improved landing gear tires and brakes, and the reintroduction of pressure suits for shuttle astronauts (these had been discontinued after STS-4; astronauts wore only coveralls and oxygen helmets from that point on until the ''Challenger'' accident). The shuttle program continued in September 1988 with the launch of ''Discovery'' on STS-26.

The accidents did not just affect the technical design of the orbiter, but also NASA.<ref name="history.nasa.gov"/>

This could be a new design eliminating the joint or a redesign of the current joint and seal. ... the Administrator of NASA should request the National Research Council to form an independent Solid Rocket Motor design oversight committee to implement the Commission's design recommendations and oversee the design effort.
Recommendation II – The Shuttle Program Structure should be reviewed. ... NASA should encourage the transition of qualified astronauts into agency management Positions.
Recommendation III – NASA and the primary shuttle contractors should review all Criticality 1, 1R, 2, and 2R items and hazard analyses.
Recommendation IV – NASA should establish an Office of Safety, Reliability and Quality Assurance to be headed by an Associate Administrator, reporting directly to the NASA Administrator.
Recommendation VI – NASA must take actions to improve landing safety. The tire, brake and nosewheel system must be improved.
Recommendation VII – Make all efforts to provide a crew escape system for use during controlled gliding flight.
Recommendation VIII – The nation's reliance on the shuttle as its principal space launch capability created a relentless pressure on NASA to increase the flight rate ... NASA must establish a flight rate that is consistent with its resources.

=''Columbia''  2003=

The shuttle program operated accident-free for seventeen years after the ''Challenger'' disaster, until Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' broke up on re-entry, killing all seven crew members, on February 1, 2003. The accident began when a piece of foam shed from the external tank struck the leading edge of the orbiter's left wing, puncturing one of the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panels that covered the wing edge and protected it during re-entry. As ''Columbia'' re-entered the atmosphere, hot gas penetrated the wing and destroyed it from the inside out, causing the orbiter to lose control and disintegrate.

After the ''Columbia'' disaster, the International Space Station operated on a skeleton crew of two for more than two years and was serviced primarily by Russian spacecraft. While the "Return to Flight" mission STS-114 in 2005 was successful, a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed. Although the debris did not strike ''Discovery'', the program was grounded once again for this reason.

The second "Return to Flight" mission, STS-121 launched on July 4, 2006, at 14:37 (EDT). Two previous launches were scrubbed because of lingering thunderstorms and high winds around the launch pad, and the launch took place despite objections from its chief engineer and safety head. A five-inch (13&nbsp;cm) crack in the foam insulation of the external tank gave cause for concern; however, the Mission Management Team gave the go for launch.<ref>Chien, Philip (June 27, 2006) [http://www.washtimes.com/national/20060626-110227-5543r.htm "NASA wants shuttle to fly despite safety misgivings."] ''The Washington Times''</ref> This mission increased the ISS crew to three. ''Discovery'' touched down successfully on July 17, 2006 at 09:14 (EDT) on Runway 15 at John F. Kennedy Space Center|Kennedy Space Center.

Following the success of STS-121, all subsequent missions were completed without major foam problems, and the construction of ISS was completed (during the STS-118 mission in August 2007, the orbiter was again struck by a foam fragment on liftoff, but this damage was minimal compared to the damage sustained by ''Columbia'').

The ''Columbia'' Accident Investigation Board, in its report, noted the reduced risk to the crew when a shuttle flew to the International Space Station (ISS), as the station could be used as a safe haven for the crew awaiting rescue in the event that damage to the orbiter on ascent made it unsafe for re-entry. The board recommended that for the remaining flights, the shuttle always orbit with the station. Prior to STS-114, NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe declared that all future flights of the shuttle would go to the ISS, precluding the possibility of executing the final Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission which had been scheduled before the ''Columbia'' accident, despite the fact that millions of dollars worth of upgrade equipment for Hubble were ready and waiting in NASA warehouses. Many dissenters, including astronauts who|date=September 2013, asked NASA management to reconsider allowing the mission, but initially the director stood firm. On October 31, 2006, NASA announced approval of the launch of ''Atlantis'' for the fifth and final shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, scheduled for August 28, 2008. However SM4/STS-125 eventually launched in May 2009.

One impact of ''Columbia'' was that future crewed launch vehicles, namely the Ares I, had a special emphasis on crew safety compared to other considerations.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.space.com/7126-dumping-nasa-ares-rocket-cost-billions.html|title=Dumping NASA's New Ares I Rocket Would Cost Billions</ref>

NASA maintains extensive, warehoused catalogs of recovered pieces from the two destroyed orbiters.

Retirement

main|Space Shuttle retirement

The Space Shuttle program was extended several times beyond its originally envisioned 15-year life span because of the delays in building the United States space station in low Earth orbit—a project which eventually evolved into the International Space Station. It was formally scheduled for mandatory retirement in 2010 in accord with the directives President George W. Bush issued on January 14, 2004 in his Vision for Space Exploration.<ref name="bushvision">cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/solarsystem/bush_vision.html|title=President Bush Offers New Vision For NASA|accessdate=January 14, 2004|publisher=nasa.gov|year=2004|author=President George W. Bush (Attributed)</ref>

A $2.5&nbsp;billion spending provision allowing NASA to fly the Space Shuttle beyond its then-scheduled retirement in 2010 passed the Congress in April 2009, although neither NASA nor the White House requested the one-year extension.<ref>Mark, Roy "Mandatory Shuttle Retirement Temporarily Postponed" (April 30, 2009) ''Green IT'', e-week.com</ref>

The final Space Shuttle launch was that of ''Atlantis'' on July 8, 2011. Although the retirement was planned and roughly in line with what was expected out of STS without further upgrades, the planned replacement for the STS, the Constellation program was cancelled the year before STS concluded. The two programs that took its place, two undetermined commercial crew vehicles and SLS with Orion needed even more time to have a new launcher. NASA has continued to fly to the station via its Roscosmos partner, who still has a functioning manned launcher, the Soyuz system. Manned launch systems have been proposed by other countries, such as the ESA's mini-shuttle Hermes (spacecraft)|Hermes launched by an Ariane rocket, which was cancelled in 1992.

Preservations
File:Space Shuttle Discovery @ Udvar Hazy.png|thumb|left|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'' at the Udvar Hazy museum
Out of the five fully functional shuttle orbiters built, three remain. ''Enterprise'', which was used for atmospheric test flights but not for orbital flight, had many parts taken out for use on the other orbiters. It was later visually restored and was on display at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center until April 19, 2012. ''Enterprise'' was moved to New York City in April 2012 to be displayed at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, whose Space Shuttle Pavilion opened on July 19, 2012.  ''Discovery'' replaced ''Enterprise'' at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. ''Atlantis'' formed part of the Space Shuttle Exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center visitor complex and has been on display there since June 29, 2013 following its refurbishment.<ref>cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/space-shuttle-atlantis-exhibit-opens-support-souvenirs-180805853.html|title=Space Shuttle Atlantis Exhibit Opens with Support from Souvenirs</ref>

On October 14, 2012, ''Endeavour'' completed an unprecedented convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on drive on city streets from Los Angeles International Airport to the California Science Center, where it has been on display in a temporary hangar since late 2012. The transport from the airport took two days and required major street closures, the removal of over 400 city trees, and extensive work to raise power lines, level the street, and temporarily remove street signs, lamp posts, and other obstacles.  Hundreds of volunteers, and fire and police personnel, helped with the transport.  Large crowds of spectators waited on the streets to see the shuttle as it passed through the city. ''Endeavour'' will be displayed permanently beginning in 2017 at the Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center (an addition to the California Science Center currently under construction), where it will be mounted in the vertical position complete with solid rocket boosters and an external tank.<ref name="casc">cite web | title=Space Shuttle Endeavour homepage | url=http://www.californiasciencecenter.org/GenInfo/Membership/Campaign/Campaign.php</ref>

Successors
During the three decades of operation, various follow-on and replacements for the STS Space Shuttle were partially developed but not finished.<ref name="ReferenceA">cite web|url=http://www.space.com/11363-nasa-space-shuttle-replacement-30-years-anniversaries.html|title=Politics played a big role in why NASA doesn't already have a new spacecraft to replace the retiring space shuttles.

One effort in the direction of space transportation was the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) program, initiated in 1994 by NASA.<ref name="spinoff.nasa.gov">cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff1996/14.html|title=Reusable Launch Vehicle</ref> This led to work on the X-33 and X-34 vehicles.<ref name="spinoff.nasa.gov"/> NASA spent about 1&nbsp;billion USD on developing the X-33 hoping for it be in operation by 2005.<ref name="spinoff.nasa.gov"/> Another program around the turn of the millennium was the Space Launch Initiative, which was a next generation launch initaive.<ref name="nasa.gov">[https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/172379main_ngltfacts.pdf]</ref>

The Space Launch Initiative program was started in 2001, and in late 2002 it was evolved into two programs, the Orbital Space Plane Program and the Next Generation Launch Technology program.<ref name="nasa.gov"/> OSP was oriented towards provided access to the International Space Station.<ref name="nasa.gov"/>

Other vehicles that would have taken over some of the Shuttles responsibilities were the HL-20 Personnel Launch System or the NASA X-38 of the Crew Return Vehicle program, which were primarily for getting people down from ISS. The X-38 was cancelled in 2002,<ref>cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/X-38-project-s-cancellation-irks-NASA-partners-2064969.php|title=X-38 project's cancellation irks NASA, partners</ref> and the HL-20 was cancelled in 1993.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceguide.net/hl_20.html|title=HL-20 – Lifting Body Spaceplane for Personnel Launch System|last=x0av6|date=August 4, 2016</ref> Several other programs in this existed such as the Station Crew Return Alternative Module (SCRAM) and Assured Crew Return Vehicle (ACRV)<ref>cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/n/nasaacrv.html|title=NASA ACRV</ref>

According to the 2004 Vision for Space Exploration, the next manned NASA program was to be Project Constellation with its Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles and the Orion Spacecraft; however, the Constellation program was never fully funded, and in early 2010 the Obama administration asked Congress to instead endorse a plan with heavy reliance on the private sector for delivering cargo and crew to LEO.

The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program began in 2006 with the purpose of creating commercially operated unmanned cargo vehicles to service the ISS.<ref>cite press release |publisher=NASA |date=August 18, 2006 |title=NASA Selects Crew and Cargo Transportation to Orbit Partners |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/aug/HQ_06295_COTS_phase_1.html |accessdate=21 November 2006</ref> The first of these vehicles, SpaceX's SpaceX Dragon|Dragon, became operational in 2012, and the second, Orbital Sciences' Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus did so in 2014.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/10/iss-partners-welcome-spacex-orbital-busy-2012/|title=ISS partners prepare to welcome SpaceX and Orbital in a busy 2012|last=Bergin|first=Chris|date=October 6, 2011|publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com (Not affiliated with NASA)|accessdate=December 13, 2011</ref>

Although the Constellation program was canceled, it has been replaced with a very similar beyond low Earth orbit program. The Orion spacecraft has been left virtually unchanged from its previous design. The planned Ares V rocket has been replaced with the smaller Space Launch System (SLS), which is planned to launch both Orion and other necessary hardware.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/sls1.html|title=NASA Announces Design for New Deep Space Exploration System|date=September 14, 2011|publisher=NASA|accessdate=April 28, 2012</ref> Exploration Flight Test 1|Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1), an unmanned test flight of the Orion spacecraft, launched on December 5, 2014 on a Delta IV Heavy rocket.<ref name=schedule>cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/02/acronyms-ascent-sls-managers-create-developmental-milestone-roadmap/|title=Acronyms to Ascent – SLS managers create development milestone roadmap|last=Bergin|first=Chris|date=February 23, 2012|publisher=NASA|accessdate=April 29, 2012</ref> Exploration Mission 1|Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) is the unmanned initial launch of the SLS, which is planned for 2019.<ref name=schedule/> Exploration Mission-2 (EM-2) is the first manned flight of Orion and SLS and is scheduled for 2023.<ref name=schedule/> EM-2 is a 10-14-day mission planned to place a crew of four into Lunar orbit.

Assets and transition plan
File:STS-135 30 mins after touchdown2.png|250px|thumb|''Atlantis'' about 30 minutes after final touchdown
The Space Shuttle program occupied over 654 facilities, used over 1.2&nbsp;million line items of equipment, and employed over 5,000 people. The total value of equipment was over $12&nbsp;billion. Shuttle-related facilities represented over a quarter of NASA's inventory. There were over 1,200 active suppliers to the program throughout the United States. NASA's transition plan had the program operating through 2010 with a transition and retirement phase lasting through 2015. During this time, the Ares I and Orion (Constellation program)|Orion as well as the Altair Lunar Lander were to be under development,<ref name="NTMP">cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/202388main_Transition_Mgmt_Plan-Final.pdf|title=NASA Transition Management Plan|last=Olson|first=John|author2=Joel Kearns |date=August 2008|work=JICB-001|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ref> although these programs have since been canceled.

in the 2010s, two major programs for human spaceflight were Commercial Crew Development and the Space Launch System with the Orion (spacecraft)|Orion capsule.<reF>[https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-17-017.pdf]</reF> Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 was, for example, used to launch a Falcon Heavy rocket.

Critiques
Main|Criticism of the Space Shuttle program
The Space Shuttle program has been criticized for failing to achieve its promised cost and utility goals, as well as design, cost, management, and safety issues.<ref>[http://www.idlewords.com/2005/08/a_rocket_to_nowhere.htm A Rocket to Nowhere], Maciej Cegłowski, Idle Words, March 8, 2005.</ref> Others have argued that the Shuttle program was a step backwards from the Apollo Program, which, while extremely dangerous, accomplished far more scientific and space exploration endeavors than the Shuttle ever could.

After both the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster and the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster, high-profile boards convened to investigate the accidents with both committees returning praise and serious critiques to the program and NASA management. Some of the most famous of the criticisms, most of management, came from Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman, in his report that followed his Rogers Commission#Role of Richard Feynman|appointment to the commission responsible for investigating the ''Challenger'' disaster.<ref name="Commission report">http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt</ref>

Support vehicles

Many other vehicles were used in support of the Space Shuttle program, mainly terrestrial transportation vehicles.

* The Crawler-Transporter carried the Mobile Launcher Platform and the Space Shuttle from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to Launch Complex&nbsp;39, originally built for Project Apollo.
* The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) were two modified Boeing 747s. Either could fly an orbiter from alternative landing sites back to the Kennedy Space Center. These aircraft were retired to the Joe Davies Heritage Airpark at the Armstrong Flight Research Center and Space Center Houston.
* A 36-wheeled transport trailer, the Orbiter Transfer System, originally built for the U.S. Air Force's launch facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California (since then converted for Delta&nbsp;IV rockets) would transport the orbiter from the landing facility to the launch pad, which allowed both "stacking" and launch without utilizing a separate VAB-style building and crawler-transporter roadway. Prior to the closing of the Vandenberg facility, orbiters were transported from the Orbiter Processing Facility|OPF to the VAB on their undercarriages, only to be raised when the orbiter was being lifted for attachment to the SRB/ET stack. The trailer allowed the transportation of the orbiter from the OPF to either the SCA Mate-Demate Device|"Mate-Demate" stand or the VAB without placing any additional stress on the undercarriage.
* The Mobile_lounge#NASA_Crew_Transport_Vehicles|Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV), a modified airport Mobile lounge|jet bridge, was used to assist astronauts to egress from the orbiter after landing. Upon entering the CTV, astronauts could take off their launch and re-entry suits then proceed to chairs and beds for medical checks before being transported back to the crew quarters in the Operations and Checkout Building. Originally built for Project Apollo.
* The Astronaut transfer van|Astrovan was used to transport astronauts from the crew quarters in the Operations and Checkout Building to the launch pad on launch day. It was also used to transport astronauts back again from the Crew Transport Vehicle at the Shuttle Landing Facility.
* The three locomotives serving the NASA Railroad, used to transport segments of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, were determined to be no longer needed for day-to-day operation at the Kennedy Space Center. In April 2015, locomotive No. 1 was sent to Natchitoches Parish Port and No. 3 sent to the Madison Railroad. Locomotive No. 2 was sent to the Gold Coast Railroad Museum in 2014.<ref>cite news|title=NASA Railroad rides into sunset|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2015/05/23/nasa-railroad-rides-sunset/27784213/|work=Florida Today</ref>
