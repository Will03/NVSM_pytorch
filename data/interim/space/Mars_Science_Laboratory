For|results and findings|Timeline of Mars Science Laboratory

The MSL mission has four scientific goals: Determine the landing site's Planetary habitability|habitability including the Water on Mars|role of water, the study of the climate of Mars|climate and the geology of Mars. It is also useful preparation for a future manned mission to Mars.

To contribute to these goals, MSL has eight main scientific objectives:<ref>cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/science/objectives/ |title=Objectives - Mars Science Laboratory |first=JPL, |last=NASA |publisher=</ref>
;Biological:
* (1) Determine the nature and inventory of Organic compound|organic carbon compounds
* (2) Investigate the chemical CHON|building blocks of life (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur)
* (3) Identify features that may represent the effects of biological processes (biosignatures)

;Geological and geochemical:
* (4) Investigate the chemical, Isotope|isotopic, and mineralogical composition of the Martian surface and near-surface geological materials
* (5) Interpret the processes that have formed and Pedology (soil study)|modified rocks and soils

;Planetary process:
* (6) Assess long-timescale (i.e., 4-billion-year) Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmospheric evolution processes
* (7) Determine present state, distribution, and Water on Mars|cycling of water and carbon dioxide

;Surface radiation:
* (8) Characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation, including cosmic ray|cosmic radiation, solar particle events and Neutron#High-energy neutrons|secondary neutrons. As part of its exploration, it also measured the radiation exposure in the interior of the spacecraft as it traveled to Mars, and it is continuing radiation measurements as it explores the surface of Mars. This data would be important for a future Manned mission to Mars|manned mission.<ref name="double"/>

About one year into the surface mission, and having assessed that ancient Mars could have been hospitable to microbial life, the MSL mission objectives evolved to developing predictive models for the preservation process of organic compounds and biomolecules; a branch of paleontology called taphonomy.<ref name="Science 01-24-2014">cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/386.full |title=Habitability, Taphonomy, and the Search for Organic Carbon on Mars |journal=Science (journal)|Science |first=John P. |last=Grotzinger |volume=343 |issue=6169 |pages=386–87 |date=January 24, 2014 |doi=10.1126/science.1249944 |pmid=24458635 |bibcode=2014Sci...343..386G</ref>

The spacecraft flight system had a mass at launch of convert|3893|kg|lb|abbr=on, consisting of an Earth-Mars fueled cruise (flight)|cruise stage (convert|539|kg|lb|abbr=on), the entry-descent-landing (EDL) system (convert|2401|kg|lb|abbr=on including convert|390|kg|lb|abbr=on of landing propellant), and a convert|899|kg|lb|abbr=on mobile rover with an integrated instrument package.<ref name="Mars Science Laboratory Landing Press Kit"/><ref name="DESCANSO"/>

The MSL spacecraft includes spaceflight-specific instruments, in addition to utilizing one of the rover instruments — Radiation assessment detector (RAD) — during the spaceflight transit to Mars.
* MSL EDL Instrument (MEDLI): The MEDLI project's main objective is to measure aerothermal environments, sub-surface heat shield material response, vehicle orientation, and atmospheric density.<ref name="MSLMEDLIProject"/> The MEDLI instrumentation suite was installed in the heatshield of the MSL entry vehicle. The acquired data will support future Mars missions by providing measured atmospheric data to validate Atmosphere of Mars|Mars atmosphere models and clarify the lander design margins on future Mars missions. MEDLI instrumentation consists of three main subsystems: MEDLI Integrated Sensor Plugs (MISP), Mars Entry Atmospheric Data System (MEADS) and the Sensor Support Electronics (SSE).

main|Curiosity (rover)#Specifications
''Curiosity'' rover has a mass of convert|899|kg|lb|abbr=on, can travel up to convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on per hour on its six-wheeled rocker-bogie system, is powered by a multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG), and communicates in both X band and UHF bands.
* Computers: The two identical on-board rover computers, called "Rover Compute Element" (RCE), contain Radiation hardening|radiation-hardened memory to tolerate the extreme radiation from space and to safeguard against power-off cycles. Each computer's memory includes 256&nbsp;Kilobyte|KB of EEPROM, 256&nbsp;Megabyte|MB of Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM, and 2&nbsp;Gigabyte|GB of flash memory.<ref name="Brains"/> This compares to 3&nbsp;MB of EEPROM, 128&nbsp;MB of DRAM, and 256&nbsp;MB of flash memory used in the Mars Exploration Rovers.<ref name="ieeecomputer"/>

:The RCE computers use the RAD750 Central processing unit|CPU (a successor to the IBM RAD6000|RAD6000 CPU used in the Mars Exploration Rovers) operating at 200&nbsp;MHz.<ref name="BAE Systems Computers to Manage Data Processing and Command For Upcoming Satellite Missions"/><ref name="E&ISNow&nbsp;— Media gets closer look at Manassas"/><ref name="cpuspeed"/> The RAD750 CPU is capable of up to 400&nbsp;Instructions per second#Million instructions per second|MIPS, while the RAD6000 CPU is capable of up to 35&nbsp;MIPS.<ref name="RAD750brochure"/><ref name="RAD6000brochure"/> Of the two on-board computers, one is configured as backup, and will take over in the event of problems with the main computer.<ref name="Brains"/>

:The rover has an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that provides 3-axis information on its position, which is used in rover navigation.<ref name="Brains"/> The rover's computers are constantly self-monitoring to keep the rover operational, such as by regulating the rover's temperature.<ref name="Brains"/> Activities such as taking pictures, driving, and operating the instruments are performed in a command sequence that is sent from the flight team to the rover.<ref name="Brains"/>

The rover's computers function on VxWorks, a real-time operating system from Wind River Systems.<ref>cite news |title=Wind River's VxWorks Powers Mars Science Laboratory Rover, Curiosity |date=August 6, 2012 |url=http://www.virtual-strategy.com/2012/08/06/wind-river%E2%80%99s-vxworks-powers-mars-science-laboratory-rover-curiosity |work=Virtual Strategy Magazine |accessdate=August 20, 2012</ref> During the trip to Mars, VxWorks ran applications  dedicated to the navigation and guidance phase of the mission, and also had a pre-programmed software sequence for handling the complexity of the entry-descent-landing. Once landed, the applications were replaced with software for driving on the surface and performing scientific activities.<ref name="BrainTransplant"/><ref name="CuriosityVxWorks"/><ref name="cnn.com">cite news |title=Impressive' Curiosity landing only 1.5 miles off, NASA says |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/10/us/mars-curiosity/index.html?eref=mrss_igoogle_cnn |accessdate=August 10, 2012</ref>

The Morse code pattern (for "Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL") is represented by small (dot) and large (dash) holes in three horizontal lines on the wheels. The code on each line is read from right to left.
* Communications: ''Curiosity'' is equipped with several means of communication, for redundancy. An X band Small Deep Space Transponder for communication directly to Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network<ref>Cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/communicationwithearth/ |title=Mars Science Laboratory, Communications With Earth |publisher=JPL</ref> and a ultra high frequency|UHF Electra (radio)|Electra-Lite software-defined radio for communicating with Mars orbiters.<ref name="DESCANSO"/>Rp|46  The X-band system has one radio, with a 15&nbsp;W power amplifier, and two antennas: a low-gain omnidirectional antenna that can communicate with Earth at very low data rates (15&nbsp;bit/s at maximum range), regardless of rover orientation, and a high-gain antenna that can communicate at speeds up to 32&nbsp;kbit/s, but must be aimed. The UHF system has two radios (approximately 9&nbsp;W transmit power<ref name="DESCANSO"/>Rp|81), sharing one omnidirectional antenna. This can communicate with the ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'' (MRO) and ''2001 Mars Odyssey'' orbiter (ODY) at speeds up to 2&nbsp;Mbit/s and 256&nbsp;kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is only able to communicate with ''Curiosity'' for about 8 minutes per day.<ref name="Curiosity's data communication with Earth"/>  The orbiters have larger antennas and more powerful radios, and can relay data to Earth faster than the rover could do directly. Therefore, most of the data returned by ''Curiosity'' (MSL), is via the UHF relay links with MRO and ODY. The data return via the communication infrastructure as implemented at MSL, and observed during the first 10 days was approximately 31 megabytes per day.

:Typically 225&nbsp;kbit/day of commands are transmitted to the rover directly from Earth, at a data rate of 1–2&nbsp;kbit/s, during a 15-minute (900 second) transmit window, while the larger volumes of data collected by the rover are returned via satellite relay.<ref name="DESCANSO"/>Rp|46  The one-way communication delay with Earth varies from 4 to 22 minutes, depending on the planets' relative positions, with 12.5 minutes being the average.<ref name="UT-20120817">cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/14824/distance-from-earth-to-mars/ |title=Distance from Earth to Mars |first=Fraser |last=Cain |date=August 10, 2012 |publisher=Universe Today |accessdate=August 17, 2012</ref>

:At landing, telemetry was monitored by the ''2001 Mars Odyssey'' orbiter, ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'' and ESA's ''Mars Express''. Odyssey is capable of relaying UHF telemetry back to Earth in real time. The relay time varies with the distance between the two planets and took 13:46 minutes at the time of landing.<ref name="WA-20120806" /><ref name="spaceflightnow" />
* Mobility systems:  ''Curiosity'' is equipped with six wheels in a rocker-bogie suspension, which also served as landing gear for the vehicle, unlike its smaller predecessors.<ref name="new wheels"/><ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/building_curiosity.html |title=Watch NASA's Next Mars Rover Being Built Via Live 'Curiosity Cam' |accessdate=August 16, 2012 |date=September 13, 2011 |work=NASA</ref> The wheels are significantly larger (convert|50|cm|in|sp=us diameter) than those used on previous rovers. Each wheel has cleats and is independently actuated and geared, providing for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over rocks. The four corner wheels can be independently steered, allowing the vehicle to turn in place as well as execute arcing turns.<ref name="DESCANSO"/> Each wheel has a pattern that helps it maintain traction and leaves patterned tracks in the sandy surface of Mars. That pattern is used by on-board cameras to judge the distance traveled. The pattern itself is Morse code for "Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL" (•−−− •−−• •−••).<ref name="aarlmorse"/> Based on the center of mass, the vehicle can withstand a tilt of at least 50 degrees in any direction without overturning, but automatic sensors will limit the rover from exceeding 30-degree tilts.<ref name="DESCANSO"/>

The general analysis strategy begins with high resolution cameras to look for features of interest. If a particular surface is of interest, ''Curiosity'' can vaporize a small portion of it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature to query the rock's elemental composition. If that signature intrigues, the rover will use its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectrometer to take a closer look. If the specimen warrants further analysis, ''Curiosity'' can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the Sample Analysis at Mars|SAM or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover.<ref name="Gale Crater: Geological 'sweet shop' awaits Mars rover"/><ref name="MSLSAM"/><ref name="nasa5"/>

File:MSL-Cruise Stage Test.jpg|thumb|MSL's cruise stage on Earth
The Mars Science Laboratory was recommended by United States National Research Council Decadal Survey committee as the top priority middle-class Mars mission in 2003.<ref>Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/10432/new-frontiers-in-the-solar-system-an-integrated-exploration-strategy|title=New Frontiers in the Solar System: An Integrated Exploration Strategy|last=Council|first=National Research|date=2002-07-11|language=en</ref> NASA called for proposals for the rover's scientific instruments in April 2004,<ref name="Stathopoulos"/> and eight proposals were selected on December 14 of that year.<ref name=Stathopoulos/> Testing and design of components also began in late 2004, including Aerojet's designing of a monopropellant engine with the ability to throttle from 15–100 percent thrust with a fixed propellant inlet pressure.<ref name=Stathopoulos/>

= Cost overruns, delays, and launch =
By November 2008 most hardware and software development was complete, and testing continued.<ref name="usra"/> At this point, cost overruns were approximately $400 million. In the attempts to meet the launch date, several instruments and a cache for samples were removed and other instruments and cameras were simplified to simplify testing and integration of the rover.<ref name=Air&Space/><ref name="universetoday"/> The next month, NASA delayed the launch to late 2011 because of inadequate testing time.<ref name="Next NASA Mars Mission Rescheduled For 2011"/><ref name="Mars Science Laboratory: the budgetary reasons behind its delay"/><ref name="thespacereview"/> Eventually the costs for developing the rover reached $2.47 billion, that for a rover that initially had been classified as a medium-cost mission with a maximum budget of $650 million, yet NASA still had to ask for an additional $82 million to meet the planned November launch. As of 2012, the project suffered an 84 percent overrun.<ref>Cite web|url=https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/gao-slams-jwst-msl-cost-overruns/|title=GAO Slams JWST, MSL Cost Overruns|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-30</ref>

MSL launched on an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral on November 26, 2011.<ref name="nasa3"/> On January 11, 2012, the spacecraft successfully refined its trajectory with a three-hour series of thruster-engine firings, advancing the rover's landing time by about 14 hours. When MSL was launched, the program's director was Doug McCuistion of NASA's Planetary Science Division.<ref name="Doug McCuistion"/>

Over 60 landing sites were evaluated, and by July 2011 Gale crater was chosen. A primary goal when selecting the landing site was to identify a particular geologic environment, or set of environments, that would support microbial life. Planners looked for a site that could contribute to a wide variety of possible science objectives. They preferred a landing site with both morphologic and mineralogical evidence for past water. Furthermore, a site with spectra indicating multiple Mineral hydration|hydrated minerals was preferred; clay minerals and sulfate salts would constitute a rich site. Hematite, other iron oxides, sulfate minerals, silicate minerals, Silicon dioxide|silica, and possibly chloride minerals were suggested as possible substrates for Fossil#Types of preservation|fossil preservation.

This capability helped remove some of the uncertainties of landing hazards that might be present in larger landing ellipses.<ref>cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/insituexploration/edl/guidedentry/ |title=MSL – Guided Entry |accessdate=August 8, 2012 |year=2011 |work=JPL |publisher=NASA</ref> Steering was achieved by the combined use of thrusters and ejectable balance masses.<ref name='Guided entry'>cite journal |title=The RCS Attitude Controller for the Exo-Atmospheric And Guided Entry Phases of the Mars Science Laboratory |journal=Planetary Probe |first=Paul B. |last=Brugarolas |first2=A. Miguel |last2=San Martin |first3=Edward C. |last3=Wong |id= |url=http://www.planetaryprobe.eu/IPPW7/proceedings/IPPW7%20Proceedings/Papers/Session5/p453.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 8, 2012</ref> The ejectable balance masses shift the capsule center of mass enabling generation of a Lift (force)|lift vector during the atmospheric phase. A navigation computer integrated the measurements to estimate the position and Attitude control (spacecraft)|attitude of the capsule that generated automated torque commands. This was the first planetary mission to use precision landing techniques.

The rover was folded up within an aeroshell that protected it during the travel through space and during the atmospheric entry at Mars. Ten minutes before atmospheric entry the aeroshell separated from the cruise stage that provided power, communications and propulsion during the long flight to Mars. One minute after separation from the cruise stage thrusters on the aeroshell fired to cancel out the spacecraft's 2-rpm rotation and achieved an orientation with the heat shield facing Mars in preparation for Atmospheric entry.<ref name="spaceflightnow.com_1"/> The heat shield is made of phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA). The convert|4.5|m|abbr=on diameter heat shield, which is the largest heat shield ever flown in space,<ref name="nasa8"/> reduced the velocity of the spacecraft by Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablation against the Martian atmosphere, from the atmospheric interface velocity of approximately convert|5.8|km/s|abbr=on down to approximately convert|470|m/s|abbr=on, where parachute deployment was possible about four minutes later. One minute and 15 seconds after entry the heat shield experienced peak temperatures of up to convert|2090|C|F|abbr=on as atmospheric pressure converted kinetic energy into heat. Ten seconds after peak heating, that deceleration peaked out at 15 g-force|g.<ref name="spaceflightnow.com_1"/>

Much of the reduction of the landing precision error was accomplished by an entry guidance algorithm, derived from the algorithm used for guidance of the Apollo Command Modules returning to Earth in the Apollo program.<ref name="spaceflightnow.com_1"/> This guidance uses the lifting force experienced by the aeroshell to "fly out" any detected error in range and thereby arrive at the targeted landing site. In order for the aeroshell to have lift, its center of mass is offset from the axial centerline that results in an off-center trim angle in atmospheric flight. This is accomplished by a series of ejectable ballast masses consisting of two convert|75|kg|lbs|abbr=on tungsten weights that were jettisoned minutes before atmospheric entry.<ref name="spaceflightnow.com_1"/> The lift vector was controlled by four sets of two reaction control system (RCS) thrusters that produced approximately convert|500|N|lbf|abbr=on of thrust per pair. This ability to change the pointing of the direction of lift allowed the spacecraft to react to the ambient environment, and steer toward the landing zone. Prior to parachute deployment the entry vehicle ejected more ballast mass consisting of six convert|25|kg|lbs|abbr=on tungsten weights such that the center of gravity offset was removed.<ref name="spaceflightnow.com_1"/>

File:MRO sees Curiosity landing.jpg|thumb|NASA's ''Curiosity'' rover and its parachute were spotted by NASA's ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'' as the probe descended to the surface. August 6, 2012.
When the entry phase was complete and the capsule slowed to about convert|470|m/s|abbr=on at about convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on altitude, the supersonic parachute deployed,<ref name="EntryDescentLanding"/> as was done by previous landers such as Viking program|Viking, Mars Pathfinder and the Mars Exploration Rovers. The parachute has 80 suspension lines, is over convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on long, and is about convert|16|m|ft|abbr=on in diameter.<ref name="ParaTest"/> Capable of being deployed at Mach 2.2, the parachute can generate up to convert|289|kN|lbf|abbr=on of drag (physics)|drag force in the Martian atmosphere.<ref name="ParaTest"/> After the parachute was deployed, the heat shield separated and fell away. A camera beneath the rover acquired about 5 frames per second (with resolution of 1600×1200 pixels) below convert|3.7|km|mi|abbr=on during a period of about 2 minutes until the rover sensors confirmed successful landing.<ref name="Mars Descent Imager (MARDI)"/> The ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'' team were able to acquire an image of the MSL descending under the parachute.<ref name="planetary"/>

Meanwhile, the rover transformed from its stowed flight configuration to a landing configuration while being lowered beneath the descent stage by the "sky crane" system.

File:593484main pia14839 full Curiosity's Sky Crane Maneuver, Artist's Concept.jpg|thumb|Artist's conceptIon of ''Curiosity'' being lowered from the rocket-powered descent stage.

For several reasons, a different landing system was chosen for MSL compared to previous Mars landers and rovers. ''Curiosity'' was considered too heavy to use the airbag landing system as used on the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rovers. A legged lander approach would have caused several design problems.<ref name="spaceflightnow.com_1"/> It would have needed to have engines high enough above the ground when landing not to form a dust cloud that could damage the rover's instruments. This would have required long landing legs that would need to have significant width to keep the center of gravity low. A legged lander would have also required ramps so the rover could drive down to the surface, which would have incurred extra risk to the mission on the chance rocks or tilt would prevent ''Curiosity'' from being able to drive off the lander successfully. Faced with these challenges, the MSL engineers came up with a novel alternative solution: the sky crane.<ref name="spaceflightnow.com_1"/> The sky crane system lowered the rover with a convert|7.6|m|foot|abbr=on<ref name="spaceflightnow.com_1"/> tether to a soft landing—wheels down—on the surface of Mars.<ref name="EntryDescentLanding"/><ref name="scientificamerican"/><ref name="Mars rover lands on Xbox Live"/> This system consists of a bridle lowering the rover on three nylon tethers and an electrical cable carrying information and power between the descent stage and rover. As the support and data cables unreeled, the rover's six motorized wheels snapped into position. At roughly convert|7.5|m|abbr=on below the descent stage the sky crane system slowed to a halt and the rover touched down. After the rover touched down, it waited two seconds to confirm that it was on solid ground by detecting the weight on the wheels and fired several pyrotechnic fastener|pyros (small explosive devices) activating cable cutters on the bridle and umbilical cords to free itself from the descent stage. The descent stage then flew away to a crash landing  convert|650|m|foot|abbr=on away.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/msl20120807.html |title=Orbiter Images NASA's Martian Landscape Additions |accessdate=August 9, 2012 |date=August 8, 2012 |work=NASA</ref> The sky crane concept had never been used in missions before.<ref name="youtube"/>

That was in August 2006—and the Congress-approved figure was $1.63 billion. ... With this request, the MSL budget had reached $1.9 billion. ... NASA HQ requested JPL prepare an assessment of costs to complete the construction of MSL by the next launch opportunity (in October 2011). This figure came in around $300 million, and NASA HQ has estimated this will translate to at least $400 million (assuming reserves will be required), to launch MSL and operate it on the surface of Mars from 2012 through 2014.</ref>
