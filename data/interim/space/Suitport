A suitport or suitlock is an alternative technology to an airlock, designed for use in hazardous environments and in human spaceflight, especially planetary surface exploration. Suitports present advantages over traditional airlocks in terms of mass, volume, and ability to mitigate contamination by—and of—the local environment.

Operation
In a suitport system, a rear-entry space suit is attached and sealed against the outside of a spacecraft, space habitat, or pressurized Rover (space exploration)|rover, facing outward. To begin an extra-vehicular activity (EVA), an astronaut in shirt-sleeve environment|shirt-sleeves first enters the suit feet-first from inside the pressurized environment, and closes and seals the space suit Primary Life Support System|backpack and the vehicle's hatch (which seals to the backpack for dust containment). The astronaut then unseals and separates the suit from the vehicle, and is ready to perform an EVA.<ref name = culbertson>cite web

To re-enter the vehicle, the astronaut backs up to the suitport and seals the suit to the vehicle, before opening the hatch and backpack and transferring back into the vehicle. If the vehicle and suit do not operate at the same pressure, it will be necessary to equalize the two pressures before the hatch can be opened.

Advantages and disadvantages
=Advantages=
Suitports carry three major advantages over traditional airlocks.  First, the mass and volume required for a suitport is significantly less than that required for an airlock.  Launch mass is at a premium in modern chemical rocket-powered launch vehicles, at an estimated cost of United States dollar|US$60,000 per kilogram delivered to the lunar surface.<ref>cite conference

Secondly, suitports can eliminate or minimize the problem of dust migration. During the Apollo program, it was discovered that the lunar soil is Electric charge|electrically charged, and adheres readily to any surface with which it comes into contact, a problem magnified by the sharp, barb-like shapes of the dust particles.<ref name=space>cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-06-15 </ref>  Lunar dust may be harmful in several ways:

*The abrasive nature of the dust particles may rub and wear down surfaces through friction.
*The dust may damage coatings used on gaskets, optical lenses, solar panels, windows, and wiring.
*The dust may cause damage to an astronaut's lungs as well as nervous and circulatory system|cardiovascular systems, leading to conditions such as pneumoconiosis.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2006/pdf/2193.pdf  |title=Micro-Morphology And Toxicological Effects Of Lunar Dust |accessdate=2007-03-08 |last=Park |first=J.S. |authorlink= |author2=Y.

Taylor  |work= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVII (2006)-  |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=The particle size distribution of the lunar dust from Apollo 17 sample 77051 has been determined using SEM imaging analysis. The size-distribution data features an approximate Gaussian distribution with a single mode at around 300-nm. The reactivation surface area of highly porous “Swiss-cheese” particles is about 26% higher than a sphere. The morphologies of dust grains have been classified based upon their four types: 1) spherical; 2) angular blocks; 3) glass shards; and 4) irregular (ropey or Swiss-cheese). These data will assist the medical researchers in their studies of the toxicological effects of inhalation of lunar dust by humans.</ref><ref>cite news |first=Kelly|last=Young |author= |title=Lint rollers may collect dangerous Moon dust |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11326-lint-rollers-may-collect-dangerous-moon-dust.html |work= |publisher=New Scientist |id= |pages= |page= |date=6 March 2007  |accessdate=2008-02-17  |language= |quote=While hailed as a potential source of oxygen and metals, Moon dust is a concern because doctors fear the smallest grains could lodge in astronauts' lungs, possibly causing long-term health effects.</ref>

During the Apollo missions, the astronauts donned their space suits inside the Apollo Lunar Module cabin, which was then depressurized to allow them to exit the vehicle.  Upon the end of EVA, the astronauts would re-enter the cabin in their suits, bringing with them a great deal of dust which had adhered to the suits. Several astronauts reported a "gunpowder" smell and respiratory and/or eye irritation upon opening their helmets and being exposed to the dust.<ref name=space/>

When the suit is attached to the vehicle, any dust which may have adhered to the backpack of the suit is sealed between the outside of the backpack and the vehicle-side hatch. Any dust on the suit that is not on the backpack remains sealed outside the vehicle. Likewise, the suitport prevents contamination of the external environment by microbes carried by the astronaut.

Additionally, the suitports significantly reduce the ingress and egress time, and virtually remove the need of pumpdown of the airlock, which normally is either associated with air loss, or requires heavy and complex pumping machinery as the only space that needs to be pressurized is the area between the vehicle hatch and the life-support backpack, and even that only in case of need for repairs, decontamination and refitting of the suit.<ref name = culbertson /><ref name = NASATechBriefs />

=Disadvantages=
Disadvantages of suitports include the additional mass of the interface on the rear of the space suit which may be more than 4.5 kg, and increased mechanical complexity, potentially reducing the overall reliability of the EVA system.<ref name="autogenerated2003">cite book| last1=Abramov|first1=Isaak P.|last2=Skoog|first2=Ingemar A.|title=Russian Spacesuits|date=23 November 2003|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|accessdate=17 February 2003</ref> According to NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, disadvantages of suitports also include:
* A lower technology readiness level (TRL) than airlocks
* Greater difficulty for incapacitated crewmembers to ingress 
* Possible requirement for suit donning at convert|8|psi|atm with relaxed man-loads 
* Likely requirement for some back-mounted Primary Life Support System components, introducing challenges for achieving an optimal center of mass.<ref>cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/190083main_AIAA_ESMD_finalSPACE2007.pdf |title='Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, Lunar Architecture Update, AIAA Space 2007’ |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=December 24, 2012 </ref>
