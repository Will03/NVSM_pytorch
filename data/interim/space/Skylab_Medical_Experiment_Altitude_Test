The Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test, or SMEAT, was a 56-day simulation of an United States|American Skylab space mission from July 26&ndash;September 19, 1972 at NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas. The astronauts in the test were Bob Crippen, Karol Bobko, and William E. Thornton|William Thornton, who simulated space experiments, housekeeping and leisure activities in a hypobaric chamber. SMEAT provided a baseline for the in-orbit portion of biomedical experiments on Skylab.<ref>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19740003741]</ref>

One of the benefits of SMEAT was discovering flaws in the urine handling system of Skylab, which allowed the problem to be fixed.<ref>Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4208/ch8.htm|title=ch8|website=history.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-10-06</ref> The Skylab toilet went on to be widely praised by astronauts after the orbital missions.<ref>Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4208/ch8.htm|title=ch8|website=history.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-10-06</ref>

SMEAT's main objective was to evaluate equipment and procedures proposed for use during the Skylab missions. NASA also wanted to obtain a baseline of physiological data for crewmembers confined in a test chamber to compare to the orbiting crews in Skylab living in zero-G.  The crew was subjected to a pressure of fraction|3 bar (unit)|bar and 70% oxygen level.<ref>cite book|title=Homesteading Space: The Skylab Story|date=2008|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-3639-4|author=David Hitt|author2=Owen K.
