A space suit is a garment worn to keep a human alive in the harsh environment of outer space, Vacuum (outer space)|vacuum and temperature extremes. Space suits are often worn inside spacecraft as a safety precaution in case of loss of cabin pressure, and are necessary for extravehicular activity (EVA), work done outside spacecraft. Space suits have been worn for such work in Earth orbit, on the surface of the Moon, and en route back to Earth from the Moon. Modern space suits augment the basic pressure garment with a complex system of equipment and environmental systems designed to keep the wearer comfortable, and to minimize the effort required to bend the limbs, resisting a soft pressure garment's natural tendency to stiffen against the vacuum. A self-contained oxygen supply and environmental control system is frequently employed to allow complete freedom of movement, independent of the spacecraft.

Three types of space suits exist for different purposes: IVA (intravehicular activity), EVA (extravehicular activity), and IEVA (intra/extravehicular activity). IVA suits are meant to be worn inside a pressurized spacecraft, and are therefore lighter and more comfortable. IEVA suits are meant for use inside and outside the spacecraft, such as the Gemini space suit|Gemini G4C suit. They include more protection from the harsh conditions of space, such as protection from micrometeorites and extreme temperature change. EVA suits, such as the Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU, are used outside spacecraft, for either planetary exploration or spacewalks. They must protect the wearer against all conditions of space, as well as provide mobility and functionality.<ref name=thomas/>

Some of these requirements also apply to pressure suits worn for other specialized tasks, such as high-altitude reconnaissance flight. At altitudes above the Armstrong limit, around convert|19000|m|ft|abbr=on, water boils at body temperature and pressurized suits are needed.

The first full-pressure suits for use at extreme altitudes were designed by individual inventors as early as the 1930s. The first space suit worn by a human in space was the Soviet Union|Soviet SK-1 spacesuit|SK-1 suit worn by Yuri Gagarin in 1961.

 Requirements 
Image:STS-116 spacewalk 1.jpg|thumb|Space suits being used to work on the International Space Station.

A space suit must perform several functions to allow its occupant to work safely and comfortably, inside or outside a spacecraft. It must provide:
* A stable internal pressure. This can be less than earth's atmosphere, as there is usually no need for the space suit to carry nitrogen (which comprises about 78% of earth's atmosphere and is not used by the body). Lower pressure allows for greater mobility, but requires the suit occupant to breathe pure oxygen for a time before going into this lower pressure, to avoid decompression sickness.
* Mobility. Movement is typically opposed by the pressure of the suit; mobility is achieved by careful joint design. See the ''Space suit#Theories of design|Theories of space suit design'' section.
* Supply of breathable oxygen and elimination of carbon dioxide; these gases are exchanged with the spacecraft or a Primary Life Support System|Portable Life Support System (PLSS)
* Temperature regulation. Unlike on Earth, where heat can be transferred by convection to the atmosphere, in space, heat can be lost only by thermal radiation or by heat conduction|conduction to objects in physical contact with the exterior of the suit. Since the temperature on the outside of the suit varies greatly between sunlight and shadow, the suit is heavily insulated, and air temperature is maintained at a comfortable level.
* A communication system, with external electrical connection to the spacecraft or PLSS
* Means of collecting and containing solid and liquid bodily waste (such as a Maximum Absorbency Garment)

Fisher, and Shannon W. LucidmdashThe first six female astronauts of the United States stand with a Personal Rescue Enclosure, a spherical life support ball for emergency transfer of people in space
Advanced suits better regulate the astronaut's temperature with a Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) in contact with the astronaut's skin, from which the heat is dumped into space through an external radiator in the PLSS.

Additional requirements for EVA include:
* Shielding against ultraviolet radiation
* Limited shielding against particle radiation
* Means to maneuver, dock, release, and/or tether onto a spacecraft
* Protection against small micrometeoroids, some traveling at up to 27,000 kilometers per hour, provided by a puncture-resistant Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment, which is the outermost layer of the suit. Experience has shown the greatest chance of exposure occurs near the gravitational field of a moon or planet, so these were first employed on the Apollo program|Apollo lunar EVA suits (see ''Space suit#United States suit models|United States suit models'' below).

As part of astronautical hygiene control (i.e., protecting astronauts from extremes of temperature, radiation, etc.), a space suit is essential for extravehicular activity. The Apollo/Skylab A7L suit included eleven layers in all: an inner liner, a LCVG, a pressure bladder, a restraint layer, another liner, and a Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment consisting of five aluminized insulation layers and an external layer of white Ortho-Fabric. This space suit is capable of protecting the astronaut from temperatures ranging from convert|-156|°C to convert|121|°C.Citation needed|date=December 2010

During exploration of the moon or Mars, there will be the potential for lunar/Martian dust to be retained on the space suit. When the space suit is removed on return to the spacecraft, there will be the potential for the dust to contaminate surfaces and increase the risks of inhalation and skin exposure. Astronautical hygienists are testing materials with reduced dust retention times and the potential to control the dust exposure risks during planetary exploration. Novel ingress/egress approaches, such as suitports, are being explored as well.

In NASA space suits, communications are provided via a cap worn over the head, which includes earphones and a microphone. Due to the coloration of the version used for Apollo and Skylab, which resembled the coloration of the comic strip character Snoopy, these caps became known as "Snoopy caps."

= Operating pressure =
Image:Prebreathe.jpg|thumb|200 px|Astronaut Steven G. MacLean pre-breathes prior to an EVA.
Generally, to supply enough oxygen for Respiratory system|respiration, a space suit using pure oxygen must have a pressure of about convert|32.4|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on, equal to the convert|20.7|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on partial pressure of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere at sea level, plus convert|5.3|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on chem|CO|2 and convert|6.3|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on|lk=on water vapor pressure, both of which must be subtracted from the Pulmonary gas pressures|alveolar pressure to get alveolar oxygen partial pressure in 100% oxygen atmospheres, by the alveolar gas equation.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.globalrph.com/martin_4_most2.htm |title=The Four Most Important Equations In Clinical Practice |last=Martin |first=Lawrence |website=GlobalRPh |publisher=David McAuley |accessdate=June 19, 2013</ref> The latter two figures add to convert|11.6|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on, which is why many modern space suits do not use convert|20.7|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on, but convert|32.4|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on (this is a slight overcorrection, as alveolar partial pressures at sea level are slightly less than the former). In space suits that use 20.7&nbsp;kPa, the astronaut gets only 20.7&nbsp;kPa − 11.7&nbsp;kPa = convert|9.0|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on of oxygen, which is about the alveolar oxygen partial pressure attained at an altitude of convert|1860|m|ft|abbr=on above sea level. This is about 78% of normal partial pressure of oxygen at sea level,citation needed|date=March 2014 about the same as pressure in a commercial passenger jet aircraft, and is the realistic lower limit for safe ordinary space suit pressurization which allows reasonable capacity for work.

When space suits below a specific operating pressure are used from craft that are pressurized to normal atmospheric pressure (such as the Space Shuttle), this requires astronauts to "pre-breathe" (meaning pre-breathe pure oxygen for a period) before donning their suits and depressurizing in the air lock. This procedure purges the body of dissolved nitrogen, so as to avoid decompression sickness due to rapid depressurization from a nitrogen-containing atmosphere.

=Physical effects of unprotected space exposure=
Main|Space exposure
refimprove section|date=December 2014

The human body can briefly survive the hard vacuum of space unprotected,<ref name="Bellows2006">cite web |url=http://www.damninteresting.com/outer-space-exposure |title=Outer Space Exposure |last=Bellows |first=Alan |date=November 27, 2006 |website=Damn Interesting |id=Article #237 |accessdate=June 19, 2013</ref> despite contrary depictions in some popular science fiction. Human flesh expands to about twice its size in such conditions, giving the visual effect of a body builder rather than an overfilled balloon. Consciousness is retained for up to 15 seconds as the effects of Hypoxia (medical)|oxygen starvation set in. No snap freeze effect occurs because all heat must be lost through thermal radiation or the evaporation of liquids, and the blood does not boil because it remains pressurized within the body.

In space, there are many different highly energized subatomic particle|subatomic protons that will expose the body to extreme radiation. Although these compounds are minimal in amount, their high energy is liable to disrupt essential physical and chemical processes in the body, such as altering DNA or causing cancers. Exposure to radiation can create problems via two methods: the particles can react with water in the human body to produce free radicals that break DNA molecules apart, or by directly breaking the DNA molecules.<ref name=thomas>cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Kenneth S.|last2=McMann|first2=Harold J.|title=U.S. Spacesuits|date=23 November 2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|accessdate=17 February 2015</ref><ref>cite web|title=Space Radiation Analysis Group|url=http://srag.jsc.nasa.gov/Index.cfm|website=NASA, Johnson Space Center|publisher=NASA|accessdate=16 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218045538/http://srag.jsc.nasa.gov/Index.cfm|archivedate=February 18, 2015|df=mdy-all</ref>

Temperature in space can vary extremely depending on where the sun is. Temperatures from solar radiation can reach up to convert|250|°F and lower down to convert|-387|°F|0. Because of this, space suits must provide proper insulation and cooling.<ref name=thomas/>

The vacuum in space creates zero pressure, causing the gases and processes in the body to expand. In order to prevent chemical processes in the body from overreacting, it is necessary to develop a suit that counteracts against the pressure in space.<ref name=thomas/><ref>cite book|last1=Hanslmeier|first1=Arnold|title=The Sun and Space Weather|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=1402006845|pages=166–67|edition=Illustrated</ref> The greatest danger is in attempting to hold one's breath before exposure, as the subsequent Uncontrolled decompression#Explosive decompression|explosive decompression can damage the lungs. These effects have been confirmed through various accidents (including in very-high-altitude conditions, outer space and training vacuum chambers).<ref name="Bellows2006" /><ref>cite web |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970603.html |title=Ask an Astrophysicist: Human Body in a Vacuum |website=Image the Universe! |publisher=NASA |accessdate=December 14, 2008</ref> Human skin does not need to be protected from vacuum and is gas-tight by itself. Instead, it only needs to be mechanically compressed to retain its normal shape. This can be accomplished with a tight-fitting elastic body suit and a helmet for containing breathing gases, known as a space activity suit (SAS).

 Design concepts 
Unreferenced section|date=February 2012
A space suit should allow its user natural unencumbered movement. Nearly all designs try to maintain a constant volume no matter what movements the wearer makes. This is because Work (physics)|mechanical work is needed to change the volume of a constant pressure system. If flexing a joint reduces the volume of the space suit, then the astronaut must do extra work every time he bends that joint, and he has to maintain a force to keep the joint bent. Even if this force is very small, it can be seriously fatiguing to constantly fight against one's suit. It also makes delicate movements very difficult. The work required to bend a joint is dictated by the formula

:<math>W=\int_{V_i}^{V_f} \,P\,dV</math>

where ''V<sub>i</sub>'' and ''V<sub>f</sub>'' are respectively the initial and final volume of the joint, ''P'' is the pressure in the suit, and ''W'' is the resultant work. It is generally true that all suits are more mobile at lower pressures. However, because a minimum internal pressure is dictated by life support requirements, the only means of further reducing work is to minimize the change in volume.

All space suit designs try to minimize or eliminate this problem. The most common solution is to form the suit out of multiple layers. The bladder layer is a rubbery, airtight layer much like a balloon. The restraint layer goes outside the bladder, and provides a specific shape for the suit. Since the bladder layer is larger than the restraint layer, the restraint takes all of the stresses caused by the pressure inside the suit. Since the bladder is not under pressure, it will not "pop" like a balloon, even if punctured. The restraint layer is shaped in such a way that bending a joint causes pockets of fabric, called "gores," to open up on the outside of the joint, while folds called "convolutes" fold up on the inside of the joint. The gores make up for the volume lost on the inside of the joint, and keep the suit at a nearly constant volume. However, once the gores are opened all the way, the joint cannot be bent any further without a considerable amount of work.

In some Russian space suits, strips of cloth were wrapped tightly around the astronaut#Russian|cosmonaut's arms and legs outside the space suit to stop the space suit from ballooning when in space.citation needed|date=August 2017

The outermost layer of a space suit, the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment, provides thermal insulation, protection from micrometeoroids, and shielding from harmful Sunlight|solar radiation.

There are four main conceptual approaches to suit design:
Image:AX-5-spacesuit.jpg|thumb|NASA's experimental AX-5 hard-shell space suit (1988)

=Soft suits=
Soft suits typically are made mostly of fabrics. All soft suits have some hard parts, some even have hard joint bearings. Intra-vehicular activity and early EVA suits were soft suits.

=Hard-shell suits=
Hard-shell suits are usually made of metal or composite materials and do not use fabric for joints. Hard suits joints use ball bearings and wedge-ring segments similar to an adjustable elbow of a stove pipe to allow a wide range of movement with the arms and legs. The joints maintain a constant volume of air internally and do not have any counter force. Therefore, the astronaut does not need to exert to hold the suit in any position. Hard suits can also operate at higher pressures which would eliminate the need for an astronaut to pre-breathe oxygen to use a convert|34|kPa|psi|abbr=on space suit before an EVA from a convert|101|kPa|psi|abbr=on spacecraft cabin. The joints may get into a restricted or locked position requiring the astronaut to manipulate or program the joint. The NASA Ames Research Center experimental Powered exoskeleton#NASA AX-5 hard shell space suit|AX-5 hard-shell space suit had a flexibility rating of 95%. The wearer could move into 95% of the positions he or she could while nude.

=Hybrid suits=
Hybrid suits have hard-shell parts and fabric parts. NASA's Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) uses a fiberglass Hard Upper Torso (HUT) and fabric limbs. ILC Dover's I-Suit replaces the HUT with a fabric soft upper torso to save weight, restricting the use of hard components to the joint bearings, helmet, waist seal, and rear entry hatch. Virtually all workable space suit designs incorporate hard components, particularly at interfaces such as the waist seal, bearings, and in the case of rear-entry suits, the back hatch, where all-soft alternatives are not viable.

=Skintight suits=
details|Space activity suit
Skintight suits, also known as mechanical counterpressure suits or space activity suits, are a proposed design which would use a heavy elastic body stocking to compress the body. The head is in a pressurized helmet, but the rest of the body is pressurized only by the elastic effect of the suit. This mitigates the constant volume problem,Citation needed|date=December 2017 reduces the possibility of a space suit depressurization and gives a very lightweight suit. When not worn, the elastic garments may appear to be that of clothing for a small child. These suits may be very difficult to put on and face problems with providing a uniform pressure. Most proposals use the body's natural perspiration to keep cool. Sweat evaporates readily in vacuum and may deposition (phase transition)|desublime or deposit on objects nearby: optics, sensors, the astronaut's visor, and other surfaces.  The icy film and sweat residue may contaminate sensitive surfaces and affect optical performance.

 Contributing technologies 
Expand section|date=October 2010
Related preceding technologies include the gas mask used in World War II, the oxygen mask used by pilots of high flying bombers in World War II, the high altitude or vacuum suit required by pilots of the Lockheed U-2 and Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71 Blackbird, the diving suit, rebreather, scuba diving gear, and many others.

Many space suit designs are taken from the U.S. Air Force suits, which are designed to work in “high altitude aircraft pressure[s],”<ref name=thomas/> such as the Navy Mark IV|Mercury IVA suit or the Gemini G4C, or the Advanced Crew Escape Suits.<ref name=nasa>cite web|title=NASA Spacesuits|url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/nasa_spacesuit/|website=NASA|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520023431/http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/nasa_spacesuit/|archivedate=May 20, 2010|df=mdy-all</ref>

=Glove technology=

The Navy Mark IV|Mercury IVA, the first U.S. space suit design, included lights at the tips of the gloves in order to provide visual aid. As the need for extravehicular activity grew, suits such as the Apollo/Skylab A7L|Apollo A7L included gloves made of a metal fabric called Chromel-r in order to prevent punctures. In order to retain a better sense of touch for the astronauts, the fingertips of the gloves were made of silicone. With the shuttle program, it became necessary to be able to operate spacecraft modules, so the ACES suits featured gripping on the gloves. EMU gloves, which are used for spacewalks, are heated to keep the astronaut's hands warm. The Phase VI gloves, meant for use with the Mark III (space suit)|Mark III suit, are the first gloves to be designed with "laser scanning technology, 3D computer modeling, stereo lithography, laser cutting technology and CNC machining." <ref group="NASA, ILC Dover Inc.">cite journal|last1=Graziosi|first1=David|last2=Stein|first2=James|last3=Ross|first3=Amy|last4=Kosmo|first4=Joseph|title=Phase VI Advanced EVA Glove Development and Certification for the International Space Station|date=21 January 2011</ref> This allows for cheaper, more accurate production, as well as increased detail in joint mobility and flexibility.

=Life support technology=

Prior to the Apollo program|Apollo missions, life support in space suits was connected to the space capsule via an umbilical cord-like device. However, with the Apollo missions, life support was configured into a removable capsule called the Primary Life Support System|Portable Life Support System that allowed the astronaut to explore the moon without having to be attached to the space craft. The EMU space suit, used for spacewalks, allows the astronaut to manually control the internal environment of the suit. The Mark III suit has a backpack filled with about 12 pounds of liquid air, as well as pressurization and heat exchange.<ref name=nasa/>

=Helmet technology=

The development of the spheroidal dome helmet was key in balancing the need for field of view, pressure compensation, and low weight. One inconvenience with some space suits is the head being fixed facing forwards and being unable to turn to look sideways. Astronauts call this effect "alligator head."

Emerging technologies
update|section|inaccurate=y|date=April 2017
Several companies and universities are developing technologies and prototypes which represent improvements over current space suits.

= Additive Manufacturing =
3D printing (Additive Manufacturing) can be used to reduce the mass of hard-shell space suits while retaining the high mobility they provide. This fabrication method also allows for the potential for in-situ fabrication and repair of suits, a capability which is not currently available, but will likely be necessary for Martian exploration.<ref>cite conference |url=https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/handle/2346/73066 |title=In-Situ Fabricated Space Suits for Extended Exploration and Settlement |last1=Bartlett |first1=Harrison |last2=Bowser |first2=Joseph |last3=Callejon Hierro |first3=Carlos |last4=Garner |first4=Sarah |last5=Guloy |first5=Lawrence |last6=Hnatov |first6=Christina |last7=Kalman |first7=Jonathan |last8=Sosis |first8=Baram |last9=Akin |first9=David |date=July 16, 2017 |conference=2017 International Conference on Environmental Systems |conference-url=https://www.ices.space/ |location=Charleston, SC |access-date=December 11, 2018 </ref>. The University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland began development of a prototype 3D printed hard suit in 2016, based on the kinematics of the Powered exoskeleton#NASA AX-5 hard shell space suit|AX-5. The prototype arm segment is designed to be evaluated in the Space Systems Laboratory glovebox to compare mobility to traditional soft suits. Initial research has focused on the feasibility of printing rigid suit elements, bearing races, ball bearings, seals, and sealing surfaces.<ref>cite conference |url=https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/handle/2346/74196 |title=Developing Technologies and Techniques for Additive Manufacturing of Spacesuit Bearings and Seals |last1=Garner |first1=Sarah |last2=Carpenter |first2=Lemuel |last3=Akin |first3=David |date=July 8, 2018 |conference=2018 International Conference on Environmental Systems |conference-url=https://www.ices.space/ |location=Albuquerque, NM |access-date=December 11, 2018 </ref>

= Astronaut Glove Challenge =
There are certain difficulties in designing a dexterous space suit glove and there are limitations to the current designs. For this reason, the Centennial Challenges#Astronaut glove challenge|Centennial Astronaut Glove Challenge was created to build a better glove. Competitions have been held in 2007 and 2009, and another is planned. The 2009 contest required the glove to be covered with a micro-meteorite layer.

= Final Frontier Design IVA Space Suit=

File:FFD IVA Space Suit.jpg|thumb|Final Frontier Design IVA Space Suit
Final Frontier Design (FFD) is developing a commercial full IVA space suit, with their first suit completed in 2010.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.space.com/8774-inventors-unveil-private-spacesuit-york.html |title='Inventors to Unveil Private Spacesuit in New York' |date=July 16, 2010 |accessdate=July 17, 2010 </ref> FFD's suits are intended as a light-weight, highly mobile, and inexpensive commercial space suits. Since 2011, FFD has upgraded IVA suit's designs, hardware, processes, and capabilities. FFD has built a total of 7 IVA space suit (2016) assemblies for various institutions and customers since founding, and has conducted high fidelity human testing in simulators, aircraft, microgravity, and hypobaric chambers. FFD has a Space Act Agreement with NASA’s Commercial Space Capabilities Office to develop and execute a Human Rating Plan for FFD IVA suit.<ref>cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/december/nasa-selects-commercial-space-partners-for-collaborative-partnerships/#.VJmkYBGdA |title='NASA Selects Commercial Space Partners for Collaborative Partnerships’ |date=December 23, 2014 |accessdate=December 24, 2010 </ref> FFD categorizes their IVA suits according to their mission: Terra for Earth-based testing, Stratos for high altitude flights, and Exos for orbital space flights. Each suit category has different requirements for manufacturing controls, validations, and materials, but are of a similar architecture.

=I-Suit=
The I-Suit is a space suit prototype also constructed by ILC Dover, which incorporates several design improvements over the EMU, including a weight-saving soft upper torso. Both the Mark III and the I-Suit have taken part in NASA's annual Desert Research and Technology Studies (D-RATS) field trials, during which suit occupants interact with one another, and with rovers and other equipment.

=Mark III=
The Mark III (space suit)|Mark III is a NASA prototype, constructed by ILC Dover, which incorporates a hard lower torso section and a mix of soft and hard components. The Mark III is markedly more mobile than previous suits, despite its high operating pressure (convert|57|kPa|psi|abbr=on|disp=or), which makes it a "zero-prebreathe" suit, meaning that astronauts would be able to transition directly from a one atmosphere, mixed-gas space station environment, such as that on the International Space Station, to the suit, without risking decompression sickness, which can occur with rapid depressurization from an atmosphere containing nitrogen or another inert gas.

= MX-2 =<!-- This section is linked from MX-2 -->
The MX-2 is a space suit analogue constructed at the University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland's Space Systems Laboratory. The MX-2 is usedwhen|date=February 2015 for manned neutral buoyancy testing at the Space Systems Lab's Neutral Buoyancy Research Facility. By approximating the work envelope of a real EVA suit, without meeting the requirements of a flight-rated suit, the MX-2 provides an inexpensive platform for EVA research, compared to using EMU suits at facilities like NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory.

The MX-2 has an operating pressure of 2.5–4 psi. It is a rear-entry suit, featuring a fiberglass Hard Upper Torso|HUT. Air, LCVG cooling water, and power are open loop systems, provided through an Umbilical cable|umbilical. The suit contains a Mac mini computer to capture sensor data, such as suit pressure, inlet and outlet air temperatures, and heart rate.<ref>cite web |url=http://ssl.umd.edu/projects/MARSsuit/index.shtml |title=MARS Suit: MX-2 |website=Space Systems Laboratory |publisher=University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland |location=College Park, MD |accessdate=June 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903111105/http://ssl.umd.edu/projects/MARSsuit/index.shtml |archive-date=September 3, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all </ref> Resizable suit elements and adjustable ballast allow the suit to accommodate subjects ranging in height from convert|68|to(-)|75|in|cm, and with a weight range of convert|120|lb|abbr=on.<ref>cite conference |url=http://www.sae.org/technical/papers/2006-01-2287 |title=System Overview and Operations of the MX-2 Neutral Buoyancy Space Suit Analogue |first1=Shane E. |last1=Jacobs |first2=David L. |last2=Akin |first3=Jeffrey R. |last3=Braden |date=July 17, 2006 |conference=International Conference On Environmental Systems |publisher=SAE International |id=2006-01-2287 |doi=10.4271/2006-01-2287 |accessdate=June 12, 2007</ref>

= Suitports =
A suitport is a theoretical alternative to an airlock, designed for use in hazardous environments and in human spaceflight, especially planetary surface exploration. In a suitport system, a rear-entry space suit is attached and sealed against the outside of a spacecraft, such that an astronaut can enter and seal up the suit, then go on EVA, without the need for an airlock or depressurizing the spacecraft cabin. Suitports require less mass and volume than airlocks, provide dust mitigation, and prevent cross-contamination of the inside and outside environments. Patents for suitport designs were filed in 1996 by Philip Culbertson Jr. of NASA's Ames Research Center and in 2003 by Joerg Boettcher, Stephen Ransom, and Frank Steinsiek.<ref name = culbertson>cite web

In 2012, NASA introduced the Z-1 space suit, the first in the Z-series of space suit prototypes designed by NASA specifically for planetary extravehicular activity. The Z-1 space suit includes an emphasis on mobility and protection for space missions. It features a soft torso versus the hard torsos seen in previous NASA EVA space suits, which provides reduced mass.<ref>cite web|last1=TIME Staff|title=NASA’s Z-1 Space Suit|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/11/01/best-inventions-of-the-year-2012/slide/nasas-z-1-space-suit/|website=TIME|publisher=TIME Magazine|accessdate=17 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220013042/http://techland.time.com/2012/11/01/best-inventions-of-the-year-2012/slide/nasas-z-1-space-suit/|archivedate=February 20, 2015|df=mdy-all</ref> It has been labeled the "Buzz Lightyear suit" due to its green streaks for a design.

In fiction
The earliest space fiction ignored the problems of traveling through a vacuum, and launched its heroes through space without any special protection.  In the later 19th century, however, a more realistic brand of space fiction emerged, in which authors have tried to describe or depict the space suits worn by their characters.  These fictional suits vary in appearance and technology, and range from the highly authentic to the utterly improbable.

A very early fictional account of space suits can be seen in Garrett P. Serviss' novel ''Edison's Conquest of Mars'' (1898).  Later comic book series such as Buck Rogers (1930s) and Dan Dare (1950s) also featured their own takes on space suit design. Science fiction authors such as Robert A. Heinlein contributed to the development of fictional space suit concepts.
