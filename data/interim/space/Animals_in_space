Non-human animals in space originally served to test the survivability of spaceflight, before human spaceflights were attempted. Later, other non-human animals were flown to investigate various biological processes and the effects microgravity and space flight might have on them. Bioastronautics is an area of bioengineering research which spans the study and support of life in Outer space|space. To date, seven national space programs have flown animals into space: the Soviet Union, the United States, France, Argentina, People's Republic of China|China, Japan and Iran.

A wide variety of non-human animals have been launched into space, including monkeys, Dogs in space|dogs, tortoises, mice, and insects.  The United States launched flights containing monkeys in space|monkeys and primates primarily between 1948-1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985. France launched two monkey-carrying flights in 1967. The Soviet Union and Russia launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet space program used Soviet space dogs|a number of dogs for sub-orbital and Orbital spaceflight|orbital space flights.<ref name="AT-20171103">cite news |last=Berger |first=Eric |title=The first creature in space was a dog.

Background
Animals had been used in aeronautic exploration since 1783 when the Montgolfier brothers sent a sheep, a duck, and a rooster aloft in a hot air balloon to see if ground-dwelling animals can survive (the duck serving as the experimental control). The limited supply of captured German V-2 rockets led to the U.S. use of high-altitude balloon launches carrying fruit flies, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, frogs, goldfish and monkeys to heights of up to convert|44000|m|ft mi|abbr=on.<ref name=Beischer1962>cite journal |author1=Beischer, DE |author2=Fregly, AR |title=Animals and man in space. A chronology and annotated bibliography through the year 1960. |journal=US Naval School of Aviation Medicine |volume=ONR TR ACR-64 |issue=AD0272581 |year=1962 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/9288 |accessdate=14 June 2011</ref> These high-altitude balloon flights from 1947 to 1960 tested radiation exposure, physiological response, life support and recovery systems. The U.S. high-altitude manned balloon flights occurred in the same time frame, one of which also carried fruit flies.

1940s
The  first animals sent into space were Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies aboard a U.S.-launched V-2 rocket on 20 February 1947 from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.<ref name=Beischer1962 /><ref>[http://www.postwarv2.com/usa/ws/uars/uars20.html UPPER AIR ROCKET SUMMARY V-2 NO. 20]. postwarv2.com</ref><ref>cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/afspbio/part1.htm |title=The Beginnings of Research in Space Biology at the Air Force Missile Development Center, 1946–1952 |accessdate=31 January 2008 |work=History of Research in Space Biology and Biodynamics |publisher=NASA| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080125044753/https://history.nasa.gov/afspbio/part1.htm| archivedate= 25 January 2008 | deadurl= no</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/FactSheets/V2/v-2tab.htm |title=V-2 Firing Tables |accessdate=31 January 2008 |publisher=White Sands Missile Range |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080125175018/http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/FactSheets/V2/v-2tab.htm |archivedate = 25 January 2008</ref> The purpose of the experiment was to explore the effects of radiation exposure at high altitudes. The rocket reached 68 miles (109&nbsp;km) in 3 minutes and 10 seconds, past both the U.S. Air Force 50-mile and the Karman line|international 100 km definitions of the boundary of space. The Blossom capsule was ejected and successfully deployed its parachute. The fruit flies were recovered alive. Other V-2 missions carried biological samples, including moss.

Albert II, a rhesus monkey, became the first monkeys in space|monkey in space on 14 June 1949, in a U.S.-launched V-2, after the failure of the original Albert's mission on ascent. Albert I reached only 30–39 miles (48–63&nbsp;km) altitude; Albert II reached about 83 miles (134&nbsp;km).  Albert II died on impact after a parachute failure. Numerous monkeys of several species were flown by the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s. Monkeys were implanted with sensors to measure vital signs, and many were under anesthesia during launch. The death rate among monkeys at this stage was very high: about two-thirds of all monkeys launched in the 1940s and 1950s died on missions or soon after landing.Citation needed|date=August 2016

1950s

On 31 August 1950, the U.S. launched a mouse into space (137&nbsp;km) aboard a V-2 (the Albert V flight, which, unlike the Albert I-IV flights, did not have a monkey), but the rocket disintegrated because the parachute system failed.<ref>[http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-animals-astronauts-in-space.php "Top 10 Animal Astronauts"]. ''Toptenz.net''.</ref> The U.S. launched several other mice in the 1950s.

On 22 July 1951, the Soviet Union launched the R-1 (missile)|R-1 IIIA-1 flight, carrying the dogs Tsygan (lang-ru|Цыган, "Gypsy") and Dezik (lang-ru|Дезик) into space, but not into orbit.<ref name="Siddiqi, p.95">cite book|title=Challenge to Apollo: The Soviet Union and the Space Race, 1945–1974|author=Asif.

The U.S. launched mice aboard spacecraft later that year; however, they failed to reach the altitude for true spaceflight.

On 3 November 1957, the second-ever orbiting spacecraft carried the first animal into orbit, the dog Laika,<ref name="AT-20171103" /> launched aboard the Soviet Sputnik 2 spacecraft (nicknamed 'Muttnik' in the West). Laika died during the flight, as was intended because the technology to return from orbit had not yet been developed.<ref name="AT-20171103" /> At least 10 other dogs were launched into orbit and Soviet space dogs|numerous others on sub-orbital flights before the historic date of 12 April 1961, when Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space.

On 13 December 1958, a Jupiter IRBM, AM-13, was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a United States Navy-trained South American squirrel monkey named Gordo (space monkey)|Gordo on board. The nose cone recovery parachute failed to operate and Gordo was lost. Telemetry data sent back during the flight showed that the monkey survived the 10&nbsp;g-force|g of launch, 8 minutes of weightlessness and 40&nbsp;g of reentry at 10,000 miles per hour (16,000&nbsp;km/h). The nose cone sank convert|1302|nmi|km downrange from Cape Canaveral and was not recovered.

Monkeys Able and Miss Baker|Baker became the first monkeys to survive spaceflight after their 1959 flight. On 28 May 1959, aboard Jupiter IRBM AM-18, were a 7-pound (3.18&nbsp;kg) American-born rhesus monkey, Able, from Independence, Kansas, and an 11-ounce (310-gram) squirrel monkey from Peru, Baker. The monkeys rode in the nose cone of the missile to an altitude of 360 miles (579&nbsp;km) and a distance of 1,700 miles (2,735&nbsp;km) down the Atlantic Missile Range from Cape Canaveral, Florida. They withstood forces 38 times the normal pull of gravity and were weightless for about 9 minutes. A top speed of 10,000&nbsp;mph (16,000&nbsp;km/h) was reached during their 16-minute flight. The monkeys survived the flight in good condition. Able died four days after the flight from a reaction to anesthesia, while undergoing surgery to remove an infected medical electrode. Baker was the center of media attention for the next several months as she was watched closely for any ill-effects from her space flight. She was even mated in an attempt to test her reproductive system.<ref>"Space Monkey to be a Bride." ''New York Times'':6. 14 August 1959. ''ProQuest''Web. 22 November 2015.</ref> Baker lived until 29 November 1984, at the US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

On 2 July 1959, a launch of a Soviet R2 rocket, which reached convert|212|km|mi|sp=us, carried two space dogs and Marfusa, the first rabbit to go into space.<ref name=Beischer1962 />

A 19 September 1959 launch, Jupiter AM-23, carried 2 frogs along with 12 mice but the rocket was destroyed during launch.<ref name=Beischer1962 />

1960s

On 19 August 1960 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 5 (also known as Korabl-Sputnik 2) which carried the dogs Belka and Strelka, along with a gray rabbit, 40 mice, 2 rats, and 15 flasks of fruit flies and plants.<ref>[https://history.nasa.gov/animals.html A brief History of Animals in Space].

The United States sent three black mice: Sally, Amy and Moe 1,000&nbsp;km up and 8,000&nbsp;km distance from Cape Canaveral on 13 October 1960 using an Atlas D 71D launch vehicle.  The mice were retrieved from the nosecone near Ascension Island and were said to be in good condition.<ref>cite web|title=1960 Chronology|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/1960.htm|accessdate=7 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926165622/http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/1960.htm|archivedate=26 September 2013|df=dmy-all</ref>

On 31 January 1961, Ham the Chimp was launched in a Mercury program|Mercury capsule aboard a Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Redstone rocket. Ham's mission was Mercury-Redstone 2.

On 18 October 1963, France launched Félicette the cat aboard Veronique AGI sounding rocket No. 47. The launch was directed by the French Centre d'Enseignement et de Recherches de Médecine Aéronautique (CERMA). Félicette was recovered alive after a 15-minute flight and a descent by parachute. Félicette had electrodes implanted into her brain, and the recorded neural impulses were transmitted back to Earth. A second cat was sent to space by CERMA on 24 October 1963, but the flight ran into difficulties that prevented recovery.<ref>cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/animals.html |title=A Brief History of Animals in Space |accessdate=29 November 2013 |last=Grey |first=Tara |year=2008 |publisher=NASA</ref> The final French animal launches were of two monkeys in March 1967.citation needed|date=November 2013

During the Voskhod program, two Soviet space dogs, Veterok (Ветерок, Little Wind) and Ugolyok (Уголёк, Blackie), were launched on 22 February 1966, on board Cosmos 110 and spent 22 days in orbit before landing on 16 March. This spaceflight of record-breaking duration was not surpassed by humans until Soyuz 11 in 1971 and still stands as the longest space flight by dogs.citation needed|date=November 2013

The United States launched Biosatellite I in 1966 and Biosatellite I/II in 1967 with fruit flies, parasitic wasps, flour beetles and frog eggs, along with bacterium|bacteria, amoebae, plants and fungi.<ref>Dubbs, Chris and Colin Burgess (author)|Burgess, Colin (2007) ''Animals In Space: From Research Rockets to the Space Shuttle''.

The first animals in deep space, the first to circle the Moon, and the first two tortoises in space were launched on Zond 5 on 14 September 1968 by the Soviet Union. The Horsfield's tortoises were sent on a circumlunar voyage to the Moon along with wine fly|wine flies, meal worms, and other biological specimens. These were the first inhabitants of Earth to travel around the Moon. The capsule overshot its terrestrial landing site but was successfully recovered at sea on 21 September. The animals survived but suffered some weight loss.

On 28 June 1969, the United States launched the monkey Bonny, a macaque, on Biosatellite 3 in what was intended to have been a 30-day orbit around the Earth, with the monkey being fed by food pellets from a dispenser that he had been trained to operate.  However, Bonny's health deteriorated rapidly and he was returned to Earth on July 7,<ref>[https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Mission/miss/56 "Biosatellite III", NASA Life Sciences Data Archive]</ref> but died the next day after the Biosatellite capsule was recovered in the Pacific Ocean.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=djft3U1LymYC&dat=19690708&printsec=frontpage "Astromonk Dies After Return"], ''Pittsburgh Press'', July 8, 1969, p1</ref>

In total in the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union launched missions with passenger slots for at least 57 dogs. The actual number of dogs in space is smaller, because some dogs flew more than once.

On 23 December 1969, as part of the 'Operación Navidad' (Operation Christmas), Argentina launched Juan (a Tufted capuchin|cai monkey, native of Argentina's Misiones Province) using a Canopus 2|Canopus II rocket.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu.ar/seccion/dossier/2009/diciembre/unc_dossier_de_prensa_19-12-2009.pdf|title=Córdoba|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160331/http://www.unc.edu.ar/seccion/dossier/2009/diciembre/unc_dossier_de_prensa_19-12-2009.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015|publisher=unc.edu.ar|date=19 December 2009</ref> It ascended 82 kilometers<ref>[http://www.hoylauniversidad.unc.edu.ar/especiales/mono-juan "Juan, el primer astronauta argentino"].

Skylab 3 carried pocket mice and the first fish in space (a mummichog), and the first spiders in space (garden spiders named Spider webs in space|Arabella and Anita). Mummichog were also flown by the U.S. on the Apollo-Soyuz joint mission, launched 15 July 1975.

The Soviets flew several Bion program missions which consisted of satellites with biological cargoes. On these launches they flew tortoises, rats, and mummichog. On Soyuz 20, launched 17 November 1975, tortoises set the duration record for an animal in space when they spent 90.5 days in space. Salyut 5 on 22 June 1976, carried tortoises and a fish (a zebra danio).

1980s
The Soviet Union sent eight monkeys into space in the 1980s on Bion flights. In 1985, the U.S. sent two squirrel monkeys aboard STS-51B|Spacelab 3 on the Space Shuttle with 24 male albino Rattus norvegicus|rats and stick insect eggs. Bion flights also flew zebra danio, fruit flies, rats, stick insect eggs and the first Iberian ribbed newt|newts in space.

Bion 7 (1985) had 10 newts (''Pleurodeles waltl'') on board. The newts had part of their front limbs amputated, to study the rate of Regeneration (biology)|regeneration in space, knowledge to understand human recovery from space injuries.

After an experiment was lost in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster, chicken embryos (fertilized eggs) were sent into space in an experiment on STS-29 in 1989. The experiment was designed for a student contest.

1990s
Four monkeys flew aboard the last Bion flights of the Soviet Union as well as frogs and fruit flies. The Foton program flights carried dormant brine shrimp (''Artemia franciscana''), newts, fruit flies, and sand desert beetles (''Trigonoscelis gigas'').<ref>Hernandorena, A.; Marco, R.; Reitz, G. and Facius, R.

On 15 March 2009, during the countdown of the STS-119, a free-tailed bat was seen clinging to the fuel tank. NASA observers believed the bat would fly off once the shuttle started to launch, but it did not. Upon analyzing the images, a wildlife expert who provided support to the center said it likely had a broken left wing and some problem with its right shoulder or wrist. The animal most likely perished quickly during ''Discovery'''s climb into orbit.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts119/launchbat.html "Bat Hung onto Shuttle During Liftoff"]. 19 March 2007.</ref>

In November 2009, STS-129 took painted lady and monarch butterfly larvae into space for a school experiment as well as thousands of Caenorhabditis elegans|''C. elegans'' roundworms for long-term weight loss studies.

2010s
On 3 February 2010, on the 31st anniversary of its revolution, Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran became the latest country to launch animals into space. The animals (a mouse, two turtles and some worms) were launched on top of the Safir (rocket)|Kavoshgar 3 rocket and returned alive to Earth.<ref name="Tehran Times ">cite news|url=http://tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=213671|title=Tehran Times|date=4 February 2010|work=Tehran Times Political Desk|publisher=Tehran Times|accessdate=5 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212225529/http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=213671|archivedate=12 February 2010|deadurl=no</ref><ref>cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35213146/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/|title='Iran sends mouse, worms, turtles into space|work=MSNBC|accessdate=2 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206001136/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35213146/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/|archivedate=6 February 2010 |deadurl=no</ref>

In May 2011, the last flight of Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'' (STS-134) carried two golden orb spiders, named Gladys and Esmeralda, as well as a fruit fly colony as their food source in order to study the effects of microgravity on spiders' behavior.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/space_spiders_live.html "Spiders in Space – Live!"].

In November 2011, the Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment on the Fobos-Grunt mission planned to carry tardigrades to Mars and back; however, the mission failed to leave Earth orbit.

In October 2012, 32 medaka fish were delivered to the International Space Station by Soyuz TMA-06M for the new Aquatic Habitat in the Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo module.

On 28 January 2013, Iranian news agencies reported that Iran sent a monkey in a "Pishgam" rocket to a height of convert|72|mi|km and retrieved a "shipment". Later Iran's space research website uploaded an 18-minute video.<ref>cite news|url=http://www.ari.ac.ir/index.php/news/35-lastest-developments/572-1391-11-30-12-41-51.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223023757/http://ari.ac.ir/index.php/news/35-lastest-developments/572-1391-11-30-12-41-51.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2013 |title=Reliability Research Center |language=Persian |accessdate=2 December 2014 </ref> The video was uploaded later on YouTube.<ref>cite news |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo-7QjxxcDg|title=Iran's Space Monkey Full High Quality Video|author=Mohammad Mohsenipur|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=2 December 2014</ref>

On 19 July 2014, Russia announced that they launched their Foton-M4 satellite into low Earth orbit (575 kilometers) with one male and four female geckos (possibly gold dust day geckos) as the payload. This was an effort to study the effects of microgravity on reproductive habits of reptiles.<ref>cite news |url= http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/space/stories/russia-launches-geckos-and-other-critters-into-space | work= MotherNatureNetwork | title= Russia launches geckos and other critters into space| date= 22 July 2014 </ref> On 24 July 2014, it was announced that Russia had lost control of the Foton-M4 satellite, leaving only two months to restore contact before the geckos' food supply was exhausted.<ref>cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/russia-loses-contact-satellite-geckos | work= TheGuardian| title= Russia loses contact with satellite full of geckos | date= 24 July 2014 </ref> Control of the satellite was subsequently restored on 28 July 2014.<ref>cite news |url= http://www.space.com/26661-russia-space-gecko-capsule-contact-restored.html | work= Space.com | title= Russia Restores Contact with Gecko-Filled Space Capsule | date= 28 July 2014 </ref> On 1 September 2014 Russia confirmed the death of all five geckos, stating that their mummified bodies seem to indicate they froze to death.

On 23 September 2014, the SpaceX SpaceX CRS-4|CRS-4 mission delivered 20 mice to live on the ISS for study of the long-term effects of microgravity on the rodents. This was the first use of the Rodent Research Hardware System.<ref name=Mousetronauts>Bergin, Chris. [http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/09/crs-4-dragon-tuesday-iss-arrival/ "SpaceX's CRS-4 Dragon completes Tuesday arrival at ISS"], NASA, 22 September 2014</ref>

On 14 April 2015, the SpaceX CRS-6 delivered 20 C57BL/6|C57BL/6NTAC mice to live on the ISS for evaluating microgravity as the extreme opposite of a healthy active lifestyle. In the absence of gravity, astronauts are subject to a decrease in muscle, bone, and tendon mass. "Although, we're not out to treat couch potatoes," states head Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research (NIBR) scientist on the project Dr. Sam Cadena, "we're hoping that these experiments will help us to better understand muscle loss in populations where physical activity in any form is not an option; e.g., in the frail elderly or those subjected to bed rest or immobilization due to surgery or chronic disease." <ref>cite web|title=Sixth Commercial Resupply Services Flight to the International Space Station|url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/SpaceX_CRS-6_Mission_Overview.pdf|website=NASA|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 April 2015</ref>

On 8 April 2016, Rodent Research 3 delivered 20 mice on SpaceX CRS-8. The experiment sponsored by Eli Lilly and Co. was a study of myostatin inhibition for the prevention of skeletal and muscle atrophy and weakness. Mice are known to suffer from rapid loss of muscle and bone mass after as little as 12 days of space flight exposure. The mice were euthanized and dissected on the station and then frozen for eventual return to Earth for further study.<ref>cite web|title=Dragon SpX-8 Cargo Overview|url=http://spaceflight101.com/dragon-spx8/cargo-overview/</ref>

On 29 June 2018, a SpaceX Dragon spaceship blasted off from Florida carrying 20 mice. The rodent crew arrived at the international Space Station|ISS on 2 July 2018. Their record-breaking journey — this was the longest mice have been off the planet — was part of a study on how Earth-dwellers' physiology and sleep schedules responded to the stress of being in space.<ref>cite web|title=NASA just launched 20 mice into space on a SpaceX rocket while their identical twins stay on Earth — here's what they hope to learn|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-launches-mice-to-space-station-for-twin-study-2018-6|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=29 July 2018</ref>
