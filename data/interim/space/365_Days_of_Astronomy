History
In 2008, astronomer Pamela Gay initiated brainstorming via e-mail on possible "new media" programs for 2009, the International Year of Astronomy (IYA). The discussion included Michael Koppelman from Slacker Astronomy, Phil Plait of Bad Astronomy, and others involved in the IYA. Their ideas were distilled down into the 365 Days Of Astronomy podcast. The podcast was to publish one episode per day over the entire year of 2009 and was originally planned to only run for that year.<ref>cite web|title=Cosmic Revelers Ring in 2009|url=http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=35873|publisher=Photonics Media|accessdate=12 September 2012</ref><ref>cite web|title=365 Days of Astronomy: About|url=http://365daysofastronomy.org/about/|publisher=365 Days of Astronomy|accessdate=12 September 2012</ref><ref>cite web|last=Gay|first=Pamela|authorlink=Pamela L.

Production
The intention is for individuals, schools, companies, and other organizations to record 5 to 10 minutes of audio for each episode. Contributors sign up for a particular day or for up to twelve episodes: one per month.<ref name="ADs">cite journal | bibcode=2009AAS...21346507K | title=The IYA 365 Days of Astronomy Podcast | author=Koppelman, Michael | journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society | volume=41 | pages=412</ref> Contributors include both professional and amateur astronomers as well as other scientists, historians, and others with an interest in astronomy. In the first three years of the project, contributors from every continent except Antarctica submitted episodes. Each episode has a common intro and outro that ties it to the overall theme. Avivah Yamani, project manager through 2012, was based in southeast Asia and expressed desire to encourage more diverse participants.<ref name="spaceref">cite web | url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=35398 | title=365 Days of Astronomy Podcast to Continue in 2012 | publisher=SpaceRef Interactive Inc. | date=November 30, 2011 | accessdate=August 6, 2012</ref>
