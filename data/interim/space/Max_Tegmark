Biography

=Early life=
Tegmark was born in Sweden, the son of Karin Tegmark and American-born professor of mathematics Harold S. Shapiro. While in high school, Tegmark and a friend created and sold a word processor written in pure machine code for the Swedish eight-bit computer ABC 80,<ref name="x42">cite web|url=http://x42.com/teddy/ |title=buzzword free zone - home of magnus bodin |publisher=X42.com |accessdate=2012-11-01</ref> and a 3D Tetris-like game called Frac.<ref>cite book|last=Tegmark|first=Max|title=The Mathematical Universe|page=55</ref>

Tegmark left Sweden in 1990 after receiving his Bachelor of Science|B.Sc. in Physics from the Royal Institute of Technology. (He had earned a B.A. in Economics the previous year at the Stockholm School of Economics.) His first academic venture beyond Scandinavia brought him to California, where he studied physics at the University of California, Berkeley, earning his Master of Arts|M.A. in 1992, and Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D. in 1994.<ref>Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/tegmark_max.html|title=MIT Department of Physics|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2018-02-12</ref>

After having workedvague|Reason = in what capacity?|date=June 2018 at the University of Pennsylvania, he is nowwhen|date=June 2018 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

=Career=
His research has focused on cosmology, combining theoretical work with new measurements to place constraints on cosmological models and their free parameters, often in collaboration with experimentalists. He has over 200 publications, of which nine have been cited over 500 times.<ref>cite web|url=https://inspirehep.net/author/profile/M.Tegmark.1 |title=INSPIRE-HEP: M Tegmark's profile|publisher=Inspire-Hep</ref> He has developed data analysis tools based on information theory and applied them to cosmic microwave background experiments such as Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE, QMAP, and WMAP, and to galaxy redshift surveys such as the Las Campanas Redshift Survey, the 2dF Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

With Daniel Eisenstein and Wayne Hu, he introduced the idea of using baryon acoustic oscillations as a standard ruler.<ref name=":0">Cite web|title = Tegmark - Philosophy of Cosmology|url = http://philosophy-of-cosmology.ox.ac.uk/tegmark.html|website = philosophy-of-cosmology.ox.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-15</ref><ref>cite journal |last=Eisenstein|first=Daniel J. |author2=Hu, Wayne |author3=Tegmark, Max |title=Cosmic Complementarity: <math>H_0</math> and <math>\Omega_m</math> from Combining Cosmic Microwave Background Experiments and Redshift Surveys|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=504|issue=2|pages=L57–L60|doi=10.1086/311582|arxiv = astro-ph/9805239 |bibcode = 1998ApJ...504L..57E </ref> With Angelica de Oliveira-Costa and Andrew Hamilton, he discovered the anomalous multipole alignment in the WMAP data sometimes referred to as the "axis of evil".<ref name=":0" /><ref>cite journal |last=Tegmark|first=Max |author2=de Oliveira-Costa, Angélica |author3=Hamilton, Andrew|title=High resolution foreground cleaned CMB map from WMAP|journal=Physical Review D|date=1 December 2003|volume=68|issue=12|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.68.123523|arxiv = astro-ph/0302496 |bibcode = 2003PhRvD..68l3523T </ref> With Anthony Aguirre, he developed the cosmological interpretation of quantum mechanics.

concluded that decoherence seems too rapid for Roger Penrose's "quantum microtubule" model of consciousness to be viable.<ref>cite journal |last=Seife|first=Charles |title=Cold numbers unmake the quantum mind|journal=Science|date=4 February 2000|volume=287|doi=10.1126/science.287.5454.791</ref>
Tegmark has also formulated the "mathematical universe hypothesis|Ultimate Ensemble theory of everything", whose only postulate is that "all structures that exist mathematically exist also physically". This simple theory, with no free parameters at all, suggests that in those structures complex enough to contain self-aware substructures (SASs), these SASs will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically "real" world. This idea is formalized as the mathematical universe hypothesis,<ref>cite journal|last=Tegmark|first=Max|title=The Mathematical Universe|journal=Foundations of Physics|volume=38|issue=2|pages=101–150|doi=10.1007/s10701-007-9186-9|bibcode = 2008FoPh...38..101T |arxiv = 0704.0646  a short version of which is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4024 ''Shut up and calculate.''] (in reference to David Mermin's famous quote "shut up and calculate" cite web |url=http://physicstoday.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_57/iss_5/10_1.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515100124/http://physicstoday.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_57/iss_5/10_1.shtml |archivedate=2016-05-15 |df= </ref> described in his book ''Our Mathematical Universe''.

Tegmark was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2012 for, according to the citation, "his contributions to cosmology, including precision measurements from cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering data, tests of inflation (cosmology)|inflation and gravitation theories, and the development of a new technology for low-frequency radio interferometry".<ref>[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/fellowships/archive-all.cfm?initial=T&year=2012&unit_id=DAP&institution= APS Archive (1990-present)]</ref>

Tegmark is interviewed in the 2018 documentary on artificial intelligence Do You Trust This Computer?

He is also known for his seminal paper on the ''Mathematical Universe Hypothesis,'' in which he claims that our physical world is an abstract mathematical structure with an infinite number of initial random conditions.<ref>Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The Mathematical Universe|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0646.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> He points to fractals as proof that the equations used to describe all possible mathematical multiverses would fit on a single T-shirt.<ref>Cite journal|last=Butterfield|first=Jeremy|date=2014-06-17|title=Our Mathematical Universe?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263201015_Our_Mathematical_Universe</ref>

He married astrophysicist Angelica de Oliveira-Costa in 1997, and divorced in 2009. They have two sons.<ref>cite web|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/personal.html |title=Max Tegmark Homepage |publisher=Space.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01</ref>  On August 5, 2012, Tegmark married Meia Chita.<ref>cite web|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/last_wedding.html |title=Welcome to Meia and Max's wedding |publisher=Space.mit.edu |accessdate=2014-01-10</ref><ref name=chita>cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/meia-chitategmark/ |title=Meia Chita-Tegmark|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2015-01-10</ref>
