Types of stellar collisions and mergers

=Type Ia supernova=
White dwarfs are the remnants of low-mass stars and, if they form a binary system with another star, they can cause large stellar explosions known as type Ia supernova. The normal route by which this happens involves a white dwarf drawing material off a main sequence or red giant star to form an accretion disc. However, a much rarer brand of type Ia supernova occurs when two white dwarfs orbit each other closely.<ref name = "González Hernández">cite journal | last = González Hernández | first = J.

=Neutron star mergers=
Main|Neutron star merger
Neutron star mergers occur in a fashion similar to the rare brand of type Ia supernovae resulting from merging white dwarfs. When two neutron stars orbit each other closely, they spiral inward as time passes due to gravitational radiation. When they meet, their merger leads to the formation of either a heavier neutron star or a black hole, depending on whether the mass of the remnant exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit. This creates a magnetic field that is trillions of times stronger than that of Earth, in a matter of one or two milliseconds.

=Thorne–Żytkow objects=
main article|Thorne–Żytkow object
If a neutron star collides with red giant of sufficiently low mass and density, both can survive in the form of a peculiar hybrid known as Thorne–Żytkow object, with a neutron star surrounded by a red giant.

= Binary star mergers =
Main|KIC 9832227
About half of all the stars in the sky are part of binary systems, with two stars orbiting each other.  Some binary stars orbit each other so closely that they share the same atmosphere, giving the system a peanut shape.  While most contact binary stars are stable, a few have become unstable and have merged in the past for reasons not well understood (see relevant section below).

Discovery
While the concept of stellar collision has been around for several generations of astronomers, only the development of new technology has made it possible for it to be more objectively studied. For example, in 1764, a cluster of stars known as Messier 30 was discovered by astronomer Charles Messier. In the twentieth century, astronomers concluded that the cluster was approximately 13 billion years old.<ref name= VAMP>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Stellar+collisions+and+vampirism+give+blue+straggler+stars+a+%22cosmic...-a0215188997 "Stellar Collisions and vampirism give blue stragglers stars a 'cosmic facelift'"], Asian News International, 29 December 2009</ref> The Hubble Space Telescope resolved the individual stars of Messier 30. With this new technology, astronomers discovered that some stars, known as “blue stragglers”, appeared younger than other stars in the cluster.<ref name=VAMP/> Astronomers then hypothesized that stars may have “collided”, or “merged”, giving them more fuel so they continued fusion while fellow stars around them started going out.<ref name=VAMP/>

Stellar collisions and the Solar System
While stellar collisions may occur very frequently in certain parts of the galaxy, the likelihood of a collision involving the Sun is very small. A probability calculation predicts the rate of stellar collisions involving the Sun is 1 in 10<sup>28</sup> years.<ref name='DAB'>cite web | url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/stellar_collisions_000601.html | title = Researchers Claim First Proof That Stars Collide | accessdate = 15 January 2014 | last = Lucentini | first = Jack | date = 1 June 2000 | website = Space.com | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040419035725/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/stellar_collisions_000601.html | archivedate = 19 April 2004|quote="By one calculation, the sun is likely to have one crash per 10,000 trillion, trillion years (that’s 28 zeros), and it will burn out on its own accord much sooner than that."</ref>
For comparison, the age of the universe is of the order 10<sup>10</sup> years. The likelihood of close encounters with the Sun is also small. The rate is estimated by the formula:
:''N'' ~ 4.2 · ''D''<sup>2</sup> Myr<sup>−1</sup>
where ''N'' is the number of encounters per million years that come within a radius ''D'' of the Sun in parsecs.<ref>citation | contribution = Perturbation of the Oort Cloud by Close Stellar Approaches | display-authors=1 | date=24 August 1998 | last1=Garcia-Sanchez | first1=J. | last2=Weissman | first2=P.

Our star will likely not be directly affected by such an event, but the Earth may be easily affected by a nearby collision. Astronomers say that if a stellar collision happens within 100 light years of the Earth, the resulting gamma-ray burst could possibly destroy all life on Earth.<ref name=DAB/> This is still very unlikely though because there are no stellar clusters this close to the Solar System.

KIC 9832227 and binary star mergers
KIC 9832227 is an example of an eclipsing contact binary star system.  It is mainly composed of two stars orbiting each other so closely that they share the same atmosphere, giving the system a peanut shape.  While astronomers have found hundreds of such contact binaries, KIC 9832227 is unusual in that it is unstable.  The merger of the cores of the two stars is predicted to be observed in 2022, exploding in the form of a luminous red nova in Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus.<ref>Cite arxiv|last=Kinemuchi |first=Karen |date=1 October 2013 |title=To Pulsate or to Eclipse?
