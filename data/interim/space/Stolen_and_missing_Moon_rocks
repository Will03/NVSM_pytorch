Of the 270 Apollo 11 Moon Rocks and Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rocks that were given to the nations of the world by the Nixon Administration, approximately 180 are unaccounted for. Many of the Moon rocks that are accounted for have been locked away in storage for decades. The location of the rocks has been tracked by researchers and hobbyists because of their rarity and the difficulty of obtaining more. Moon rocks have been subjects of theft and forgery as well.

Investigations
In 1998, a unique federal law enforcement undercover operation was created to identify and arrest individuals selling bogus Moon rocks. This sting operation was known as Operation Lunar Eclipse. Originally two undercover agents were involved in this sting, Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz of NASA Office of Inspector General|NASA's Office of Inspector General (NASA OIG), posing as Tony Coriasso, and Inspector Bob Cregger of the United States Postal Inspection Service, posing as John Marta. This sting operation was later expanded to include Agents from the United States Customs Service, namely, Special Agent Dwight Weikel and Special Agent Dave Atwood. Agents posted a quarter page advertisement in ''USA Today'' asking for Moon rocks. The Agents were targeting individuals selling bogus Moon rocks, which con artists sell to the elderly and to space enthusiasts. The sting operation was led by NASA OIG Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz.<ref>cite news|last=Hennessy-Fiske |first=Molly |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-moon-rock-20120208,0,4633684,full.story |title=Finding Lost Moon Rocks is His Mission |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=February 7, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-11</ref> For the first time in history the sting operation recovered an Apollo era Moon rock, the Honduras Goodwill Moon Rock. This Moon rock had been given to Honduras by President Nixon, fallen into private hands, and then offered to the Agents for $5 million. In order to recover this Moon rock, the agents had to come up with the $5 million requested by the seller. Billionaire and one-time Presidential Candidate H. Ross Perot was asked by one of the agents to put up the money, and did so.<ref>cite web|last=Kloc |first=Joe |url=http://atavist.net/the-case-of-the-missing-moon-rocks/ |title=The Case of the Missing Moon Rocks |publisher=The Atavist |date=February 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-11</ref>

After leaving NASA for a teaching position at the University of Phoenix, in Arizona, Gutheinz challenged his criminal justice graduate students to locate the goodwill Moon rocks.<ref>cite news|last=Gutheinz|first=Joseph Richard|title=In Search of the Goodwill Moon Rocks: A Personal Account|url=http://www.geotimes.org/nov04/trends.html|accessdate=November 14, 2012|newspaper=Geotimes Magazine|date=November 2004</ref><ref>cite news|last=Fernandez |first=Manny |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/science/space/nasa-tackles-problem-of-missing-moon-rocks.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all |title=NASA Searches for Loot That Traveled from Space to Another Void |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 21, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-11</ref><ref>cite web|last=Dasgupta |first=Debarshi |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?280382 |title=A Few Lunaroids: One man’s quest for pieces of the moon gifted by US to govts across the world |publisher=Outlookindia.com |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-11</ref>

He subsequently extended this project to also cover the missing Apollo 11 Moon rocks President Nixon gave to the states and nations of the world in 1969. Hundreds of graduate students have participated in this project from 2002 to the present and while many Moon rocks have been found, others are now known to be missing, stolen, or destroyed. Gutheinz patterned this college project after NASA's earlier Operation Lunar Eclipse, which he had participated in. Beginning in 2002, his graduate students began reporting to him that both the Cyprus Apollo 11 Moon rock (which is actually a collection of lunar dust in a Lucite ball) and Cyprus Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock (a pebble-size Moon rock) were missing. Operation Lunar Eclipse and the Moon Rock Project were the subject of the book ''The Case of the Missing Moon Rocks'' by Joe Kloc.

Spain
Main article|Spain lunar sample displays
Evidence surfaced that both Spain’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock and Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock which were given to General Francisco Franco’s Administration by the Nixon Administration were missing. Pablo Jáuregui, the Science Editor of ''El Mundo'', a Spanish newspaper, disclosed in a July 20, 2009 story entitled: "Franco's grandson:  My mother lost Moon stone given her by Grandfather" that the Spanish Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock had finally been given back to the people of Spain in 2007 by the family of Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco|Luis Carrero; and Jáuregui suggested that Spain’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock, as referenced in the title of the story, was last known to be in the Franco’s families hands, and is now unaccounted for. Jáuregui wrote, as translated: "As for the stone that Kissinger gave Carrero Blanco, confirmed yesterday" by "the son of …Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco"… "the stone was in possession of the family (first in the home of his widow, and after that of his eldest son ), until in 2007 they decided to donate it to the Naval Museum, where it is"…on display…. "today, along with a Spanish flag which traveled aboard the Apollo 17 mission to the moon. " My son told me that the gift was dedicated to 'Spanish people', so it seemed right to donate it," recalls Luis Carrero Blanco."

As for Spain’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock the trail is more confused. Jáuregui relates the following from Franco’s grandson: "The grandson of Franco stressed that neither he nor any other member of his family" had been told "that there might be some legal or ethical problem" regarding "the Moonstone. If you get anything and it's yours, why not going (translation) to sell?" He said. "In any case the rock never sold, but according to Franco, now" he does "not know where it is. As my mother is a woman with many things in many houses, in a move or redecorate a room, in the end had to go astray," he explains.<ref name = "motherlost">cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/07/20/ciencia/1248121248.html |title=Franco’s grandson: My mother lost the moonstone that was given to her by grandfather |date=July 20, 2009 |first1=Pablo |last1=Jáuregui |work=El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo|location=Madrid |accessdate=November 5, 2012|language=spanish</ref><ref name="Jauregui">cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/07/20/ciencia/1248121248.html |title=El hijo de Carrero Blanco donó otra roca al Museo Naval |work=El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo |first1=Pablo |last1=Jáuregui |date=July 20, 2009|location=Madrid |accessdate=November 5, 2012|language=spanish</ref><ref name="Jauregui2">cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/07/19/ciencia/1248023409.html |title=El misterio de la roca lunar que EEUU regaló a España |work=El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo |first1=Pablo |last1=Jáuregui |date=July 20, 2009|location=Madrid |accessdate=November 2, 2012|language=spanish</ref> Students assigned to the Moon Rock Project are currentlywhen|date=March 2013 looking for leads to Spain’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock in Switzerland.<ref>cite web |url=http://muzi.com/cc/english/10314,19931.shtml?q=10093341 |title=Apollo moon rocks lost in space?

In 1973, there was a massive fire at the Alaska Transportation Museum where the Moon rocks were being housed. Coleman Anderson (a crab-fishing captain who was on the TV show ''Deadliest Catch'') claimed to have gone to the museum to scrounge through the garbage from the fire to see if there would be anything worth saving. Anderson, who was a child at the time, claimed to have found the Moon rocks and cleaned them up over the next few years.

To clear title to the rocks he filed a lawsuit against the State of Alaska, asking the Court to deem the rocks his sole property.<ref>[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18058827/Complaint.pdf] The Official Complaint</ref>

Oregon
Main article|Oregon lunar sample displays
Toni Dowdell, a graduate student at the University of Phoenix, was assigned the task of hunting down the Oregon Apollo 11 Moon Rock while two of her teammates were charged with hunting down the Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rocks of Oregon and Louisiana. Toni Dowdell and her two teammates received this assignment from her professor, a retired Senior Special Agent with NASA's Office of Inspector General. This assignment was part of an ongoing assignment known as the Moon Rock Project, where students are assigned the task of hunting down Moon rocks all over America and the world.

In 1972, then 13-year-old Jaymie Matthews, now Astronomy Professor at the University of British Columbia,  lied about his age in order to compete in an essay contest, the winner of which would serve as a participant in a "10-day International Youth Science Tour, in which all the countries in the United Nations were invited to offer up "youth ambassadors" aged 17 to 21. These youth ambassadors were to witness first-hand the launch in Florida..." of Apollo 17…" Eighty countries accepted the invitation, including Canada. Matthews won the contest, and when his true age came out, Canadian officials decided to let him go anyway. As the student ambassador, it was decided that Canada's Goodwill Moon Rock was mailed to him where he kept it at his home.  Eventually he was asked to turn the Moon rock over to Canada, which he did. The rock was reportedly stolen in 1978, while on tour.<ref>[https://vancouversun.com/travel/astronomy+professor+kept+moon+rock+several+months/1801808/story.html "UBC astronomy professor kept moon rock for several months"] ''Vancouver Sun'', Pete McMartin, July 17, 2009.</ref>

In September 2009, while cooperating with a worldwide hunt for Moon rocks with Associated Press reporter Toby Sterling (Netherlands Bureau) and ''Cyprus Mail'' reporter Lucy Millett, the daughter of the British Ambassador to Cyprus, Gutheinz was advised by his friend and space memorabilia expert Robert Pearlman (CollectSpace.com) that Pearlman had learned in 2003 that the Cyprus Goodwill Moon Rock was never presented to Cyprus, but retained by the son of an American diplomat. The American government was advised about this situation in 2003 and did nothing. Upon learning the truth Gutheinz reached out to both the American Embassy in Cyprus and the Cyprus Government to convey the facts; he then filed a request for a Congressional Inquiry into the case of the missing Cyprus Goodwill Moon Rock.

In an October 23, 1999 story entitled "Atlanta Man Admits Trying to Sell Bogus Moon Rock", Reuters reported two brothers, Ronald and Brian Trochelmann, who were previously charged in 1998 in "U.S. District Court in Manhattan…"for…"a scheme to sell a phony moon rock for millions of dollars,"  both plead guilty to wire fraud, a felony, for perpetrating that scheme. "The brothers claimed that their father had invented a space-food packaging process that was used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration during the Apollo moon missions of the 1960s. The Trochelmann’s alleged that the rock had been brought from the moon by Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean and given to John Glenn. They claimed Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth and later a U.S. senator, had given the rock to their father in recognition of his supposed invention." …" The brothers had negotiated a consignment agreement with Phillips Son & Neale, a Manhattan auction house, to sell the rock in December 1995. However, before the auction took place, the rock was confiscated by FBI agents in December 1995 prior to the scheduled auction."<ref>[http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/business/moonrock_bogus_991025_wg.html  " Atlanta Man Admits Trying to Sell Bogus Moon Rock "] Reuters, Published in Space.com, October 23, 1999.</ref> This story first broke in a ''New York Times'' Article written by Lawrence Van Gelder on December 2, 1995.

"Eileen Hawley, a spokeswoman for NASA, said of the sample offered through Phillips & Neale: We have a rock that is classified as lost, an Apollo 12 lunar sample of approximately the same weight. With that information, we need to look at this—that this might be a true lunar sample. Ms. Hawley said a rock sample collected during the Apollo 12 mission had been part of a shipment of registered and certified mail that was stolen while en route to a researcher at the University of California in Los Angeles in 1970.

In an Aviation and Space Technology article published on September 27, 1976 entitled "Lunar Sample Damaged by Vandals" the author addresses a vandalism and possible theft attempt against a 40&nbsp;gram Apollo 17 Moon rock. The author states that the "Apollo 17 lunar sample on open display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum was slightly damaged…during an apparent vandalism attempt. It is possible that theft was the object of the attack on the sample, but both museum and National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials believe vandalism was the primary objective. About two cubic millimeters of the triangular fine-grained basalt were chipped away during the incident that involved a hard blow to the sample with a sharp object.  NASA believes no part of the sample was obtained by the vandal. The area around the sample's display case was swept immediately after the incident, and the sweeper bag is now at the Johnson Space Center, where it is being sifted in an attempt to obtain the missing material."

The author stated that "The 40-gram sample on display is the first touchable moon rock. Museum visitors are able to feel directly the texture of the lunar material, a departure from strict NASA policy that dictates that no individual ever handle lunar samples directly as a guard against contamination.
