This list contains all spacewalks performed since the beginning of 2015 where an astronaut has fully, or partially left the spacecraft.

As of 19 August 2016, 215 astronauts have made spacewalks (out of 549 people who have gone into Earth orbit).<ref name="numbers">cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/democurrent.html|title=Current Space Demographics| accessdate = 2007-10-26|publisher=CBS News|year=2007|author=William Harwood</ref><ref>cite web| author=NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration| title=Extravehicular Activities (EVA) Statistics Current as of 2/23/08|date=2008-09-29|publisher=NASA Office of Space Operations| url =http://www.hq.nasa.gov/osf/EVA/EVA_totals_table.html|accessdate =August 12, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070808173330/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/osf/EVA/EVA_totals_table.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = August 8, 2007</ref><ref>cite web|last = Alexander|first = Anikeev|title = Manned astronautics: facts and figures|date = 2006-09-11|url = http://space.kursknet.ru/cosmos/english/other/eva_cnt.sht|accessdate = 2006-09-15|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908033813/http://space.kursknet.ru/cosmos/english/other/eva_cnt.sht|archivedate = 2006-09-08|df = </ref>
