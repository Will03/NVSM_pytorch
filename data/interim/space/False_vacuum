Image:Falsevacuum.svg|thumb|240px|A scalar field ''φ'' in a false vacuum. Note that the energy ''E'' is higher than that in the true vacuum or ground state, but there is a barrier preventing the field from classically rolling down to the true vacuum. Therefore, the transition to the true vacuum must be stimulated by the creation of particle physics|high-energy particles or through quantum tunnelling|quantum-mechanical tunneling.

In quantum field theory, a false vacuum is a hypothetical vacuum state|vacuum that is somewhat, but not entirely, stable. It may last for a very long time in that state, and might eventually move to a more stable state. The most common suggestion of how such a change might happen is called False vacuum#Bubble nucleation|bubble nucleation - if a small region of the universe by chance reached a more stable vacuum, this 'bubble' would spread. 

A false vacuum may only exist at a maxima and minima|local minimum of energy and is therefore not stable, in contrast to a true vacuum, which exists at a global minimum and is stable. A false vacuum may be very long-lived, or metastability|metastable.

 True vs false vacuum 
refimprove|section|date=July 2017

A ground state|vacuum or vacuum state is defined as a space with as little energy in it as possible. Despite the name the vacuum state still has quantum fields.  A true vacuum is a global minimum of energy, and coincides with a local vacuum.  This configuration is stable.

It is possible that the process of removing the largest amount of energy and particles possible from a normal space results in a different configuration of quantum fields with a maxima and minima|local minimum of energy.  This local minimum is called a "false vacuum". In this case, there would be a barrier to entering the true vacuum. Perhaps the barrier is so high that it has never yet been overcome anywhere in the universe.

A false vacuum is unstable due to the quantum tunnelling of instanton|instantons to lower energy states. Tunnelling can be caused by quantum fluctuations or the creation of particle physics|high-energy particles. The false vacuum is a maxima and minima|local minimum, but not the lowest energy state.

 Standard Model vacuum 
refimprove|section|date=July 2017

If the Standard Model is correct, the elementary particle|particles and fundamental force|forces we observe in our universe exist as they do because of underlying quantum fields. Quantum fields can have states of differing stability, including 'stable', 'unstable', or 'metastability|metastable' (meaning very long-lived but not completely stable). If a more stable vacuum state were able to arise, then existing particles and forces would no longer arise as they do in the universe's present state. Different particles or forces would arise from (and be shaped by) whatever new quantum states arose. The world we know depends upon these particles and forces, so if this happened, everything around us, from subatomic particles to galaxy|galaxies, and all fundamental forces, would be reconstituted into new fundamental particles and forces and structures. The universe would lose all of its present structures and become inhabited by new ones (depending upon the exact states involved) based upon the same quantum fields.

Many scientific models of the universe have included the possibility that it exists as a metastability|long-lived, but not completely stable, sector of space, which could potentially at some time be destroyed upon 'toppling' into a more stable vacuum state.<ref name="turnerwilczek">

Existential threat
In a 2005 paper published in ''Nature (journal)|Nature'', as part of their investigation into global catastrophic risks, MIT physicist Max Tegmark and Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom calculate the natural risks of the destruction of the Earth at less than 1 per gigayear from all events, including a transition to a lower vacuum state. They argue that due to Anthropic principle|observer selection effects, we might underestimate the chances of being destroyed by vacuum decay because any information about this event would reach us only at the instant when we too were destroyed. This is in contrast to events like risks from impacts, gamma-ray bursts, supernovae and hypernovae, whose frequencies we have adequate direct measures of.<ref name="tegmarkbostrom">

Vacuum decay<!-- This section is linked from Ultimate fate of the universe -->

Vacuum decay would be theoretically possible if our universe had a false vacuum in the first place, an issue that was highly theoretical and far from resolved in 1982.<ref name="turnerwilczek"/> If this were the case, a bubble of lower-energy vacuum could come to exist by chance or otherwise in our universe, and catalysis|catalyze the conversion of our universe to a lower energy state in a volume expanding at nearly the speed of light, destroying all of the observable universe without forewarning.<ref name="colemandeluccia" /> Eternal inflation|Chaotic Inflation Theory suggests that the universe may be in either a false vacuum or a true vacuum state.

A paper by Coleman and de Luccia which attempted to include simple gravitational assumptions into these theories noted that if this was an accurate representation of nature, then the resulting universe "inside the bubble" in such a case would appear to be extremely unstable and would almost immediately collapse:<ref name="colemandeluccia" />

Quote box|In general, gravitation makes the probability of vacuum decay smaller; in the extreme case of very small energy-density difference, it can even stabilize the false vacuum, preventing vacuum decay altogether. We believe we understand this. For the vacuum to decay, it must be possible to build a bubble of total energy zero. In the absence of gravitation, this is no problem, no matter how small the energy-density difference; all one has to do is make the bubble big enough, and the volume/surface ratio will do the job. In the presence of gravitation, though, the negative energy density of the true vacuum distorts geometry within the bubble with the result that, for a small enough energy density, there is no bubble with a big enough volume/surface ratio. Within the bubble, the effects of gravitation are more dramatic. The geometry of space-time within the bubble is that of anti-de Sitter space, a space much like conventional de Sitter space except that its group of symmetries is O(3, 2) rather than O(4, 1). Although this space-time is free of singularities, it is unstable under small perturbations, and inevitably suffers gravitational collapse of the same sort as the end state of a contracting Friedmann universe. The time required for the collapse of the interior universe is on the order of ... microseconds or less.

The possibility that we are living in a false vacuum has never been a cheering one to contemplate. Vacuum decay is the ultimate ecological catastrophe; in the new vacuum there are new constants of nature; after vacuum decay, not only is life as we know it impossible, so is chemistry as we know it. However, one could always draw stoicism|stoic comfort from the possibility that perhaps in the course of time the new vacuum would sustain, if not life as we know it, at least some structures capable of knowing joy. This possibility has now been eliminated.

The second special case is decay into a space of vanishing cosmological constant, the case that applies if we are now living in the debris of a false vacuum which decayed at some early cosmic epoch. This case presents us with less interesting physics and with fewer occasions for rhetorical excess than the preceding one. It is now the interior of the bubble that is ordinary Minkowski space...|source = Sidney Coleman and Frank De Luccia|align = center

Such an event would be one possible global catastrophic risk|doomsday event. It was used as a plot device in a science-fiction story in 1988 by Geoffrey A. Landis,<ref name="landis">cite journal | author=Geoffrey A.

In theory, either high enough energy concentrations or random chance could trigger the tunneling needed to set this event in motion. However an immense number of Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray|ultra-high energy particles and events have occurred in the history of our universe, dwarfing by many orders of magnitude any events at human disposal.

Cosmic ray collisions have been observed at and beyond energies of 10<sup>18</sup> Electronvolt|eV, a million times more powerful&nbsp;– the so-called Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit – and other cosmic events may be more powerful yet.

Fears of this kind were raised by critics of both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider at the time of their respective proposal, and determined to be unfounded by scientific inquiry.

Bubble nucleation<!-- Bubble nucleation redirects here -->

Therefore, the interior of the bubble has a lower energy. The walls of the bubble (or Domain wall (string theory)|domain walls) have a surface tension, as energy is expended as the fields roll over the potential barrier to the lower energy vacuum. The most likely size of the bubble is determined in the semi-classical approximation to be such that the bubble has zero total change in the energy: the decrease in energy by the true vacuum in the interior is compensated by the tension of the walls.

Joseph Lykken has said that study of the exact properties of the Higgs boson could shed light on the possibility of vacuum collapse.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21499765 "Cosmos may be 'inherently unstable'."]</ref>

=Expansion of bubble=

Any increase in size of the bubble will decrease its potential energy, as the energy of the wall increases as the surface area of a sphere <math>4 \pi r^2</math> but the negative contribution of the interior increases more quickly, as the volume of a sphere <math>\textstyle\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</math>. Therefore, after the bubble is nucleated, it quickly begins expanding at very nearly the speed of light. The excess energy contributes to the very large kinetic energy of the walls. If two bubbles are nucleated and they eventually collide, it is thought that particle production would occur where the walls collide.

The tunnelling rate is increased by increasing the energy difference between the two vacua and decreased by increasing the height or width of the barrier.

Gravitational effects

The addition of gravity to the story leads to a considerably richer variety of phenomena. The key insight is that a false vacuum with positive potential energy density is a De Sitter universe#No ordinary matter but a positive cosmological constant|de Sitter vacuum, in which the potential energy acts as a cosmological constant and the Universe is undergoing the exponential expansion of de Sitter space. This leads to a number of interesting effects, first studied by Sidney Coleman|Coleman and de Luccia.<ref name="colemandeluccia"/>
