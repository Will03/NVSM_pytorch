The Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) comprised a set of scientific instruments placed by the astronauts at the landing site of each of the five Apollo program|Apollo missions to land on the Moon following Apollo 11 (Apollos Apollo 12|12, Apollo 14|14, Apollo 15|15, Apollo 16|16, and Apollo 17|17). Apollo 11 left a smaller package called the Early Apollo Scientific Experiments Package, or EASEP.

Background
The instrumentation and experiments that would comprise ALSEP were decided in February 1966. Specifically, the experiments, institutions responsible, and principal investigators and coinvestigators were:ref|EAweb

L. Kovach; United States Geological Survey, J. S. Watkins.

The ALSEP was built and tested by Bendix Corporation|Bendix Aerospace in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The instruments were designed to run autonomously after the astronauts left and to make long-term studies of the lunar environment. They were arrayed around a Central Station which supplied power generated by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) to run the instruments and communications so data collected by the experiments could be relayed to Earth. Thermal control was achieved by passive elements (insulation, reflectors, thermal coatings) as well as power dissipation resistors and heaters. Data collected from the instruments were converted into a telemetry format and transmitted to Earth.

Deployment
The ALSEP was stored in the Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module's Scientific Equipment (SEQ) Bay in two separate subpackages. The base of the first subpackage formed the Central Station while the base of the second subpackage was part of the RTG. A subpallet was also attached to the second subpackage which usually carried one or two of the experiments and the antenna gimbal assembly. On Apollo 12, 13, and 14, the second subpackage also stored the Lunar Hand Tool Carrier (HTC). The exact deployment of experiments differed by mission. The following pictures show a typical procedure from Apollo 12.

|Alan Bean removes the second subpackage from the SEQ bay. This was accomplished by using the boom which can be seen extended and a pulley system to set it on the ground. By Apollo 17, astronauts felt that the use of the boom and pulley system complicated the operation. And as such, the entire system was removed for Apollo 17. On Apollo 11, Buzz Aldrin chose not to use the system because of a lack of time.

|Bean is attempting to remove the fuel element from the cask using the Fuel Transfer Tool (FTT). Note one of the Universal Hand Tools (UHT) attached to the RTG subpackage. On Apollo 12, the fuel element stuck in the cask because of thermal expansion (Bean could feel the heat through his suit). Conrad pounded the side of the cask with a hammer while Bean successfully worked it loose. He then inserted it into the RTG and discarded the FTT.

|Central Station
|Image:Central Station.jpg|150px
|Image:ALSEP Apollo 16 Central Station.jpg|150px
|The picture shows the Central Station from Apollo 16's ALSEP.<br>The Central Station was essentially the command center for the entire ALSEP station. It received commands from Earth, transmitted data, and distributed power to each experiment. Communications with Earth were achieved through a 58&nbsp;cm long, 3.8&nbsp;cm diameter modified axial-helical antenna mounted on top of the Central Station and pointed towards Earth by the astronauts. Transmitters, receivers, data processors and multiplexers were housed within the Central Station. The Central Station was a 25&nbsp;kg box with a stowed volume of 34,800 cubic cm. In addition, on Apollos 12 to 15, a Dust Detector was mounted on the Central Station which measured the accumulation of Lunar dust.

|Image:ALSEP Apollo 14 RTG.jpg|150px
|The picture shows the RTG from Apollo 14 with the Central Station in the background.<br>The RTG was the power source for the ALSEP. It utilized the heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium-238 and thermocouples to generate approximately 70 watts of power. The base of the RTG was the base of the second ALSEP subpackage.
|-
|RTG Cask
|
|Image:ALSEP Ap14-KSC-70P-508.jpg|150px
|The RTG cask stored the plutonium-238 fuel element. It was located to left of the SEQ bay. The cask was designed to withstand a launch vehicle explosion in the event of an abort or a re-entry into Earth's atmosphere (which is what occurred on Apollo 13). The picture shows Edgar Mitchell practicing the removal of the fuel element.

|Through the use of seismology the internal structure of the Moon could be determined to several hundred feet underground. The ASE consisted of three major components. A set of three geophones was laid out in a line by an astronaut from the Central Station to detect the explosions.<ref name="Brzostowski pp 414-416">Brzostowski and Brzostowski, pp 414-416</ref> A mortar package was designed to lob a set of four explosives from varying distances away from the ALSEP. Finally, an astronaut-activated Thumper was used to detonate one of 22 charges to create a small shock. The diagram shows the Thumper device.
|-
|Charged Particle Lunar Environment Experiment (CPLEE)
|
|The CPLEE was designed to measure the fluxes of charged particles such as electrons and ions.
|-
|Cold Cathode Gauge Experiment (CCGE)
|Image:Cold Cathode Gauge Experiment.jpg|125px
|The CCGE was essentially a stand-alone version of the CCIG.
|-
|Cold Cathode Ion Gauge (CCIG)
|
|The CCIG experiment was designed to measure the pressure of the Atmosphere of the Moon|Lunar atmosphere. It was originally designed to be part of the SIDE, but its strong magnetic field would have caused interference. The CCIG is on the right of the SIDE in the diagram.
|-
|Heat Flow Experiment (HFE)
|
|The HFE was designed to make thermal measurements of the Lunar subsurface in order to determine the rate at which heat flows out of the interior.<ref>cite web |url=https://eos.org/research-spotlights/the-case-of-the-missing-lunar-heat-flow-data-is-finally-solved |title=The Case of the Missing Lunar Heat Flow Data Is Finally Solved |author=Sarah Stanley |date=25 June 2018 |via=Eos (magazine) |publisher=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |access-date=9 July 2018</ref> The measurements could help determine the abundance of radioisotopes and help understand the thermal evolution of the Moon. The HFE consisted of an electronics box and two probes. Each probe was placed in a hole by an astronaut that was drilled to about 2.5 m deep.
|-
|Laser Ranging Retroreflector (LRRR)
|Image:Laser Ranging Retroreflector.gif|125px

List of missions
Each mission had a different array of experiments.

=Apollo 11 (EASEP)=
Image:Buzz Aldrin carries the EASEP.jpg|thumb|right|200px|On Apollo 11, Buzz Aldrin simply carried the EASEP to the deployment site by using handles. This is different from the carrybar used on later missions.
Because of the risk of an early abort on the Moon, geologists persuaded NASA to permit only experiments that could be set up or completed in 10 minutes.<ref name="lindoh">[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/LindDL/linddl.pdf Don L. Lind oral history transcript], NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, 27 May 2005.</ref> As a result, Apollo 11 did not leave a full ALSEP package, but left a simpler version called the Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package (EASEP). Since there was only one 2 hour 40 minute EVA planned, the crew would not have enough time to deploy a full ALSEP, which usually took one to two hours to deploy. Both packages were stored in the LM's SEQ bay.

Engineers designed the EASEP to deploy with one squeeze handle, and the Laser Ranging Retro Reflector (LRRR) also deployed within ten minutes. Despite the simpler design, the seismometer was sensitive enough to detect Neil Armstrong's movements during sleep.r|lindoh

After Apollo
The ALSEP system and instruments were controlled by commands from Earth. The stations ran from deployment until they were turned off on 30 September 1977 due primarily to budgetary considerations. Additionally, by 1977 the power packs could not run both the transmitter and any other instrument, and the ALSEP control room was needed for the attempt to reactivate Skylab. ALSEP systems are visible in several images taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter during its orbits over Apollo landing sites.
