wiktionary

lang|la|Ex nihilo is a Latin phrase meaning "out of nothing". It often appears in conjunction with the concept of Creationism|creation, as in lang|la|creatio ex nihilo, meaning "creation out of nothing", chiefly in philosophical or theological contexts, but it also occurs in other fields.

In theology, the common phrase lang|la|creatio ex nihilo (Literal translation|"creation out of nothing"|lk=on), contrasts with lang|la|creatio ex materia (creation out of some pre-existent, eternal matter) and lang|la|creatio ex deo (creation out of the being of God). lang|la|Creatio continua is the ongoing divine creation.

The phrase lang|la|ex nihilo also appears in the classical philosophical formulation lang|la|ex nihilo nihil fit, which means "out of nothing comes nothing".

When used outside of religious or metaphysical contexts, lang|la|ex nihilo also refers to something coming from nothing. For example, in a conversation, one might call a topic "lang|la|ex nihilo" if it bears no relation to the previous topic of discussion.

History
Ancient Near Eastern mythologies and classical creation myths in Greek mythology envisioned the creation of the world as resulting from the actions of a god or gods upon already-existing primeval matter, known as ''Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos''.<ref>Gonzalo Rubio, "Time Before Time: Primeval Narratives in Early Mesopotamian Literature"; in ''Time and History in the Ancient Near East: Proceedings of the 56th Recontre Assyriologique Internationale at Barcelona, 26–30 July 2010'', ed. L. Feliu et al.; Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbrauns, 2013; ISBN|978-1-57506-255-6</ref>

An early conflation of Greek philosophy with the Genesis creation narrative|narratives in the Hebrew Bible came from Philo of Alexandria (d.nbspADnbsp50), writing in the context of Hellenistic Judaism. Philo equated the Hebrew creator deity, Yahweh, with Aristotle's ''primum movens'' (First Cause)<ref>cite web |author=Yonge, Charles Duke (1854) |title=Appendices A Treatise Concerning the World (1): But what can be worse than this, or more calculated to display the want of true nobility existing in the soul, than the notion of causes in general being secondary and created causes, combined with an ignorance of the one first cause, the uncreated God, the Creator of the universe, who for these and innumerable other reasons is most excellent, reasons which because of their magnitude human intellect is unable to apprehend?"

The classical tradition of creation from chaos first came under question in Hellenistic philosophy (on ''A priori and a posteriori|a priori'' grounds), which developed the idea that the primum movens must have created the world out of nothing.citation needed|date=August 2016

Theologians debate whether the Bible itself teaches creation ''ex nihilo''. Traditional interpreters<ref>
Collins, C. John, ''Genesis 1-4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary'' (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing, 2006), 50ff.

| quote = Probably the idea of creation never entered the human mind apart from Revelation. Though some of the pagan philosophers attained to a relatively high conception of God as the supreme ruler of the world, they seem never to have drawn the next logical inference of His being the absolute cause of all finite existence. [...] The descendants of Sem and Abraham, of Isaac and Jacob, preserved the idea of creation clear and pure; and from the opening verse of Genesis to the closing book of the Old Testament the doctrine of creation runs unmistakably outlined and absolutely undefiled by any extraneous element. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." In this, the first, sentence of the Bible we see the fountain-head of the stream which is carried over to the new order by the declaration of the mother of the Machabees: "Son, look upon heaven and earth, and all that is in them: and consider that God made them out of nothing" (2 Maccabees 7:28). One has only to compare the Mosaic account of the creative work with that recently discovered on the clay tablets unearthed from the ruins of Babylon to discern the immense difference between the unadulterated revealed tradition and the puerile story of the cosmogony corrupted by polytheistic myths. Between the Hebrew and the Chaldean account there is just sufficient similarity to warrant the supposition that both are versions of some antecedent record or tradition; but no one can avoid the conviction that the Biblical account represents the pure, even if incomplete, truth, while the Babylonian story is both legendary and fragmentary (Smith, "Chaldean Account of Genesis", New York, 1875).</ref> which became important to Judaism, to ongoing strands in the Christian tradition, and—as a corollary—to Islam.

The first sentence of the Greek version of Genesis in the Septuagint starts with the words: ἐν ἀρχῇ ἐποίησεν, translatable as "in the beginning he made".<ref>cite book|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Gary Alan|title=The Greek of the Septuagint|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=NA-mTy4X_WAC&pg=PR11|isbn=9781565637412|year=2011</ref>

A verse of 2 Maccabees (a book written in Koine Greek in the same sphere of Hellenized Judaism of Alexandria, but predating Philo by about a century) expresses the following: "I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind made likewise." (2nbspMaccabees 7:28, KJV).  While those who believe in ''ex nihilo'' point to God creating "things that were not", those who reject creation out of nothing point out that the context mentions the creation of man, who was "made from the dust" and not from absolutely "nothing". Many ancient texts tend to have similar issues, and those on each side tend to interpret the text according to their understanding.

Max Weber summarizes a sociology|sociological view of the overall development and corollaries of the theological idea:
<blockquote>
[...] As otherworldly expectations become increasingly important, the problem of the basic relationship of god to the world and the problem of the world's imperfections press into the foreground of thought; this happens the more life here on earth comes to be regarded as a merely provisional form of existence when compared to that beyond, the more the world comes to be viewed as something created by god ''ex nihilo'', and therefore subject to decline, the more god himself is conceived as a subject to transcendental goals and values, and the more a person's behavior in this world becomes oriented to his fate in the next.

A major argument for ''creatio ex nihilo'', the first cause argument, states in summary:citation needed|date=January 2017
# everything that begins to exist has a cause
# the universe began to exist
# therefore, the universe must have a cause

An expansion of the first cause argument is the Kalam cosmological argument, which also requires ''creatio ex nihilo'':citation needed|date=January 2017 
# Everything that begins to exist has a cause
# The universe began to exist
# Therefore, the universe has a cause.
# If the universe has a cause, then an uncaused, personal creator of the universe exists, who without the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless, and infinitely powerful.
# Therefore, an uncaused, personal creator of the universe exists, who without the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless, and infinitely powerful.

Another argument for ''ex nihilo'' creation comes from Claude Nowell's Summum philosophy that states before anything existed, nothing existed, and if nothing existed, then it must have been possible for nothing to be. If it is possible for nothing to be (the argument goes), then it must be possible for everything to be.<ref>

 |quote       = First, says Hesiod, there came to be Chaos, and then Earth, Tartarus (which Voegelin curiously neglects in his account), and Eros. For Voegelin this is a creatio ex nihilo, which points the finger of questioning towards the yet undifferentiated beyond. If he is right, the Greek philosophers who followed were unanimous in retreating from this seeming violation of the principle of sufficient reason to the principle that ex nihilio nihil fit.[sic]

In ''The Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma'' (''Kitāb al-Amānāt wa l-Iʿtiqādāt'', ''Emunoth ve-Deoth'', completed 933) written by Saadia Gaon (c. 882−942) the metaphysical problems of the creation of the world and the unity of the Creator are discussed. In this book, Saadia Gaon gives four proofs for the doctrine of the Creation myth|creation of the world ''ex nihilo'' (''Ayin and Yesh|yesh me-ayin'').

To harmonize the biblical statement of the creation ''ex nihilo'' with the doctrine of the primordial elements, the ''Sefer Yetzirah'' assumes a double creation, one ideal and the other real.<ref name=JewishEncyclopedia>Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=YEẒIRAH, SEFER|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13386-sefer-yezirah|accessdate=16 April 2013<br>

In introducing ''Sefer Yetzirah's'' theory of creation Saadia Gaon makes a distinction between the Biblical account of creation ''ex nihilo'', in which no process of creation is described, and ''matter formed by speech'' as described in ''Sefer Yetzirah''. The cosmogony of ''Sefer Yetzirah'' is even omitted from the discussion of creation in his magnum opus ''Emunoth ve-Deoth''.

Early Islamic philosophy, as well as key Muslim schools of thought, have argued a wide array of views, the basis always being that the creator was an eternal being who was outside of the creation (i.e., any materially based entities within all of creation), and was not a part of creation. Several schools of thought stemming from the first cause argument, and a great deal of philosophical works from Muslim scholars such as Al-Ghazali, came from the following verses in the Qur'an. The following quotations come from Muhammad Asad's translation, ''The Message of The Qur'an'':
* 52:35: "Were they created by nothing? Or were they themselves the creators?" 
* 2:117: "The Originator is He of the heavens and the earth: and when He wills a thing to be, He but says unto it, 'Be'—and it is."
* 19:67: "But does man not bear in mind that We have created him aforetime while at one point they were nothing?"
* 21:30: "ARE, THEN, they who are bent on denying the truth not aware that the heavens and the earth were [once] one single entity, which We (formal singular) then parted asunder? – and [that] We made out of water every living thing? Will they not, then, [begin to] believe?"
* 21:56: "He answered: 'Nay, but your [true] Sustainer is the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth—He who has brought them into being: and I am one of those who bear witness to this [truth]!'"
* 35:1: "ALL PRAISE is due to God, Originator of the heavens and the earth, who causes the angels to be (His) message-bearers, endowed with wings, two, or three, or four. He adds to His creation whatever He Wills: for, verily, God, is most competent over all things."
* 51:47: "It is We (formal singular) who have built the heaven with (Our creative) power; and, verily, it is We who are steadily expanding it."

To expound the term 'beginning,' of Christ, is altogether frivolous. For Moses simply intends to assert that the world was not perfected at its very commencement, in the manner in which it is now seen, but that it was created an empty chaos of heaven and earth. His language therefore may be thus explained. When God in the beginning created the heaven and the earth, the earth was empty and waste. He moreover teaches by the word 'created,' that what before did not exist was now made; for he has not used the term יצר, (yatsar,) which signifies to frame or forms but ברא, (bara,) which signifies to create. Therefore his meaning is, that the world was made out of nothing. Hence the folly of those is refuted who imagine that unformed matter existed from eternity; and who gather nothing else from the narration of Moses than that the world was furnished with new ornaments, and received a form of which it was before destitute."

Opposing arguments
See also|Parmenides|Nothing comes from nothing

=Logical=
The "first cause" argument was rooted in ancient Greek philosophy and based on observation in physics. Originally, it was understoodby whom|date=April 2017 in the context of creation from chaos. The observed phenomenon seen in reality is that nothing moves by itself. In other words, motion is not self-caused; thus, the Classic Greek thinkers argued that the cosmos must have had a "prime mover" ''primum movens''. However, this scientific observation of ''motion'' does not logically extend to the idea of ''existence'', and therefore does not necessarily indicate creation from absolutely nothing.

In theology, ''ex nihilo'' creation states that there was a beginning to one's existence, and anything that exists has a beginning. This idea of a ''required beginning'' appears to contradict the proposed creator who existed ''without a beginning''. In other words, people are considered to be contingent beings, and their existence depends upon a non-contingent being. However, if non-contingency is possible, then there is no basis for arguing that contingency is required for existence, nor can it be logically concluded that the number of non-contingent beings or non-contingent things is limited to one single substance or one single Being.

David Ray Griffin expressed his thoughts on this as follows: <blockquote>"No special philosophical problems are raised by this view: If it is intelligible to hold that the existence of God requires no explanation, since something must exist necessarily and "of itself," then it is not unintelligible to hold that that which exists necessarily is God ''and'' a realm of non-divine actualities."<ref>cite web|url= http://www.anthonyflood.com/griffincreationoutofchaos.htm |title= David Ray Griffin "Creation Out of Chaos and the Problem of Evil" |publisher= Anthonyflood.com |accessdate= 2013-08-01</ref></blockquote>

Bruce K. Waltke wrote an extensive Biblical study of creation theology in which he argues for creation from chaos rather than from nothing - based on the Hebrew Torah and the New Testament texts.

Thomas Jay Oord, a Christian philosopher and theologian, argues that Christians should abandon the doctrine of creation ''ex nihilo''. Oord points to the work of biblical scholars such as Jon D. Levenson, who points out that the doctrine of ''creatio ex nihilo'' does not appear in Book of Genesis|Genesis. Oord speculates that God created our particular universe billions of years ago from primordial chaos. This chaos, however, did not predate God, for God would have created the chaotic elements as well.<ref name="books.google.com">cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=DsPwO1YDeNIC&pg=PA240&dq=Thomas+Jay+Oord |title= Face of the Deep: A Theology of Becoming - Catherine Keller - Google Boeken |accessdate= 2012-06-20</ref>Page needed|date= September 2010 Oord suggests that God can create all things without creating from absolute nothingness.<ref>

Oord offers nine objections to ''creatio ex nihilo'':<ref>cite web|url= http://thomasjayoord.com/index.php/blog/archives/creatio_ex_nihilo_the_problem/#.UQDtUOgRkeM |title= Creatio Ex Nihilo: The Problem · For The Love of Wisdom and The Wisdom of Love · Thomas Jay Oord |publisher= Thomasjayoord.com |accessdate= 2013-08-01|date= 2010-01-19 </ref>
# Theoretical problem: One cannot conceive absolute nothingness.
# Biblical problem: Scripture – in Genesis, 2 Peter, and elsewhere – suggests creation from something (water, deep, chaos, etc.), not creation from absolutely nothing.
# Historical problem: The Gnosticism|Gnostics Basilides and Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus first proposed ''creatio ex nihilo'' on the basis of assuming the inherently evil nature of creation, and in the belief that God does not act in history.  Early Christian theologians adopted the idea to affirm the kind of absolute divine power that many Christians now reject.
# Empirical problem: We have no evidence that our universe originally came into being from absolutely nothing.
# Creation-at-an-instant problem:  We have no evidence in the history of the Universe after the big bang that entities can emerge instantaneously from absolute nothingness.  As the earliest philosophers noted, out of nothing comes nothing (''Nothing comes from nothing|ex nihilo, nihil fit'').
# Solitary power problem: ''Creatio ex nihilo'' assumes that a powerful God once acted alone.  But power, as a social concept, only becomes meaningful in relation to others.
# Errant revelation problem: The God with the capacity to create something from absolutely nothing would apparently have the power to guarantee an unambiguous and inerrant message of salvation (for example: Biblical inerrancy|inerrant Bible).  An unambiguously clear and inerrant divine revelation does not exist.
# Problem of Evil: If God once had the power to create from absolutely nothing, God essentially retains that power.  But a God of love with this capacity appears culpability|culpable for failing to prevent evil.
# Empire Problem: The kind of divine power implied in ''creatio ex nihilo'' supports a theology of empire, based upon unilateral force and control of others.

Process theology|Process theologians argue that humans have always related a God to some "world" or another. They<ref>cite web|title= Creation Out of Chaos and the Problem of Evil by David Ray Griffin|url= http://www.anthonyflood.com/griffincreationoutofchaos.htm</ref> also claim that rejecting ''creatio ex nihilo'' provides the opportunity to affirm that God has everlastingly created and related with some realm of non-divine actualities or another (compare continuous creation). According to this alternative God-world theory, no non-divine thing exists without the creative activity of God, and nothing can terminate God's necessary existence.

Some non-trinitarian Christian churches do not teach the ''ex nihilo'' doctrine:
* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) teaches that Jehovah (whom they identify as the heavenly form of Jesus|Jesus Christ), under the direction of God the Father, organized this world and others like it out of eternal, pre-existing materials.<ref>cite web|title= Jesus Christ|url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/jesus-christ?lang=eng|work= The Guide to the Scriptures|publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate= 2012-01-25</ref><ref>cite journal|author= Bruce R.

They distinguish Jehovah from Jesus Christ, teaching that before he created the physical universe, Jehovah created Jesus and that Michael is the heavenly form of Jesus.

GK III.23 notes for instance that the ''sruti'' equally upholds the view that creation occurs from a pre-existent being (''sat'') and that it proceeds from non-existence. creation is most frequently understood to be a transformation (''parinama'') or an emanation from a pre-existent reality. Creation from non-being (''asat''), however, is put forward as a possibility in ''Chandogya Upanisad'' III.19 and ''Taittiriya Upanisad'' II.7. This is not necessarily a ''creatio ex nihilo'', but in all likelihood denotes an emergence of being from the pregnant and undifferentiated chaos known as non-being (''asat''). Nevertheless, the equating of non-being with nothingness may have been intended and it is certainly criticized on those grounds in ''Chandogya Upanisad'' VI.2. The predominant Brahmanical creation theme, however, describes an emanation from or transformation of "''sat''," whether envisaged as an abstract impersonal reality as in ''Taittiriya Upanisad'' II.i, or from a personal creator, as in ''Prasna Upanisad'' I.4.

Most philosophical schools in Hinduism maintain that material creation started with some minute particle (or seed) which had to be co-eternal or a part of ultimate reality (Brahman). This minute starting point is also the point into which all creation contracts at the end of each cycle. This concept varies between various traditions, such as the Vishishtadvaita tradition (which asserts that the Universe forms a part of God, created from some aspect of His divinity) and Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta traditions (which state that the minute initial particle (shuddha Maya) has always existed and was never created).

Scholars have suggested alternative translations from the Biblical Hebrew for the concept often rendered as "created" in English-language versions of Genesis 1. Van Volde, for example, suggests that the Genesis account tells of the "separation" of existing material rather than of creation ''ex nihilo''.<ref>

Note that ordinary language may lack a concise definitive native expression for "creation ''ex nihilo''" - hence the need for the technical Latinate phrase itself. The English-language word "create" itself comes from the Latin ''creare'' (to make, bring forth, produce, beget), with a root cognate with ''crescere'' (to arise, to grow) and allied to the English word ''crescent'' (originally meaning "growing").<ref>OEtymD| create | accessdate=2017-04-16
