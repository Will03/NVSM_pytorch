The North American X-15 was a Hypersonic speed|hypersonic rocket-powered aircraft operated by the United States Air Force and the NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration as part of the List of X-planes|X-plane series of experimental aircraft. The X-15 set speed and altitude records in the 1960s, reaching the Kármán line|edge of outer space and returning with valuable data used in aircraft and spacecraft design. The X-15's Flight airspeed record|official world record for the highest speed ever recorded by a manned, powered aircraft, set in October 1967 when William J. Knight flew Mach number|Mach 6.70 at convert|102100|ft|m|sigfig=4, a speed of convert|4520|mph|km/h m/s|0, has remained unbroken as of 2018.<ref name="nasa20140228">cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-052-DFRC.html |title=NASA Armstrong Fact Sheet: X-15 Hypersonic Research Program |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Yvonne |editor-last=Gibbs |date=28 February 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2015</ref><ref name="Fastest">cite web |url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/research/x15/ |title=North American X-15 High-Speed Research Aircraft |work=Aerospaceweb.org |year=2010 |accessdate=24 November 2008</ref>

During the X-15 program, 13 flights by eight pilots met the Air Force human spaceflight|spaceflight criterion by exceeding the altitude of convert|50|mi|km, thus qualifying these pilots as being astronauts. The Air Force pilots qualified for astronaut wings immediately, while the civilian pilots were eventually awarded NASA astronaut wings in 2005, 35 years after the last X-15 flight.  The only Navy pilot in the X-15 program never took the aircraft above the requisite 50 mile (80 km) altitude and thus never earned astronaut wings.sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=10<ref name="NASA">cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/aug/HQ_05233_X-15_pilots_honored.html |title=NASA Honors High Flying Space Pioneers |publisher=NASA |first1=Elvia H. |last1=Thompson |first2=Frederick A. |last2=Johnsen |date=23 August 2005 |id=Release 05-233</ref>

Design and development

The X-15 was based on a concept study from Walter Dornberger for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) for a Hypersonic speed|hypersonic research aircraft.sfn|Käsmann|1999|p=105 The Request for proposal|requests for proposal (RFPs) were published on 30 December 1954 for the airframe and on 4 February 1955 for the rocket engine. The X-15 was built by two manufacturers: North American Aviation was contracted for the airframe in November 1955, and Reaction Motors was contracted for building the engines in 1956.

Like many X-plane|X-series aircraft, the X-15 was designed to be carried aloft and drop test|drop launched from under the wing of a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 mother ship.  Air Force NB-52A, "The High and Mighty One" (serial 52-0003, a.k.a. ''Balls 3''), and NB-52B, "The Challenger" (serial 52-0008, a.k.a. ''Balls 8'') served as carrier planes for all X-15 flights.  Release took place at an altitude of about convert|8.5|mi|km and a speed of about convert|805|km/h|mph|order=flip|sp=us.<ref name="E-4942">cite web |url=http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Photo/X-15/HTML/E-4942.html |title=X-15 launch from B-52 mothership |publisher=Armstrong Flight Research Center |date=6 February 2002 |id=Photo E-4942</ref> The X-15 fuselage was long and cylindrical, with rear Aircraft fairing|fairings that flattened its appearance, and thick, dorsal and ventral wedge-fin stabilizers. Parts of the fuselage were heat-resistant nickel alloy (Inconel-X 750).sfn|Käsmann|1999|p=105 The retractable landing gear comprised a nose-wheel carriage and two rear skids. The skids did not extend beyond the ventral fin, which required the pilot to jettison the lower fin just before landing.  The lower fin was recovered by parachute.

=Cockpit and pilot systems=
File:North American X-15A-2 cockpit 2 USAF.jpg|thumb|left|Cockpit of an X-15
The X-15 was the product of developmental research and changes were made to various systems over the course of the program and between the different models. The X-15 was operated under several different scenarios, including attachment to a launch aircraft, drop, main engine start and acceleration, ballistic flight into thin air/space, re-entry into thicker air, unpowered glide to landing, and direct landing without a main-engine start. The main rocket engine operated only for a relatively short part of the flight, but boosted the X-15 to its high speeds and altitudes. Without main engine thrust, the X-15's instruments and control surfaces remained functional, but the aircraft could not maintain altitude.

Because the X-15 also had to be controlled in an environment where there was too little air for aerodynamic flight control surfaces, it had a reaction control system (RCS) that used rocket thrusters.<ref name=paul /> There were two different X-15 pilot control setups: one used three joysticks, the other, one joystick.<ref name=jarvis />

The X-15 type with multiple control sticks for the pilot placed a traditional rudder and stick between a left joystick that sent commands to the Reaction Control System,<ref name=paul2 /> and a third joystick on the right used during high-G maneuvers to augment the center stick.<ref name=paul2 /> In addition to pilot input, the X-15 "Stability Augmentation System" (SAS) sent inputs to the aerodynamic controls to help the pilot maintain attitude control.<ref name=paul2 />  The Reaction Control System (RCS) could be operated in two modes&nbsp;— manual and automatic.<ref name=jarvis /> The automatic mode used a feature called "Reaction Augmentation System" (RAS) that helped stabilize the vehicle at high altitude.<ref name=jarvis>cite book |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/87709main_H-364.pdf |title=Operational Experience With the X-15 Reaction Control and Reaction Augmentation Systems |publisher=NASA |first1=Calvin R. |last1=Jarvis |first2=Wilton P. |last2=Lock |year=1965 |id=TN D-2864 |oclc=703664750</ref>  The RAS was typically used for approximately three minutes of an X-15 flight before automatic power off.<ref name=jarvis />

The alternative control setup used the MH-96 flight control system, which allowed one joystick in place of three and simplified pilot input.<ref name=goleta>cite web |url=http://www.air-and-space.com/x-15%20forty%20years%20later%20200202.htm |title=Forty Years ago in the X-15 Flight Test Program, November 1961–March 1962 |publisher=Goleta Air & Space Museum |access-date=3 October 2011</ref> The MH-96 could automatically blend aerodynamic and rocket controls, depending on how effective each system was at controlling the aircraft.<ref name=goleta />

Among the many controls were the rocket engine throttle and a control for jettisoning the ventral tail fin.<ref name=paul2 /> Other features of the cockpit included heated windows to prevent icing and a forward headrest for periods of high deceleration.<ref name=paul2 />

The X-15 had an ejection seat designed to operate at speeds up to convert|4|Mach|120000 and/or convert|120000|ft|km altitude, although it was never used during the program.<ref name=paul2>cite web |url=http://www.sierrafoot.org/x-15/pirep2.html |title=X-15 Pilot Report, Part 2: X-15 Cockpit Check |work=SierraFoot.org |first=Paul |last=Raveling |access-date=1 October 2011</ref> In the event of ejection, the seat was designed to deploy fins, which were used until it reached a safer speed/altitude at which to deploy its main parachute.<ref name=paul2 /> Pilots wore pressure suits, which could be pressurized with nitrogen gas.<ref name=paul2 /> Above convert|35000|ft|km altitude, the cockpit was pressurized to convert|3.5|psi|atm|abbr=on with nitrogen gas, while oxygen for breathing was fed separately to the pilot.<ref name=paul2 />

=Propulsion=
File:North American X-15 Nozzle.jpg|thumb|right|X-15 tail with XLR-99
The initial 24 powered flights used two Reaction Motors XLR11 liquid-propellant rocket engines, enhanced to provide a total of convert|16000|lb-f|kN of thrust as compared to the convert|6000|lb-f|kN that a single XLR11 provided in 1947 to make the Bell X-1 the first aircraft to fly faster than the speed of sound.  The XLR11 used ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen.

By November 1960, Reaction Motors was able to deliver the Reaction Motors XLR99|XLR99 rocket engine, generating convert|57000|lb-f|kN of thrust. The remaining 175 flights of the X-15 used XLR99 engines, in a single engine configuration. The XLR99 used anhydrous ammonia and liquid oxygen as propellant, and hydrogen peroxide to drive the high-speed turbopump that delivered propellants to the engine.<ref name=paul /> It could burn convert|15000|lb|kg|0 of propellant in 80 seconds;<ref name=paul /> Jules Bergman titled his book on the program ''Ninety Seconds to Space'' to describe the total powered flight time of the aircraft.<ref name="gale196110">cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n01_1961-10#page/n173/mode/2up |title=Galaxy's 5-Star Shelf |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy Magazine |first=Floyd C. |last=Gale |volume=20 |issue=1 |page=174 |date=October 1961</ref>

The X-15 reaction control system (RCS), for maneuvering in low-pressure/density environment, used high-test peroxide (HTP), which decomposes into water and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst and could provide a specific impulse of 140 seconds.<ref name="jarvis" />sfn|Davies|2003|p=8.28 The HTP also fueled a turbopump for the main engines and auxiliary power units (APUs).<ref name=paul>cite web |url=http://www.sierrafoot.org/x-15/pirep1.html |title=X-15 Pilot Report, Part 1: X-15 General Description & Walkaround |work=SierraFoot.org |first=Paul |last=Raveling |access-date=30 September 2011</ref> Additional tanks for helium and liquid nitrogen performed other functions, for example the fuselage interior was purged with helium gas, and the liquid nitrogen was used as coolant for various systems.<ref name=paul />

Quote|A wedge shape was used because it is more effective than the conventional tail as a stabilizing surface at hypersonic speeds. A vertical-tail area equal to 60 percent of the wing area was required to give the X-15 adequate directional stability.|Wendell H. Stillwell|[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-60/ch-3.html X-15 Research Results (SP-60)]
Stability at hypersonic speeds was aided by side panels which could be extended from the tail to increase the overall surface area, and these panels doubled as air-brakes.<ref name=wendell />

Altitudes attained by X-15 aircraft fell short of those of Alan Shepard's and Gus Grissom's Project Mercury space capsules in 1961, or of any other manned spacecraft. However, the X-15 ranks supreme among manned rocket-powered aircraft, becoming the world's first operational spaceplane in the early 1960s.

Before 1958, United States Air Force (USAF) and NACA officials discussed an orbital X-15 spaceplane, the X-15B that would launch into outer space from atop an SM-64 Navaho missile.  This was canceled when the NACA became NASA and adopted Project Mercury instead.

By 1959, the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar space-glider program was to become the USAF's preferred means for launching military manned spacecraft into orbit. This program was canceled in the early 1960s before an operational vehicle could be built.sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=10  Various configurations of the Navajo were considered, and another proposal involved a Titan I stage.<ref name=wade/>

Three X-15s were built, flying 199 test flights, the last on 24 October 1968.

The first X-15 flight was an unpowered glide flight by Scott Crossfield, on 8 June 1959. Crossfield also piloted the first powered flight on 17 September 1959, and his first flight with the XLR-99 rocket engine on 15 November 1960. Twelve test pilots flew the X-15. Among these were Neil Armstrong, later a NASA astronaut and first man to set foot on the Moon, and Joe Engle, later a commander of Space Shuttle program|NASA Space Shuttle missions.

In a 1962 proposal, NASA considered using the B-52/X-15 as a launch platform for a Blue Scout rocket to place satellites weighing up to convert|150|lb|kg into orbit.<ref name="wade">cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/x15scout.htm |title=X-15/Blue Scout |work=Encyclopedia Astronautica |first=Mark |last=Wade |accessdate=30 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011061550/http://astronautix.com/lvs/x15scout.htm |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all</ref><ref name="cis20120321">cite web |url=http://www.citizensinspace.org/2012/03/historical-note-blue-scout-x-15/ |title=Historical note: Blue Scout / X-15 |work=Citizensinspace.org |date=21 March 2012</ref>

In July and August 1963, pilot Joseph A. Walker exceeded nowrap|100 km in altitude, joining NASA astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts as the first human beings to cross that line on their way to outer space.  The USAF awarded astronaut wings to anyone achieving an altitude of convert|50|mi|km, while the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI set the Kármán line|limit of space at convert|100|km|mi|1|sp=us.

On 15 November 1967, U.S. Air Force test pilot Major Michael J. Adams was killed during X-15 Flight 3-65-97|X-15 Flight 191 when X-15-3, AF Ser. No. 56-6672, entered a hypersonic spin while descending, then oscillated violently as aerodynamic forces increased after re-entry. As his aircraft's flight control system operated the control surfaces to their limits, acceleration built to convert|15|g0|lk=on|abbr=on vertical and convert|8.0|g0|lk=on|abbr=on lateral.  The airframe broke apart at convert|60000|ft|km altitude, scattering the X-15's wreckage for convert|50|sqmi|km2.  On 8 May 2004, a monument was erected at the cockpit's locale, near Randsburg, California.<ref name="xpress2004">cite journal |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/X-Press/stories/2004/073004/ppl_adams.html |title=Michael Adams: Remembering a Fallen Hero |journal=The X-Press |first=Peter W. |last=Merlin |volume=46 |issue=6 |date=30 July 2004</ref> Major Adams was posthumously awarded Air Force astronaut wings for his final flight in X-15-3, which had reached an altitude of convert|81.1|km|mi|order=flip|sp=us. In 1991, his name was added to the Space Mirror Memorial|Astronaut Memorial.<ref name="xpress2004" />

The second plane, X-15-2, was rebuilt after a landing accident on 9 November 1962 which damaged the craft and injured its pilot, John B. McKay|John McKay.  It was lengthened by convert|2.4|ft|cm, had a pair of auxiliary fuel tanks attached beneath its fuselage and wings, and a complete heat-resistant Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative coating was added. The plane was renamed the X-15A-2, and took flight for the first time on 25 June 1964. It reached its maximum speed of convert|7274|km/h|mph|order=flip|sp=us in October 1967 with pilot William "Pete" Knight of the U.S. Air Force in control.

Five principal aircraft were used during the X-15 program: three X-15 planes and two modified "nonstandard" Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|NB-52 bombers:
* nowrap|X-15-1 – ''56-6670'', 81 free flights
* nowrap|X-15-2 (later X-15A-2) – ''56-6671'', 31 free flights as X-15-2, 22 free flights as X-15A-2, and 53 in total

* nowrap|NB-52B – ''Balls 8|52-008'' nicknamed ''The Challenger'', later ''Balls 8'' (retired in November 2004)

Additionally, North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100, Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104 and Douglas F5D Skylancer|F5D Chase plane|chase aircraft and Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 and Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 transports supported the program.<ref>cite book |url=https://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/aero_x15_detail.html |title=X-15: Extending The Frontiers of Flight |publisher=NASA |last=Jenkins |first=Dennis R. |date=2010 |isbn=978-1-4700-2585-4</ref>

A 200th flight over Nevada was first scheduled for 21 November 1968, to be flown by William "Pete" Knight. Numerous technical problems and outbreaks of bad weather delayed this proposed flight six times, and it was permanently canceled on 20 December 1968. This X-15 was detached from the B-52 and then put into indefinite storage. The aircraft was later donated to the National Museum of the United States Air Force|Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for display.

Record flights

main|List of X-15 flights

=Highest flights=

Over thirteen flights, eight pilots flew above 264,000 feet or 50 miles, thereby qualifying as astronauts according to the United States definition of the space border.  All five Air Force pilots flew above 50 miles and were awarded military astronaut wings contemporaneously with their achievements, including Adams, who received the distinction posthumously following the flight 191 disaster.<ref>Jenkins (2000), Appendix 8, p. 117.</ref>  However the other three were NASA employees, and did not receive a comparable decoration at the time.  In 2004, the Federal Aviation Administration conferred its first-ever commercial astronaut wings on Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie, pilots of the commercial SpaceShipOne, another spaceplane with a flight profile comparable to the X-15's.  Following this in 2005, NASA retroactively awarded its civilian astronaut wings to Dana (then living), and to McKay and Walker (posthumously).<ref>cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/X-15_wings.html |title=X-15 Pioneers Honored as Astronauts |last=Johnsen |first=Frederick A. |date=23 August 2005 |website=NASA</ref><ref>cite web |url=https://www.space.com/1465-nasa-15-pilots-awarded-astronaut-wings.html |title=Former NASA X-15 Pilots Awarded Astronaut Wings |last=Pearlman |first=Robert Z. |date=23 August 2005 |website=space.com</ref>

Of the thirteen flights, only two—flights 90 and 91, piloted by Walker—exceeded the Kármán line, the internationally recognized 100 km altitude used by the FAI to denote the edge of space.
