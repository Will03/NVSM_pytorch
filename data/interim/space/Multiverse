 History of the concept 
In Dublin in 1952, Erwin Schrödinger gave a lecture in which he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might "seem lunatic". He said that when his equations seemed to describe several different histories, these were "not alternatives, but all really happen simultaneously".<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9188438/Erwin-Schrodinger-and-the-Quantum-Revolution-by-John-Gribbin-review.html "Erwin Schrödinger and the Quantum Revolution by John Gribbin: review"].</ref>

The American philosopher and psychologist William James used the term "multiverse" in 1895, but in a different context.<ref>James, William, ''The Will to Believe'', 1895; and earlier in 1895, as cited in OED's new 2003 entry for "multiverse": citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HA0MAAAAIAAJ&dq=Visible%20nature%20is%20all%20plasticity%20and%20indifference%2C%20a%20multiverse%2C%20as%20one%20might%20call%20it%2C%20and%20not%20a%20universe&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q=%22Visible%20nature%20is%20all%20plasticity%20and%20indifference,%20a%20multiverse,%20as%20one%20might%20call%20it,%20and%20not%20a%20universe%22&f=false|date=October 1895|last=James|first=William|journal=Internat.

 Brief explanation 
Multiple universes have been hypothesized in cosmology, physics, astronomy, religion, philosophy, transpersonal psychology, and literature, particularly in science fiction and fantasy. In these contexts, parallel universes are also called "alternate universes", "quantum universes", "interpenetrating dimensions", "parallel dimensions", "parallel worlds", "parallel realities", "quantum realities", "alternate realities", "alternate timelines", "alternate dimensions" and "dimensional planes".

The physics community has debated the various multiverse theories over time. Prominent physicists are divided about whether any other universes exist outside of our own.

Some physicists say the multiverse is not a legitimate topic of scientific inquiry.<ref>Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00033790903047725| title = Contemporary History of Cosmology and the Controversy over the Multiverse| journal = Annals of Science| volume = 66| issue = 4| pages = 529–551| year = 2009| last1 = Kragh | first1 = H. </ref> Concerns have been raised about whether attempts to exempt the multiverse from experimental verification could erode public confidence in science and ultimately damage the study of fundamental physics.<ref>cite journal |url= http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-defend-the-integrity-of-physics-1.16535 |title= Scientific Method: Defend the Integrity of Physics |last1= Ellis  |first1= George |last2=Silk |first2=Joe |date=16 December 2014   |journal= Nature |publisher=  |location=  |issn= |oclc= |doi=10.1038/516321a |volume=516 |issue= 7531 |pages=321–323|bibcode = 2014Natur.516..321E |pmid=25519115</ref> Some have argued that the multiverse is a philosophical rather than a Hypothesis|scientific hypothesis because it cannot be empirically falsifiability|falsified.

In 2007, Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg suggested that if the multiverse existed, "the hope of finding a rational explanation for the precise values of quark masses and other constants of the standard model that we observe in our Big Bang is doomed, for their values would be an accident of the particular part of the multiverse in which we live."<ref>cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/nov/07/physics-what-we-do-and-dont-know/|title= Physics: What we do and don't know  |last1= Weinberg  |first1= Steven |date= 20 November 2007 |magazine= The New York Review of Books |publisher=  |location= |issn= |oclc=</ref>

 Search for evidence 
Around 2010, scientists such as Stephen M. Feeney analyzed Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data and claimed to find evidence suggesting that our universe collided with other (parallel) universes in the distant past.<ref>cite web|title=Astronomers Find First Evidence Of Other Universe|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/421999/astronomers-find-first-evidence-of-other-universes/|work=|publisher=technologyreview.com|accessdate=12 October 2013|date=13 December 2010</ref><ref>cite web|title=The Case for Parallel Universes|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/multiverse-the-case-for-parallel-universe/|accessdate=12 October 2013|author=Max Tegmark|author2=Alexander Vilenkin|date=19 July 2011</ref><ref>cite web|title=Is Our Universe Inside a Bubble?

Hawking argued that string theory is unlikely to predict the distinctive features of the Universe. But neither is he is an advocate of God. He therefore opts for the last approach, favoring the type of multiverse which arises naturally within the context of his own work in quantum cosmology.</ref>

 Arguments against multiverse theories 
In his 2003 ''New York Times'' opinion piece, "A Brief History of the Multiverse", author and cosmologist Paul Davies offered a variety of arguments that multiverse theories are non-scientific:<ref>cite news |title=''A Brief History of the Multiverse'' |first=Paul |last=Davies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/12/opinion/a-brief-history-of-the-multiverse.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=12 April 2003 |accessdate=16 August 2011</ref> quotation|For a start, how is the existence of the other universes to be tested? To be sure, all cosmologists accept that there are some regions of the universe that lie beyond the reach of our telescopes, but somewhere on the slippery slope between that and the idea that there is an infinite number of universes, credibility reaches a limit. As one slips down that slope, more and more must be accepted on faith, and less and less is open to scientific verification. Extreme multiverse explanations are therefore reminiscent of theological discussions. Indeed, invoking an infinity of unseen universes to explain the unusual features of the one we do see is just as ad hoc as invoking an unseen Creator. The multiverse theory may be dressed up in scientific language, but in essence it requires the same leap of faith.|Paul Davies|''The New York Times''|"A Brief History of the Multiverse"

George F. R. Ellis|George Ellis, writing in August 2011, provided a criticism of the multiverse, and pointed out that it is not a traditional scientific theory. He accepts that the multiverse is thought to exist far beyond the List of cosmological horizons|cosmological horizon. He emphasized that it is theorized to be so far away that it is unlikely any evidence will ever be found. Ellis also explained that some theorists do not believe the lack of Empiricism|empirical testability falsifiability is a major concern, but he is opposed to that line of thinking: quotation|Many physicists who talk about the multiverse, especially advocates of the string landscape, do not care much about parallel universes per se. For them, objections to the multiverse as a concept are unimportant. Their theories live or die based on internal consistency and, one hopes, eventual laboratory testing.

Ellis says that scientists have proposed the idea of the multiverse as a way of explaining the nature of existence. He points out that it ultimately leaves those questions unresolved because it is a metaphysical issue that cannot be resolved by empirical science. He argues that observational testing is at the core of science and should not be abandoned:<ref name="SciAmer-9723382">cite magazine |first=George F.

 Classification schemes 
Max Tegmark and Brian Greene have devised classification schemes for the various theoretical types of multiverses and universes that they might comprise.

anchor|Tegmark's classification
Cosmology|Cosmologist Max Tegmark has provided a taxonomy (general)|taxonomy of universes beyond the familiar observable universe. The four levels of Tegmark's classification are arranged such that subsequent levels can be understood to encompass and expand upon previous levels. They are briefly described below.<ref>cite magazine | first=Max| last=Tegmark| magazine=Scientific American|date=May 2003| title=Parallel Universes| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0503-40| volume=288| pages=40–51| pmid=12701329| url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/604580|arxiv = astro-ph/0302131 |bibcode = 2003SciAm.288e..40T </ref><ref>cite book

 Level I: An extension of our Universe 
A prediction of chaotic inflation is the existence of an infinite ergodic hypothesis|ergodic universe, which, being infinite, must contain Hubble volumes realizing all initial conditions.

Accordingly, an infinite universe will contain an infinite number of Hubble volumes, all having the same physical laws and physical constants. In regard to configurations such as the distribution of matter, almost all will differ from our Hubble volume. However, because there are infinitely many, far beyond the cosmological horizon, there will eventually be Hubble volumes with similar, and even identical, configurations. Tegmark estimates that an identical volume to ours should be about Double exponential function|10<sup>10<sup>115</sup></sup> meters away from us.<ref name="X0302131"/>

Given infinite space, there would, in fact, be an infinite number of Hubble volumes identical to ours in the universe.<ref name="TegmarkPUstaple">"Parallel universes. Not just a staple of science fiction, other universes are a direct implication of cosmological observations.", Tegmark M., Sci Am. 2003 May;288(5):40–51.</ref> This follows directly from the cosmological principle, wherein it is assumed that our Hubble volume is not special or unique.

 Level II: Universes with different physical constants 
File:Multiverse - level II.svg|thumb|Eternal inflation|Bubble universes – every disk represents a bubble universe. Our universe is represented by one of the disks.<br>Universe 1 to Universe 6 represent bubble universes. Five of them have different physical constants than our universe has.
In the Eternal inflation|chaotic inflation theory, which is a variant of the Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation theory, the multiverse or space as a whole is stretching and will continue doing so forever,<ref>cite serial |title=How the Universe Works#Season 3|How The Universe Works 3|episode=First Second of the Big Bang |network=Science (TV network)|Discovery Science |date=2014</ref> but some regions of space stop stretching and form distinct bubbles (like gas pockets in a loaf of rising bread). Such bubbles are embryonic level I multiverses.

Different bubbles may experience different spontaneous symmetry breaking, which results in different properties, such as different physical constants.<ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"/>

Level II also includes John Archibald Wheeler's oscillatory universe theory and Lee Smolin's fecund universes theory.

 Level III: Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics 
Hugh Everett III's many-worlds interpretation (MWI) is one of several mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics.

In brief, one aspect of quantum mechanics is that certain observations cannot be predicted absolutely. Instead, there is a range of possible observations, each with a different probability. According to the MWI, each of these possible observations corresponds to a different universe. Suppose a six-sided dice is thrown and that the result of the throw corresponds to a quantum mechanics observable. All six possible ways the dice can fall correspond to six different universes.

Tegmark argues that a Level III multiverse does not contain more possibilities in the Hubble volume than a Level I or Level II multiverse. In effect, all the different "worlds" created by "splits" in a Level III multiverse with the same physical constants can be found in some Hubble volume in a Level I multiverse. Tegmark writes that, "The only difference between Level I and Level III is where your doppelgängers reside. In Level I they live elsewhere in good old three-dimensional space. In Level III they live on another quantum branch in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space."

Similarly, all Level II bubble universes with different physical constants can, in effect, be found as "worlds" created by "splits" at the moment of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a Level III multiverse.<ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"/> According to Yasunori Nomura,<ref name="Nomura"/> Raphael Bousso, and Leonard Susskind,<ref name="BoussoSusskind"/> this is because global spacetime appearing in the (eternally) inflating multiverse is a redundant concept. This implies that the multiverses of Levels I, II, and III are, in fact, the same thing. This hypothesis is referred to as "Multiverse = Quantum Many Worlds".

Related to the ''many-worlds'' idea are Richard Feynman's ''multiple histories'' interpretation and H. Dieter Zeh's many-minds interpretation|''many-minds'' interpretation.

 Level IV: Ultimate ensemble 
The ultimate mathematical universe hypothesis is Tegmark's own hypothesis.<ref name="Tegmark2014">cite book |first=Max |last=Tegmark |date=2014 |title=Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |isbn=9780307599803</ref>

This level considers all universes to be equally real which can be described by different mathematical structures.

Tegmark writes: quotation|Abstract mathematics is so general that any theory of everything|Theory Of Everything (TOE) which is definable in purely formal terms (independent of vague human terminology) is also a mathematical structure. For instance, a TOE involving a set of different types of entities (denoted by words, say) and relations between them (denoted by additional words) is nothing but what mathematicians call a Set theory|set-theoretical model, and one can generally find a formal system that it is a model of.

He argues that this "implies that any conceivable parallel universe theory can be described at Level IV" and "subsumes all other ensembles, therefore brings closure to the hierarchy of multiverses, and there cannot be, say, a Level V."<ref name="X0302131">Cite journal|last=Tegmark |first=Max |arxiv=astro-ph/0302131 |title=Parallel Universes |journal=In "Science and Ultimate Reality: from Quantum to Cosmos", honoring John Wheeler's th birthday.

Jürgen Schmidhuber, however, says that the set of mathematical structures is not even well-defined and that it admits only universe representations describable by constructive mathematics—that is, computer programs.

Schmidhuber explicitly includes universe representations describable by non-halting programs whose output bits converge after finite time, although the convergence time itself may not be predictable by a halting program, due to the Undecidable problem|undecidability of the halting problem.<ref>Jürgen Schmidhuber|J.

= Brian Greene's nine types =
anchor|Brian Greene's nine types of multiverses
The American theoretical physicist and Super-string theory|string theorist Brian Greene discussed nine types of multiverses:<ref>In The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos, 2011</ref>

 Quilted 
The quilted multiverse works only in an infinity|infinite universe. With an infinite amount of space, every possible event will occur an infinite number of times. However, the speed of light prevents us from being aware of these other identical areas.

 Inflationary 
The Eternal inflation|inflationary multiverse is composed of various pockets in which inflation fields collapse and form new universes.

 Brane 
The Brane cosmology|brane multiverse version postulates that our entire universe exists on a membrane (Brane multiverse|brane) which floats in a higher dimension or "bulk". In this bulk, there are other membranes with their own universes. These universes can interact with one another, and when they collide, the violence and energy produced is more than enough to give rise to a Big Bang|big bang. The branes float or drift near each other in the bulk, and every few trillion years, attracted by gravity or some other force we do not understand, collide and bang into each other. This repeated contact gives rise to multiple or "cyclic" Big Bang|big bangs. This particular hypothesis falls under the string theory umbrella as it requires extra spatial dimensions.

 Cyclic 
The cyclic model|cyclic multiverse has multiple branes that have collided, causing Big Bangs. The universes bounce back and pass through time until they are pulled back together and again collide, destroying the old contents and creating them anew.

 Landscape 
The String theory landscape|landscape multiverse relies on string theory's Calabi–Yau manifold|Calabi–Yau spaces. Quantum fluctuations drop the shapes to a lower energy level, creating a pocket with a set of laws different from that of the surrounding space.

 Quantum 
The Many-worlds interpretation|quantum multiverse creates a new universe when a diversion in events occurs, as in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

 Holographic 
The Holographic principle|holographic multiverse is derived from the theory that the surface area of a space can encode the contents of the volume of the region.

 Simulated 
The Simulated reality|simulated multiverse exists on complex computer systems that simulate entire universes.

 Ultimate 
The Mathematical universe hypothesis|ultimate multiverse contains every mathematically possible universe under different laws of physics.

= Cyclic theories =
main|Cyclic model
In several theories, there is a series of infinite, self-sustaining cycles (for example, an eternity of Big Bangs, Big Crunches, and/or Big Freezes).

 M-theory 
see also|Introduction to M-theory|M-theory|Brane cosmology|String theory landscape
A multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged within string theory and its higher-dimensional extension, Introduction to M-theory|M-theory.<ref>cite arXiv|eprint=hep-th/0511037v1|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=Living in the Multiverse|date=2005</ref>

These theories require the presence of 10 or 11 spacetime dimensions respectively. The extra 6 or 7 dimensions may either be compactified on a very small scale, or our universe may simply be localized on a dynamical (3+1)-dimensional object, a D3-brane. This opens up the possibility that there are other branes which could support other universes.<ref name="Richard J Szabo 2004">Richard J Szabo, ''An introduction to string theory and D-brane dynamics'' (2004)</ref><ref name="Maurizio Gasperini 2007">Maurizio Gasperini, ''Elements of String Cosmology'' (2007)</ref>

 Black-hole cosmology 
main|Black-hole cosmology
Black-hole Physical cosmology|cosmology is a cosmological model in which the observable universe is the interior of a black hole existing as one of possibly many universes inside a larger universe.citation needed|date=October 2017 This includes the theory of white holes, which are on the opposite side of space-time.

 Anthropic principle 
main|Anthropic principle
The concept of other universes has been proposed to explain how our Observable universe|own universe appears to be Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuned for Consciousness|conscious life as we experience it.

If there were a large (possibly infinite) number of universes, each with possibly different physical laws (or different dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constants), then some of these universes (even if very few) would have the combination of laws and fundamental parameters that are suitable for the development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, stars, and planets that can exist long enough for life to emerge and evolve.

The weak anthropic principle could then be applied to conclude that we (as conscious beings) would only exist in one of those few universes that Selection bias|happened to be finely tuned, permitting the existence of life with developed consciousness. Thus, while the probability might be extremely small that any particular universe would have the requisite conditions for life (Carbon chauvinism|as we understand life), those conditions do not require intelligent design as an explanation for the conditions in the Universe that promote our existence in it.

An early form of this reasoning is evident in Arthur Schopenhauer's 1844 work "Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens", where he argues that our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were significantly worse in any respect it could not continue to exist.<ref>Arthur Schopenhauer, "Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung," supplement to the 4th book "Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens". see also R.B. Haldane and J. Kemp's translation [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation/Supplements_to_the_Fourth_Book "On the Vanity and Suffering of Life"] pp 395-6</ref>

 Occam's razor 
Proponents and critics disagree about how to apply Occam's razor. Critics argue that to postulate an almost infinite number of unobservable universes, just to explain our own universe, is contrary to Occam's razor.<ref>cite book|last= Trinh |first= Xuan Thuan |title= Science & the Search for Meaning: Perspectives from International Scientists |editor= Staune, Jean |publisher= Templeton Foundation |location= West Conshohocken, PA |page= 186 |isbn= 1-59947-102-7 |date= 2006 </ref> However, proponents argue that in terms of Kolmogorov complexity the proposed multiverse is simpler than a single idiosyncratic universe.<ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"/>

For example, multiverse proponent Max Tegmark argues: quotation|[A]n entire Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble is often much simpler than one of its members. This principle can be stated more formally using the notion of algorithmic information content. The algorithmic information content in a number is, roughly speaking, the length of the shortest computer program that will produce that number as output. For example, consider the Set (mathematics)|set of all integers. Which is simpler, the whole set or just one number? Naively, you might think that a single number is simpler, but the entire set can be generated by quite a trivial computer program, whereas a single number can be hugely long. Therefore, the whole set is actually simpler... (Similarly), the higher-level multiverses are simpler. Going from our universe to the Level I multiverse eliminates the need to specify initial conditions, upgrading to Level II eliminates the need to specify physical constants, and the Level IV multiverse eliminates the need to specify anything at all... A common feature of all four multiverse levels is that the simplest and arguably most elegant theory involves parallel universes by default. To deny the existence of those universes, one needs to complicate the theory by adding experimentally unsupported processes and ad hoc postulates: finite space, Wavefunction collapse|wave function collapse and ontological asymmetry. Our judgment therefore comes down to which we find more wasteful and inelegant: many worlds or many words. Perhaps we will gradually get used to the weird ways of our cosmos and find its strangeness to be part of its charm.<ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"/><ref>cite magazine | last1 = | first1 =  | date = May 2003 | title = Parallel universes.
