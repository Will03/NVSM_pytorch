Women of many nationalities have worked in space. The first woman in space, Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, flew in 1963. Space flight programs were slow to employ women, and only began to include them from the 1980s. Most women in space have been United States citizens, with missions on the Space Shuttle and on the International Space Station. Three countries maintain active space programs that include women: China, Russia, and the United States of America. In addition, a number of other countries — Canada, France, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom — have sent women into orbit or space on Russian or US missions.

Women in space face many of the same challenges faced by men: physical difficulties posed by non-Earth conditions and psychological stresses of isolation and separation. Scientific studies on female amphibians and non-human mammals generally show no adverse effect from short space missions, although the effect of extended space travel on human female reproduction is not known.

And while a number of American women underwent the astronaut selection process in the early 1960s - and passed - they were not eligible to be astronauts: All astronauts were required to be military test pilots, a career not available to women at the time.<ref name=flats>cite web|last1= Weitekamp  |first1=Margaret A. |last2=Garber |first2=Steve |url=https://history.nasa.gov/flats.html |title=Lovelace’s Woman in Space Program |publisher=NASA </ref>

NASA opened the space program to female applicants in 1978, in response to the new anti-discrimination laws of the time.

The first woman in space was a Soviet cosmonaut. Valentina Tereshkova launched with the Vostok 6 mission on June 16, 1963. The first woman to walk in space was also a cosmonaut: Svetlana Savitskaya was on her second mission when she space-walked on July 17, 1984 as part of Salyut 7-EP2.

Svetlana Savitskaya was the first woman to go on extravehicular activity (EVA) — after launching on Soyuz T-12 on July 25, 1984 — and the second woman overall to go into space.<ref name=WomenInSpace-NASA>cite web | url = https://history.nasa.gov/women.html | title = Women in Space | work = NASA History Program Office | first = Stephen | last = Garber | origyear = July 6, 2015 |date= July 2017 | publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | access-date = March 5, 2018</ref>

In addition to U.S. citizens, US rockets have launched international astronauts. Roberta Bondar (in 1992) and Julie Payette (in 1999 and 2009) from Canada, Kalpana Chawla of India (1997 and 2003), and Chiaki Mukai (in 1994 and 1998) and Naoko Yamazaki (in 2010) of Japan flew as part of the US space program.

A number of other high-profile women have contributed to interest in space programs. In the early 2000s, Lori Garver initiated a project to increase the visibility and viability of commercial spaceflight with the "AstroMom" project. She aimed to fill an unused Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz seat bound for the International Space Station because "…creating a spacefaring civilization was one of the most important things we could do in our lifetime.”<ref name=foust>cite web | url = http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1003/1 | first = Jeff | last = Foust | title = AstroMom and Basstronaut, revisited | date = November 19, 2007 | publisher = The Space Review</ref>

Radiation shielding has been noted as an issue for space colonization because children of female astronauts could be sterile if the astronaut were exposed to too much ionizing radiation during the later stages of a pregnancy.<ref name=tay/> Ionizing radiation may destroy the egg cells of a female fetus inside a pregnant woman, rendering the offspring infertile even when grown.<ref name=tay>cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/why-infertility-will-stop-humans-colonising-space-2213861.html | first = Jerome | last = Taylor | title = Why infertility will stop humans colonising space | newspaper = The Independent | date = February 14, 2011</ref>

The lack of knowledge about pregnancy and birth control in micro-gravity has been noted in regards to conducting long-term space missions.<ref name=Foster-139/>

Like modern space-travel, air travel exposes people on aircraft to increased radiation from space as compared to sea level, including cosmic rays and from solar flare events.<ref name=davis/>

The United States FAA requires airlines to provide flight crew with information about cosmic radiation, and an International Commission on Radiological Protection recommendation for the general public is no more than 1&nbsp;mSv per year.<ref name=davis/> In addition, many airlines do not allow pregnancy|pregnant flightcrew members, to comply with a European Directive.<ref name=davis/> The FAA has a recommended limit of 1&nbsp;mSv total for a pregnant woman, and no more than 0.5&nbsp;mSv per month.<ref name=davis/>

Massive particles are a concern for astronauts outside the earth's magnetic field who receive solar particles from solar proton events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays from cosmic sources. These high-energy charged nuclei are blocked by Earth's magnetic field but pose a Health threat from cosmic rays|major health concern for astronauts traveling to the moon and to any distant location beyond the earth orbit. Highly charged HZE ions in particular are known to be extremely damaging, although protons make up the vast majority of galactic cosmic rays. Evidence indicates past SPE radiation levels that would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142|title=Superflares could kill unprotected astronauts| first = Stephen | last = Battersby | work = New Scientist | publisher =  Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 March 2005</ref>

A trip to Mars with current technology might be related measurements by the Mars Science Laboratory which for a 180-day journey estimated an exposure approximately 300 mSv, which would be  equivalent of 24 CT scan|CAT scans or "15 times an annual radiation limit for a worker in a nuclear power plant".<ref>cite magazine | url = http://www.space.com/24731-mars-radiation-curiosity-rover.html | title = Calculated Risks: How Radiation Rules Manned Mars Exploration | first = Sheyna E. | last = Gifford | magazine = Astrobiology Magazine | publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | date = February 18, 2014 | access-date = January 7, 2017</ref> German standards for pregnant woman set a limit of 50 mSv/year for the gonads (ovaries) and uterus, and 150 mSv/year for the breasts.<ref>cite web | url = https://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/r/radiation-exposure-dose-limit.htm | title = Radiation exposure, dose limits, Germany | work = Glossary of nuclear terms | first = Winfried | last = Koelzer| publisher = European Nuclear Society | date = January 2011 | access-date = January 7, 2017</ref> For pregnant woman, radiation increases the risk of childhood cancers for the fetus.<ref>citation | url = http://www.aci.health.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/174552/MI-Clinician-Factsheet.pdf | format = PDF | title = Radiology Clinician Fact Sheet: Radiation Information | publisher = NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation | date = September 2012 | access-date = January 7, 2017</ref>

One of the problems with radiation exposure from spaceflight for pregnant women is that children they bear might not themselves be able to have children.<ref name=tay/> When a child is still in the womb, the baby's developing reproductive organs are sensitive to radiation; a fetus of either gender could be rendered infertile.<ref name=tay/> The female fetus is vulnerable in that the eggs that develop while her mother is pregnant can be damaged, so if she has children, they could be infertile due to the exposure in their maternal grandmother's womb.<ref name=tay/>
