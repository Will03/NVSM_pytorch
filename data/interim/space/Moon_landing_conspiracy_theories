File:Apollo 11 Crew During Training Exercise - GPN-2002-000032.jpg|thumb|Astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong in NASA's training mockup of the Moon and lander module. Conspiracy theorists say that the films of the missions were made using sets similar to this training mockup.

Moon landing conspiracy theories claim that some or all elements of the Apollo program and the associated Moon landings were hoaxes staged by NASA, possibly with the aid of other organizations. The most notable claim is that the List of Apollo missions#Manned Apollo missions|six manned landings (1969–72) were faked and that List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|12 Apollo astronauts did not actually walk on the Moon. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions, Moon rock samples, and even killing some key witnesses.

Conspiracy theory|Conspiracists have managed to sustain public interest in their theories for more than 40 years, despite the rebuttals and third-party evidence. Opinion polls taken in various locations have shown that between 6% and 20% of Americans, 25% of Britons, and 28% of Russians surveyed believe that the manned landings were faked. Even as late as 2001, the Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox television network documentary ''Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?'' claimed NASA faked the first landing in 1969 to win the Space Race.<ref name="greatmoonhoax">cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast23feb_2/ |title=The Great Moon Hoax |last=Phillips |first=Tony |date=February 23, 2001 |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 30, 2012</ref>

 Claimed motives of the United States and NASA 
Those who believe the Moon landings were faked give several theories about the motives of NASA and the Federal government of the United States|United States government. The three main theories are below.

= The Space Race =
Motivation for the United States to engage the Soviet Union in a Space Race can be traced to the then on-going Cold War. Landing on the Moon was viewed as a national and technological accomplishment that would generate world-wide acclaim.

The American Patriot Friends Network claimed in 2009 that the landings helped the United States government distract public attention from the unpopular Role of the United States in the Vietnam War#Americanization|Vietnam War, and so manned landings suddenly ended about the same time that the United States ended its involvement in the war.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.apfn.org/apfn/moon.htm |title=Was The Apollo Moon Landing Fake? |date=July 21, 2009 |website=American Patriot Friends Network (APFN) |publisher=APFN.org |accessdate=November 25, 2008</ref> In fact, the ending of the landings was not "sudden" (see The Space Race above).

 Hoax claims and rebuttals
Many Moon-landing conspiracy theories have been put forward, claiming either that the landings did not happen and that NASA employees have lied, or that the landings did happen but not in the way that has been told. Conspiracists have focused on perceived gaps or inconsistencies in the historical record of the missions. The foremost idea is that the whole manned landing program was a hoax from start to end. Some claim that the technology to send men to the Moon was lacking or that the Van Allen radiation belts, solar flares, solar wind, coronal mass ejections and cosmic rays made such a trip impossible.<ref name=k-pg7>#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002, p. 7–8</ref>

Vince Calder and Andrew Johnson, scientists from Argonne National Laboratory, have given detailed answers to  conspiracists' claims on the laboratory's website.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen01/gen01278.htm |last1=Calder |first1=Vince |last2=Johnson |first2=Andrew, P.E.|last3=ProfHoff 503 |title=Ask A Scientist|date=October 12, 2002|work=Newton |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |accessdate=August 14, 2009 |display-authors=2</ref> They show that NASA's portrayal of the Moon landing is fundamentally accurate, allowing for such common mistakes as mislabeled photos and imperfect personal recollections. Using the scientific process, any hypothesis that is contradicted by the observable facts may be rejected. The 'real landing' hypothesis is a single story since it comes from a single source, but there is no unity in the hoax hypothesis because hoax accounts vary between conspiracists.<ref>#Ramsay|Ramsay 2006 (page needed)</ref>

= Number of conspirators involved =
According to James Longuski (Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering at Purdue University), the conspiracy theories are impossible because of their size and complexity. The conspiracy would have to involve more than 400,000 people who worked on the Apollo project for nearly ten years, the 12 men who walked on the Moon, the six others who flew with them as Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module pilots, and another six astronauts who orbited the Moon.<ref group=Note>This number includes the crews of Apollos 8, Apollo 10|10, and Apollo 13|13, though the latter technically only performed a fly-by. These three missions account for only six additional astronauts because James Lovell orbited the Moon twice (Apollos 8 and 13) and John Young and Gene Cernan orbited on Apollo 10 both later landed on the Moon.</ref> Hundreds of thousands of people – including astronauts, scientists, engineers, technicians, and skilled laborers – would have had to keep the secret. Longuski argues that it would have been much easier to really land on the Moon than to generate such a huge conspiracy to fake the landings.<ref>#Longuski|Longuski 2006, p. 102</ref><ref>#Aaronovitch|Aaronovitch 2010, pp. 1–2, 6</ref> To date, nobody from the United States government or NASA linked to the Apollo program has said the Moon landings were hoaxes. Penn Jillette made note of this in the "Conspiracy Theories" episode of his television show ''Penn & Teller: Bullshit!'' in 2005.<ref name="bullshit">cite episode |title=Conspiracy Theories |series=Penn & Teller: Bullshit! |network=Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime |airdate=May 9, 2005 |season=3 |number=3</ref> With the number of people involved, and noting the Watergate scandal, Jillette noted that ''someone'' would have outed the hoax by now.

= Photographic and film oddities =
Main|Examination of Apollo Moon photographs

Moon-landing conspiracists focus heavily on NASA photos. They point to oddities in photos and films taken on the Moon. Photography experts (including those unrelated to NASA) have replied that the oddities are consistent with what should be expected from a real Moon landing, and are not consistent with tweaked or studio imagery. Some main arguments and counter-arguments are listed below.

1. In some photos, the Reticle|crosshairs appear to be behind objects. The cameras were fitted with a Réseau plate (a clear glass plate with a reticle etched on), making it impossible for any photographed object to appear "in front" of the grid. Conspiracists often use this evidence to suggest that objects were "pasted" over the photographs, and hence obscure the reticle.

:* ''This effect only appears in copied and scanned photos, not any originals. It is caused by overexposure: the bright white areas of the emulsion "bleed" over the thin black crosshairs. The crosshairs are only about 0.004 inches thick (0.1 mm) and emulsion would only have to bleed about half that much to fully obscure it. Furthermore, there are many photos where the middle of the crosshair is "washed-out" but the rest is intact. In some photos of the American flag, parts of one crosshair appear on the red stripes, but parts of the same crosshair are faded or invisible on the white stripes. There would have been no reason to "paste" white stripes onto the flag.<ref name="clavius-crosshairs">cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/photoret.html |title=Clavius: Photography – Crosshairs |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013</ref>

2. Crosshairs are sometimes rotated or in the wrong place.

:* ''This is a result of popular photos being cropped and/or rotated for aesthetic impact.''<ref name="clavius-crosshairs" />

3. The quality of the photographs is implausibly high.

4. There are no stars in any of the photos; the Apollo 11 astronauts also stated in post-mission press conferences that they did not remember seeing any stars during Extravehicular activity|EVA.<ref>#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002, pp. 20, 21, 22, 23</ref> Conspiracists contend that NASA chose not to put the stars into the photograph|photos because astronomers would have been able to use them to determine whether the photos were taken from the Earth or the Moon, by means of identifying them and comparing their celestial position and parallax to what would be expected for either observation site.

:* ''The astronauts were talking about naked-eye sightings of stars during the lunar daytime. They regularly sighted stars through the spacecraft navigation optics while aligning their inertial reference platforms, the Apollo PGNCS.''<ref>cite web |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-AOTNavStarsDetents.html |title=Navigation Stars used in the AOT |last1=Jones |first1=Eric M. |date=January 21, 2012 |website=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2014</ref>

:* ''Stars are rarely seen in Space Shuttle, Mir, Earth observation photos, or even photos taken at sporting events held at night. The light from the Sun in outer space in the Earth-Moon system is at least as bright as the sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface on a clear day at noon, so cameras used for imaging subjects illuminated by sunlight are set for a Sunny 16 rule|daylight exposure. The dim light of the stars simply does not provide enough Exposure (photography)|exposure to record visible images. All manned landings happened during the lunar daytime. Thus, the stars were outshone by the sun and by sunlight reflected off the Moon's surface. The astronauts' eyes were adapted to the sunlit landscape around them so that they could not see the relatively faint stars.<ref>cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2011/09/28/where-are-the-stars/ |title=Where are the stars? |last=Carlowicz |first=Mike |date=September 28, 2011 |work=NASA Earth Observatory |publisher=NASA |type=Blog |accessdate=April 20, 2013</ref><ref>#Plait|Plait 2002, pp. 158–60</ref> The astronauts could see stars with the naked eye only when they were in the shadow of the Moon.''<ref>#Woods|Woods 2008, pp. 206–07</ref><ref>#Harrison|Harrison 2012, pp. 95–96</ref>

:* ''Camera settings can turn a well-lit background to black when the foreground object is brightly lit, forcing the camera to increase shutter speed so that the foreground light does not wash out the image. A demonstration of this effect is here.<ref>:File:Lamp-and-moon-example-2.JPG</ref> The effect is similar to not being able to see stars from a brightly lit car park at night – the stars only become visible when the lights are turned off.

:* ''A special far ultraviolet camera, the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph, was taken to the lunar surface on Apollo 16 and operated in the shadow of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM). It took photos of Earth and of many stars, some of which are dim in visible light but bright in the ultraviolet. These observations were later matched with observations taken by orbiting ultraviolet telescopes.

5. The angle and color of shadows are inconsistent. This suggests that artificial lights were used.

:* ''Shadows on the Moon are complicated by reflected light, uneven ground, wide-angle lens distortion, and lunar dust. There are several light sources: the Sun, sunlight reflected from the Earth, sunlight reflected from the Moon's surface, and sunlight reflected from the astronauts and the Lunar Module. Light from these sources is scattered by lunar dust in many directions, including into shadows. Shadows falling into craters and hills may appear longer, shorter and distorted.<ref>#Plait|Plait 2002, pp. 167–72</ref> Furthermore, shadows display the properties of vanishing point perspective, leading them to converge to a point on the horizon.''
:* This theory was further debunked on the ''MythBusters'' episode "MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|NASA Moon Landing".

6. There are identical backgrounds in photos which, according to their captions, were taken miles apart. This suggests that a painted background was used.

:* ''Backgrounds were not identical, just similar. What appear as nearby hills in some photos are actually mountains many miles away. On Earth, objects that are further away will appear fainter and less detailed. On the Moon, there is no atmosphere or haze to obscure faraway objects, thus they appear clearer and nearer.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.iangoddard.com/moon01.htm |title=Goddard's Journal: Are Apollo Moon Photos Fake? |last=Goddard |first=Ian Williams |date=February 26, 2001 |website=Iangoddard.com |accessdate=November 25, 2008</ref> Furthermore, there are very few objects (such as trees) to help judge distance.

7. The number of photos taken is implausibly high.

:* ''Simplified gear with fixed settings allowed two photos a second. Many were taken immediately after each other as stereo pairs or panorama sequences. The calculation (one per 50 seconds) was based on a lone astronaut on the surface, and does not take into account that there were two astronauts sharing the workload and simultaneously taking photographs during an Extra-vehicular activity (EVA).''

8. The photos contain artifacts like the two seemingly matching 'C's on a rock and on the ground. These may be labeled studio props.

:* ''The "C"-shaped objects are most likely printing imperfections and do not appear in the original film from the camera. It has been suggested that the "C" is a coiled hair.<ref name="whomourns" /><ref>cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/rover1.html |title=Clavius: Photo Analysis – lunar rover |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=September 5, 2009</ref>

12. Who filmed Neil Armstrong stepping onto the Moon?

:* ''The Lunar Module did. While still on the Module's ladder steps, Armstrong deployed the Modularized Equipment Stowage Assembly from the side of the Lunar Module, unpacking, amongst other things, the TV camera. The TV camera was then powered on and a signal transmitted to the command module, which beamed the live signal back to Earth. This meant that upwards of 600 million people on Earth could watch the live feed with only a very slight delay. Similar technology was also used on subsequent Apollo missions.''

1. The astronauts could not have survived the trip because of exposure to radiation from the Van Allen radiation belt and galactic ambient radiation (see Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning and health threat from cosmic rays). Some conspiracists have suggested that Starfish Prime (a High-altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude nuclear test in 1962) was a failed attempt to disrupt the Van Allen belts.

:* ''There are two main Van Allen belts – the inner belt and the outer belt – and a transient third belt.<ref>cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/28feb_thirdbelt/ |title=Van Allen Probes Discover a New Radiation Belt |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |date=February 28, 2013 |editor-last=Phillips |editor-first=Tony |accessdate=May 8, 2013</ref> The inner belt is the more dangerous one, containing energetic protons.

2. Film in the cameras would have been fogged by this radiation.

:* ''The film was kept in metal containers that stopped radiation from fogging the film's emulsion.<ref>#Plait|Plait 2002, pp. 162–63</ref> Furthermore, film carried by unmanned lunar probes such as the Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter and Luna 3 (which used on-board film development processes) was not fogged.''

3. The Moon's surface during the daytime is so hot that camera film would have melted.

:* ''There is no atmosphere to efficiently bind lunar surface heat to devices (such as cameras) that are not in direct contact with it. In a vacuum, only radiation remains as a heat transfer mechanism. The physics of radiative heat transfer are thoroughly understood, and the proper use of passive optical coatings and paints was enough to control the temperature of the film within the cameras; Lunar Module temperatures were controlled with similar coatings that gave them a gold color. Also, while the Moon's surface does get very hot at lunar noon, every Apollo landing was made shortly after lunar sunrise at the landing site; the Lunar day|Moon's day is about frac|29|1|2 Earth days long, meaning that one Moon day (dawn to dusk) lasts nearly fifteen Earth days. During the longer stays, the astronauts did notice increased cooling loads on their spacesuits as the sun and surface temperature continued to rise, but the effect was easily countered by the passive and active cooling systems.<ref>#Plait|Plait 2002, pp. 165–67</ref> The film was not in direct sunlight, so it was not overheated.''<ref>cite web|url=http://www.clavius.org/envheat.html |title=Clavius: Environment – heat |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=November 25, 2008</ref>''

4. The Apollo 16 crew could not have survived a big solar flare firing out when they were on their way to the Moon.

:* ''No large solar flare occurred during the flight of Apollo 16. There were large solar flares in August 1972, after Apollo 16 returned to Earth and before the flight of Apollo 17.<ref>cite web |url=http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/27jan_solarflares/ |title=Sickening Solar Flares |last=Phillips |first=Tony |date=January 27, 2005 |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615021549/http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/27jan_solarflares/ |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all </ref><ref>cite news |title=Predicting Solar Eruptions |first=Selby |last=Cull |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/3422566.html?page=1&c=y |work=News from Sky & Telescope |publisher=Sky Publishing |date=July 12, 2006 |accessdate=November 25, 2008</ref>

5. The Lunar Flag Assembly|flag placed on the surface by the astronauts fluttered despite there being no wind on the Moon. This suggests that it was filmed on Earth and a breeze caused the flag to flutter. Sibrel said that it may have been caused by indoor fans used to cool the astronauts since their spacesuit cooling systems would have been too heavy on Earth.

:* ''The flag was fastened to a'' Г-''shaped rod (see Lunar Flag Assembly) so that it did not hang down. The flag only seemed to flutter when the astronauts were moving it into position. Without air drag, these movements caused the free corner of the flag to swing like a pendulum for some time. The flag was rippled because it had been folded during storage – the ripples could be mistaken for movement in a still photo. Videos show that when the astronauts let go of the flagpole it vibrates briefly but then remains still''.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/envflutter.html |title=Clavius: Environment: fluttering flags |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013</ref><ref>#Harrison|Harrison 2012, p. 97</ref><ref>#McAdams|McAdams 2011, p. 132</ref>

6. Footprints in the Moondust are unexpectedly well preserved, despite the lack of moisture.

:* ''Moondust has not been weathered like Earth sand and has sharp edges. This allows the dust particles to stick together and hold their shape in the vacuum. The astronauts likened it to "talcum powder or wet sand".''<ref name="whomourns" />
:* This theory was further debunked on the ''MythBusters'' episode "MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|NASA Moon Landing".

7. The alleged Moon landings used either a sound stage or were filmed outside in a remote desert with the astronauts either using harnesses or slow-motion photography to make it look like they were on the Moon.

:* ''While the HBO miniseries "From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon", and a scene from the movie "Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13" used the sound-stage and harness setup, it is clearly seen from those films that when dust rose it did not quickly settle; some dust briefly formed clouds. In the film footage from the Apollo missions, dust kicked up by the astronauts' boots and the wheels of the Lunar Roving Vehicles rose quite high due to the lower lunar gravity, and settled quickly to the ground in an uninterrupted parabolic arc since there was no air to suspend the dust. Even if there had been a sound stage for hoax Moon landings that had the air pumped out, the dust would have reached nowhere near the height and trajectory as in the Apollo film footage because of Earth's greater gravity.

:* ''During the Apollo 15 mission, David Scott did an experiment by dropping a hammer and a falcon feather at the same time. Both fell at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time. This proved that he was in a vacuum.<ref>Cite APOD |title=Hammer Versus Feather on the Moon |date=November 1, 2011 |access-date=April 20, 2013 Source for video: YouTube|id=4mTsrRZEMwA|title="The Hammer and the Feather"</ref>

:* ''If the landings were filmed outside in a desert, heat waves would be present on the surface in mission videos, but no such heat waves exist in the footage. If the landings were filmed in a sound stage, several anomalies would occur, including a lack of parallax, and an increase or decrease in the size of the backdrop if the camera moved (footage was filmed while the rover was in motion, and yet no evidence of any change in the size of the background is present).

1. The Lunar Modules made no blast Explosion crater|craters or any sign of dust scatter.<ref>#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002, p. 75</ref>

:* ''No crater should be expected. The 10,000-pound thrust Descent Propulsion System was throttled very far down during the final landing.<ref>#Harrison|Harrison 2012, p. 96</ref> The Lunar Module was no longer quickly decelerating, so the descent engine only had to support the lander's own weight, which was lessened by the Moon's gravity and by the near exhaustion of the descent propellants. At landing, the engine thrust divided by the nozzle exit area is only about 10 Pascal (unit)|kilopascals (1.5 Pounds per square inch|PSI).<ref>#Plait|Plait 2002, p. 164</ref> Beyond the engine nozzle, the plume spreads, and the pressure drops very quickly. Rocket exhaust gasses expand much more quickly after leaving the engine nozzle in a vacuum than in an atmosphere. The effect of an atmosphere on rocket plumes can be easily seen in launches from Earth; as the rocket rises through the thinning atmosphere, the exhaust plumes broaden very noticeably. To lessen this, rocket engines made for vacuums have longer bells than those made for use on Earth, but they still cannot stop this spreading. The lander's exhaust gasses, therefore, expanded quickly well beyond the landing site. The descent engines <u>did</u> scatter a lot of very fine surface dust as seen in 16 mm film|16mm movies of each landing, and many mission commanders spoke of its effect on visibility. The landers were generally moving horizontally as well as vertically, and photos do show scouring of the surface along the final descent path. Finally, the lunar regolith is very compact below its surface dust layer, making it impossible for the descent engine to blast out a "crater".<ref name=ba-pg163-165>#Plait|Plait 2002, pp. 163–65</ref> A blast crater was measured under the Apollo 11 lander using shadow lengths of the descent engine bell and estimates of the amount that the landing gear had compressed and how deep the lander footpads had pressed into the lunar surface and it was found that the engine had eroded between 4 and 6 inches of regolith out from underneath the engine bell during the final descent and landing.''<ref name="as11psr">cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/as11psr.pdf |title=Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report |year=1969 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |id=NASA SP-214 |accessdate=May 1, 2013</ref>

2. The second stage of the launch rocket and/or the Lunar Module Apollo Lunar Module#Ascent stage|ascent stage made no visible flame.

:* ''The Lunar Modules used Aerozine 50 (fuel) and dinitrogen tetroxide (oxidizer) propellants, chosen for simplicity and reliability; they ignite hypergolic propellant|hypergolically – upon contact – without the need for a spark. These propellants produce a nearly transparent materials|transparent exhaust.<ref>#Woods|Woods 2008, p. 191</ref> The same fuel was used by the core of the American Titan II GLV|Titan II rocket. The transparency of their plumes is apparent in many launch photos. The plumes of rocket engines fired in a vacuum spread out very quickly as they leave the engine nozzle (see above), further lessening their visibility. Finally, rocket engines often run "rich" to slow internal corrosion. On Earth, the excess fuel burns in contact with atmospheric oxygen, enhancing the visible flame. This cannot happen in a vacuum.''

4. The air conditioning units that were part of the astronauts' spacesuits could not have worked in an environment of no atmosphere.<ref name="cooper" />

:* ''The cooling units could <u>only</u> work in a vacuum. Water from a tank in the backpack flowed out through tiny pores in a metal Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimator plate where it quickly vaporized into space. The loss of the heat of vaporization froze the remaining water, forming a layer of ice on the outside of the plate that also sublimated into space (turning from a solid directly into a gas). A separate water loop flowed through the LCG (Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment|Liquid Cooling Garment) worn by the astronaut, carrying his metabolic waste heat through the sublimator plate where it was cooled and returned to the LCG. convert|12|lb|kg|spell=In of feedwater gave about eight hours of cooling; because of its bulk, it was often the limiting consumable on the length of an EVA.

1. There should have been more than a two-second delay in communications between Earth and the Moon, at a distance of convert|400000|km|mi|abbr=on.

:* ''The round trip light travel time of more than two seconds is apparent in all the real-time recordings of the lunar audio, but this does not always appear as expected. There may also be some documentary films where the delay has been edited out. Reasons for editing the audio may be time constraints or in the interest of clarity.''<ref>cite web|url=http://www.redzero.demon.co.uk/moonhoax/Radio.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729183941/http://www.redzero.demon.co.uk/moonhoax/Radio.htm |archivedate=July 29, 2008 |title=Radio Lag |publisher=Redzero.demon.co.uk |accessdate=November 25, 2008</ref>

2. Typical delays in communication were about 0.5 seconds.

:* ''Claims that the delays were only half a second are untrue, as examination of the original recordings shows. Also, there should not be a consistent time delay between every response, as the conversation is being recorded at one end – Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control. Responses from Mission Control could be heard without any delay, as the recording is being made at the same time that Houston receives the transmission from the Moon.''

3. The Parkes Observatory in Australia was billed to the world for weeks as the site that would be relaying communications from the first moonwalk. However, five hours before transmission they were told to stand down.

:* ''The timing of the first moonwalk was changed after the landing. In fact, delays in getting the moonwalk started meant that Parkes did cover almost the entire Apollo 11 moonwalk.''<ref>cite web |url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/imagery/apollo/AS11/a11sum.htm |title=Apollo 11 Mission Summary |website=The Apollo Program |publisher=National Air and Space Museum |date=July 16, 1969 |accessdate=November 13, 2010 |quote=From NASA SP-214, Preliminary Science Report</ref>

4. Parkes supposedly had the clearest video feed from the Moon, but Australian media and all other known sources ran a live feed from the United States.

:* ''While that was the original plan, and, according to some sources, the official policy, the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) did take the transmission direct from the Parkes and Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station|Honeysuckle Creek radio telescopes.

Dr. David R. Williams (NASA archivist at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 flight director Gene Kranz|Eugene F. Kranz both acknowledged that the original high-quality Apollo 11 telemetry data tapes are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed.<ref name="didwego" /> The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a slow-scan television (SSTV) camera (see Apollo TV camera). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a scan conversion had to be done. The radio telescope at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon at the time of the Apollo 11 moonwalk.<ref name="eagleswings2">cite journal |last=Sarkissian |first=John M. |title=On Eagle's Wings: The Parkes Observatory's Support of the Apollo 11 Mission |year=2001 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=287–310 |location=Collingwood, Victoria |publisher=CSIRO Publishing for the Astronomical Society of Australia |doi=10.1071/AS01038 |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |url=http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/|bibcode = 2001PASA...18..287S  October 2000 website version, part 1 of 12: "Introduction."

Others are looking for the missing telemetry tapes for different reasons. The tapes contain the original and highest quality video feed from the Apollo 11 landing. Some former Apollo personnel want to find the tapes for posterity while NASA engineers looking towards future Moon missions believe the tapes may be useful for their design studies. They have found that the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984, all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center at their request.

Bart Sibrel cites the relative level of the United States and USSR space technology as evidence that the Moon landings could not have happened. For much of the early stages of the Space Race, the USSR was ahead of the United States, yet in the end, the USSR was never able to fly a manned craft to the Moon, let alone land one on the surface. It is argued that, because the USSR was unable to do this, the United States should have also been unable to develop the technology to do so.

For example, he claims that, during the Apollo program, the USSR had five times more manned hours in space than the United States, and notes that the USSR was the first to achieve many of the early milestones in space: the first man-made satellite in orbit (October 1957, Sputnik 1);<ref group=Note>According to the 2007 ''Nova (TV series)|NOVA'' episode "List of Nova episodes#Season 35: 2007–2008|Sputnik Declassified," the United States could have launched the ''Explorer 1'' probe before Sputnik, but the Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration hesitated, first because they were not sure if international law meant that national borders kept going all the way into orbit (and, thus, their orbiting satellite could cause an international uproar by violating the borders of dozens of nations), and second because there was a desire to see the not yet ready Project Vanguard|Vanguard satellite program, designed by American citizens, become America's first satellite rather than the Explorer program, that was mostly designed by former rocket designers from Nazi Germany. A transcript of the appropriate section from the show is available at "[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/sputnik-impact-on-america.html Sputnik's Impact on America]."</ref> the first living creature in orbit (a dog named Laika, November 1957, Sputnik 2); the first man in space and in orbit (Yuri Gagarin, April 1961, Vostok 1); the first woman in space (Valentina Tereshkova, June 1963, Vostok 6); and the first spacewalk (EVA) (Alexei Leonov in March 1965, Voskhod 2).

However, most of the Soviet gains listed above were matched by the United States within a year, and sometimes within weeks. In 1965, the United States started to achieve many firsts (such as the first successful space rendezvous), which were important steps in a mission to the Moon. Furthermore, NASA and others say that these gains by the Soviets are not as impressive as they seem; that a number of these firsts were mere stunts that did not advance the technology greatly, or at all, ''e.g.'', the first woman in space.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/techsoviet.html |title=Clavius: Technology – beating the soviets |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=September 5, 2009</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/2013/06/17/women-in-space-part-one-female-firsts-in-flight-for-space-exploration-and-research/ |title=Women in Space Part One, Female Firsts in Flight for Space Exploration and Research |last=Warren |first=Liz |date=June 17, 2013 |work=A Lab Aloft |publisher=NASA Blogs |type=Blog |accessdate=July 18, 2013</ref> In fact, by the time of the launch of the first manned Earth-orbiting Apollo flight (Apollo 7), the USSR had made only nine spaceflights (seven with one cosmonaut, one with two, one with three) compared to 16 by the United States. In terms of spacecraft hours, the USSR had 460 hours of spaceflight; the United States had 1,024 hours. In terms of astronaut/cosmonaut time, the USSR had 534 hours of manned spaceflight whereas the United States had 1,992 hours. By the time of Apollo 11, the United States had a lead much wider than that. (See List of human spaceflights, 1961–1970, and refer to individual flights for the length of time.)

Two of the above, X-15 pilot Mike Adams and MOL pilot Robert Lawrence, had no connection with the civilian manned space program that oversaw the Apollo missions. All of the deaths listed besides Welch occurred at least 20 months ''before'' Apollo 11 and subsequent flights.

The number of deaths within the American astronaut corps during the run-up to Apollo and during the Apollo missions is similar to the number of deaths incurred by the Russians. During the period 1961 to 1972, at least eight Russian serving and former cosmonauts died:
* Valentin Bondarenko (ground training accident, March 1961)
* Grigori Nelyubov (suicide, February 1966)

Additionally, the overall chief of their manned-spaceflight program, Sergei Korolev, died while undergoing surgery in January 1966.

= NASA response =
In June 1977, NASA issued a fact sheet responding to recent claims that the Apollo Moon landings had been hoaxed.<ref>cite web |url=ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/media/2001/lunar_landing.pdf |title=Did U.S. Astronauts Really Land on the Moon |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=February 14, 2001 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Reissue (June 1977) |format=PDF |accessdate=April 24, 2014</ref> The fact sheet is particularly blunt and regards the idea of faking the Moon landings to be preposterous and outlandish. NASA refers to the rocks and particles collected from the Moon as being evidence of the program's legitimacy, as they claim that these rocks could not have been formed under conditions on earth. NASA also notes that all of the operations and phases of the Apollo program were closely followed and under the scrutiny of the news media, from liftoff to splashdown. NASA responds to Bill Kaysing's book, ''We Never Went to the Moon'', by identifying one of his claims of fraud regarding the lack of a crater left on the Moon's surface by the landing of the lunar module, and refuting it with facts about the soil and cohesive nature of the surface of the Moon.

The fact sheet was reissued on February 14, 2001, the day before Fox television's broadcast of ''Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?'' The documentary reinvigorated the public's interest in conspiracy theories and the possibility that the Moon landings were faked, which has provoked NASA to once again defend its name.

= Alleged Stanley Kubrick involvement =

Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick is accused of having produced much of the footage for Apollos 11 and 12, presumably because he had just directed ''2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey'', which is partly set on the Moon and featured advanced special effects.<ref name="clydelewis" /> It has been claimed that when ''2001'' was in post-production in early 1968, NASA secretly approached Kubrick to direct the first three Moon landings. The launch and splashdown would be real but the spacecraft would stay in Earth orbit and fake footage broadcast as "live from the Moon." No evidence was offered for this theory, which overlooks many facts. For example, ''2001'' was released before the first Apollo landing and Kubrick's depiction of the Moon's surface differs greatly from its appearance in the Apollo footage. The movement of characters on the Moon in ''2001'' differs from that of the filmed movement of Apollo astronauts, and does not resemble an environment with 1/6 the gravity of Earth. Several scenes in ''2001'' show dust billowing as spacecraft landed, something that would not happen in the vacuum environment of the Moon. Kubrick did hire Frederick I. Ordway III|Frederick Ordway and Harry Lange (film designer)|Harry Lange, both of whom had worked for NASA and major aerospace contractors, to work with him on ''2001''. Kubrick also used some 50&nbsp;mm f/0.7 lenses that were left over from a batch made by Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss for NASA. However, Kubrick only got this lens for ''Barry Lyndon'' (1975). The lens was originally a still photo lens and needed changes to be used for motion filming.

The mockumentary based on this idea, ''Dark Side of the Moon (documentary)|Dark Side of the Moon'', could have fueled the conspiracy theory. This French mockumentary, directed by William Karel, was originally aired on Arte channel in 2002 with the title ''Opération Lune''. It parodies conspiracy theories with faked interviews, stories of assassinations of Stanley Kubrick's assistants by the CIA, and a variety of conspicuous mistakes, puns, and references to old movie characters, inserted through the film as clues for the viewer. Nevertheless, ''Opération Lune'' is still taken at face value by some conspiracy believers.

An article entitled "Stanley Kubrick and the Moon Hoax" appeared on Usenet in 1995, in the newsgroup "alt.humor.best-of-usenet". One passage – on how Kubrick was supposedly coerced into the conspiracy – reads:

<blockquote>NASA further leveraged their position by threatening to publicly reveal the heavy involvement of Mr. Kubrick's younger brother, Raul, with the American Communist Party. This would have been an intolerable embarrassment to Mr. Kubrick, especially since the release of ''Dr. Strangelove''.</blockquote>

Kubrick had no such brother – the article was a spoof, complete with a giveaway sentence describing Kubrick shooting the moonwalk "on location" on the Moon. Nevertheless, the claim was taken up in earnest;<ref>cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/bibkubrick.html |title=Clavius: Bibliography – the kubrick article |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013</ref> Clyde Lewis used it almost word-for-word,<ref name="clydelewis" /> whereas Room 237|Jay Weidner gave the brother a more senior status within the party:

<blockquote>No one knows how the powers-that-be convinced Kubrick to direct the Apollo landings. Maybe they had compromised Kubrick in some way. The fact that his brother, Raul Kubrick, was the head of the American Communist Party may have been one of the avenues pursued by the government to get Stanley to cooperate.<ref>cite web |last=Weidner |first=Jay |url=http://jayweidner.com/AlchemicalKubrickIIa.html |title=How Stanley Kubrick Faked the Apollo Moon Landings |work=jayweidner.com |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123205838/http://jayweidner.com/AlchemicalKubrickIIa.html |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all </ref></blockquote>

In July 2009, Weidner posted on his webpage "Secrets of the Shining", where he states that Kubrick's ''The Shining (film)|The Shining'' (1980) is a veiled confession of his role in the scam project.<ref>cite web |url=https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/luna/luna_apollomissions10.htm |title=Secrets of the Shining |last=Weidner |first=Jay |website=Bibliotecapleyades.net |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2017</ref><ref>YouTube|7hRgQ-Qk7u8|Faked Moon Landing Hidden Subliminal Messages in Stanley Kubrick's Movie 'The Shining'.

The 2015 movie ''Moonwalkers (film)|Moonwalkers'' is a fictional account of a CIA agent's claim of Kubrick's involvement.

Aside from NASA, a number of groups and individuals tracked the Apollo missions as they happened. On later missions, NASA released information to the public explaining where and when the spacecraft could be sighted. Their flight paths were tracked using radar and they were sighted and photographed using telescopes. Also, radio transmissions between the astronauts on the surface and in orbit were independently recorded.
