 Vedic mythology

The earliest idea of "egg-shaped cosmos" comes from some of the Sanskrit scriptures. The Sanskrit term for it is Brahmanda (ब्रह्माण्ड) which is derived from two words - 'Brahma' (ब्रह्मा) the creator god in Hinduism and 'anda' (अण्ड) meaning 'egg'. Certain Puranas such as the Brahmanda Purana speak of this in detail.

The Rig Veda (RV 10.121) uses a similar name for the source of the universe: Hiranyagarbha (हिरण्यगर्भ) which literally means "golden fetus" or "golden womb". The Upanishads elaborate that the Hiranyagarbha floated around in emptiness for a while, and then broke into two halves which formed Dyaus (Heaven) and Prithvi (Earth). The Rig Veda has a similar coded description of the division of the universe in its early stages.

 Zoroastrianism mythology 
According on Zoroastrianism cosmological, the period of (material) creation, also to last 3,000 years, began after the treaty, when Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd recited the Ahuna Vairya|Ahunwar (Av. Ahuna Vairiia) prayer, reveal­ing to Angra Mainyu|Ahriman his ultimate defeat and causing him to fall back into the darkness in a stupor, which lasted for the entire period of the creation.  During this time Ohrmazd fashioned his creations in material (''gētīg'') form, by celebrating a “spiritual ''yasna''”.  He placed each creation under the protection of one of the seven Amesha Spenta|Amahraspands (Av. Aməša Spənta).  First he created the sky (protected by Shahrevar|Šahrewar, Av. Xšaθra Vairiia), which enclosed the world like the shell of an egg.  The second creation was water (protected by Haurvatat|Hordād, Av. Haurvatāt), which filled the lower half of the “egg.”  The third creation, earth (protected by Spandārmad, Av. Spenta Armaiti|Spənta Ārmaiti), shaped like a flat disk, floated on the primeval waters.  On it stood the fourth, fifth, and sixth creations, respectively the single plant or tree (protected by Ameretat|Amurdād;  Av. Amərətāt), the uniquely created bull (protected by Bahman|Wahman, Av. Vohu Manah), and the first man, Keyumars|Gayōmard (Av. Gaiiō.marətan, protected by Ohrmazd himself).  The seventh creation, fire (protected by Asha Vahishta|Ardwahišt;  Av. Aṧa Vahišta), was said to have permeated all other creations. During the 3,000 years of the period of material creation these creations were motionless, and the sun stood still in the middle of the sky<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cosmogony-i|title=COSMOGONY AND COSMOLOGY i.

 Greek mythology 
The Orphic Egg in the ancient Greek Orphism (religion)|Orphic tradition is the cosmic egg from which hatched the primordial Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic deity Phanes (mythology)|Phanes/Protogonus (variously equated also with Zeus, Pan (mythology)|Pan, Metis (mythology)|Metis, Eros, Erikepaios and Bromius) who in turn created the other gods.<ref>West, M. L. (1983) ''The Orphic Poems''. Oxford:Oxford University Press. p. 205</ref> The egg is often depicted with a serpent wound around it.

Many threads of earlier myths are apparent in the new tradition. Phanes (mythology)|Phanes was believed to have been hatched from the World-Egg of Chronos (Time) and Ananke (mythology)|Ananke (Necessity) or Nyx (Night). His older wife Nyx (mythology)|Nyx called him Protogenus. As she created nighttime, he created daytime. He also created the method of creation by mingling. He was made the ruler of the deities and passed the sceptre to Nyx. This new Orphic tradition states that Nyx later gave the sceptre to her son Uranus (mythology)|Uranos before it passed to Cronus and then to Zeus, who retained it.

 Egyptian mythology 
The Ancient Egyptians abided by a multiplicity of truths when it came to creation myths. For instance, the Hermopolis (Lower Egypt)|Hermopolitan, Heliopolitans|Heliopolitan, and Memphis, Egypt|Memphite theologies, were equally validated. Under the Hermopolitan theology, there is the Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad, which represents the conditions before the Ancient Egyptian deities|gods were created (Van Dijk, 1995).
An aspect within the Ogdoad is the Cosmic Egg, from which all things are born. Life comes from the Cosmic Egg; the sun god Ra was born from the primordial egg in a stage known as the first occasion (Dunand, 2004).

 Phoenician mythology 
Unreferenced section|date=July 2015
A philosophical creation story traced to "the cosmogony of ''Taautus'', whom Philo of Byblos explicitly identified with the Egyptian Thoth&mdash;"the first who thought of the invention of letters, and began the writing of records"&mdash; which begins with Erebus and Wind, between which ''Eros (god)|Eros'' 'Desire' came to be. From this was produced ''Môt'' which seems to be the Phoenician/Ge'ez/Hebrew/Arabic/Ancient Egyptian word for 'Death' but which the account says may mean 'mud'. In a mixed confusion, the germs of life appear, and intelligent animals called ''Zophasemin'' (explained probably correctly as 'observers of heaven') formed together as an egg, perhaps. The account is not clear. Then Môt burst forth into light and the heavens were created and the various elements found their stations.

Following the etymological line of Jacob Bryant one might also consider with regard to the meaning of ''Môt'', that according to the Ancient Egyptians ''Ma'at'' was the personification of the fundamental order of the universe, without which all of creation would perish. She was also considered the wife of Thoth.

 Chinese mythology 
Unreferenced section|date=July 2015
In the myth of Pangu, developed by Taoist monks hundreds of years after Lao Zi, the universe began as an egg.  A primeval Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic giant named Pangu, born inside the egg, broke it into two halves: the upper half became the sky, while the lower half became the earth.  As the god grew taller, the sky and the earth grew thicker and were separated further.  Finally Pangu died and his body parts became different parts of the earth.

 Norse mythology 
In the book ''Futhark'' by Edred Thorsson, the cosmic egg is compared to the rune Hagalaz which is symbolic of the fertile void from whence everything is spawned. It is symbolic of the chasm Ginnungagap or the void in that the Hermaphrodite| hermaphroditic giant Ymir and the cow Auðumbla dwelt as primeval beings. Hagalaz, as well as representing elemental disruption or chaos, is the potential for the birth of good or evil depending on what sorts of being or entity fertilizes the egg. In magic rituals, users of Seiðr|seidr or galdr will take an egg and "fertilize" it with their desired outcome, whether it be good or evil, and then crack the egg to release what is built up inside.

: ''and shower of sleet
: ''and sickness of serpents.

 Finnish mythology 
In the ''Kalevala'', the Finnish mythology|Finnish national epic, there is a myth of the world being created from the fragments of an egg laid by a diving duck on the knee of Ilmatar, goddess of the air:

: ''One egg's lower half transformed''
: ''And became the earth below,''
: ''And its upper half transmuted''
: ''And became the sky above;''
: ''From the yolk the sun was made,''
: ''Light of day to shine upon us;''
: ''From the white the moon was formed,''
: ''Light of night to gleam above us;''
: ''All the colored brighter bits''
: ''Rose to be the stars of heaven''
: ''And the darker crumbs changed into''
: ''Clouds and cloudlets in the sky.''

In many original folk poems, the duck - or sometimes an eagle - laid its eggs on the knee of Väinämöinen.<ref>Martti Haavio: Väinämöinen: Suomalaisten runojen keskushahmo. Porvoo: WSOY, 1950</ref>

 Polynesian mythology 
In Cook Islands mythology, deep within Avaiki (the Underworld), a place described as resembling a vast hollow coconut shell, there dwelt in the deepest depths, the primordial mother goddess, Varima-te-takere. Her domain was described as being so narrow, that her knees touched her chin. It was from this place that she created the first man, Avatea, a god of light, a hybrid being half man and half fish. He was sent to the Upperworld to shine light in the land of men, and his eyes were believed to be the sun and the moon.<ref>cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|title=Myths and Songs from the South Pacific|url=https://archive.org/stream/mythsandsongsfro013889mbp#page/n27/mode/2up|date=1876|publisher=London: Henry S.

 Dogon mythology 

"''In the beginning, Amma, alone, was in the shape of an egg: the four collar bones were fused, dividing the egg into air, earth, fire, and water, establishing also the four cardinal directions. Within this cosmic egg was the material and the structure of the universe, and the 266 signs that embraced the essence of all things. The first creation of the world by Amma was, however, a failure. The second creation began when Amma planted a seed within herself, a seed that resulted in the shape of man. But in the process of its gestation, there was a flaw, meaning that the universe would now have within it the possibilities for incompleteness. Now the egg became two placentas, each containing a set of twins, male and female. After sixty years, one of the males, Ogo, broke out of the placenta and attempted to create his own universe, in opposition to that being created by Amma. But he was unable to say the words that would bring such a universe into being. He then descended, as Amma transformed into the earth the fragment of placenta that went with Ogo into the void. Ogo interfered with the creative potential of the earth by having incestuous relations with it. His counterpart, Nommo, a participant in the revolt, was then killed by Amma, the parts of his body cast in all directions, bringing a sense of order to the world. When, five days later, Amma brought the pieces of Nommo's body together, restoring him to life, Nommo became ruler of the universe. He created four spirits, the ancestors of the Dogon people; Amma sent Nommo and the spirits to earth in an ark, and so the earth was restored. Along the way, Nommo uttered the words of Amma, and the sacred words that create were made available to humans. In the meantime, Ogo was transformed by Amma into Yuguru, the Pale Fox, who would always be alone, always be incomplete, eternally in revolt, ever wandering the earth seeking his female soul.

 Modern mythology 
In 1955 poet and writer Robert Graves published the mythography ''The Greek Myths'', a compendium of Greek mythology normally published in two volumes. Within this work Graves' imaginatively reconstructed "Pelasgian creation myth" features a supreme creator deity|creatrix, Eurynome, "The Goddess of All Things",<ref name="Graves1955"/> who arose naked from Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos to part sea from sky so that she could dance upon the waves. Catching the Anemoi#Boreas|north wind at her back and, rubbing it between her hands, she warms the ''pneuma'' and spontaneous generation|spontaneously generates the serpent Ophion, who mates with her. In the form of a dove upon the waves, she lays the Cosmic Egg and bids Ophion to incubate it by coiling seven times around until it splits in two and hatches "all things that exist... sun, moon, planets, stars, the earth with its mountains and rivers, its trees, herbs, and living creatures".<ref name="Graves1955">cite book |last=Graves |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Graves |year=1990 |origyear=1955 |title=The Greek Myths |volume=1 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-001026-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKSxQQAACAAJ</ref>

 In modern cosmology 
The concept was resurrected by modern science in the 1930s and explored by theoreticians during the following two decades.  The idea comes from a perceived need to reconcile Edwin Hubble's observation of an expanding universe (which was also predicted from Albert Einstein|Einstein's equations of general relativity by Alexander Friedmann) with the notion that the universe must be eternally old. Current Physical cosmology|cosmological models maintain that 13.8 billion years ago, the entire mass of the universe was compressed into a gravitational singularity, the so-called cosmic egg, from which it expanded to its current state (following the Big Bang).

Georges Lemaître proposed in 1927 that the cosmos originated from what he called the ''primeval atom''.

In the late 1940s, George Gamow's assistant Cosmology|cosmological researcher Ralph Alpher, proposed the name ylem for the primordial substance that existed between the big crunch of the previous universe and the big bang of our own universe.<ref>''The Cosmos''--''Voyage Through the Universe'' series, New York:1988 Time-Life Books Page 75</ref> ''Ylem'' is closely related to the concept of supersymmetry.  <ref>Edward Harrison: Masks of the Universe: Changing Ideas on the Nature of the Cosmos, Cambridge University Press, 08.05.2003, p. 224 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=tSowGCP0kMIC&pg=PA224&lpg=PA224&dq=ylem+supersymmetrie&source=bl&ots=p36VfOjibz&sig=LVrnIUJVcagTU5MYYDVf7b7B5-U&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAr7yZtJfdAhVGPBoKHfyODR4Q6AEwBnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=ylem%20supersymmetrie&f=false online]) </ref>
