A space station, also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station, is a spacecraft|Space craft  capable of supporting crewmembers, which is designed to remain in Outer space|space (most commonly as an artificial satellite in low Earth orbit) for an extended period of time and for other spacecraft to dock. A space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for human spaceflight by lack of major spacecraft propulsion|propulsion or landing systems. Instead, other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station. As of|2018, one fully functioning space station is in Earth orbit: the International Space Station (operational and permanently inhabited). Various other components of future space stations, such as Japan's space elevator and U.S. inflatable modules, are also being tested in orbit. Previous stations include the Almaz and Salyut Program|Salyut series, Skylab, ''Mir'', and Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2 . China, Russia, the U.S., as well as a few private companies are all planning other stations for the coming decades.

Today's space stations are research platforms, used to study the effects of long-term space flight on the human body as well as to provide platforms for greater number and length of scientific studies than available on other space vehicles. Each crew member stays aboard the station for weeks or months, but rarely more than a year. Since the ill-fated flight of Soyuz 11 to Salyut 1, all human spaceflight duration records have been set aboard space stations. The List of spaceflight records#10 longest human space flights|duration record for a single spaceflight is 437.7 days, set by Valeriy Polyakov aboard ''Mir'' from 1994 to 1995. As of|2016, four cosmonauts have completed single missions of over a year, all aboard ''Mir''. Space stations have also been used for both military and civilian purposes. The last military-use space station was Salyut 5, which was used by the Almaz program of the Soviet Union in 1976 and 1977.<ref>S:NASA FACTS/Russian Space Stations|Russian Space Stations (wikisource)</ref>

File:Noordung space station.jpg|thumb|Rotating space station envisioned by Herman Potočnik in ''The Problem of Space Travel'' (1929)
Space stations have been envisaged since at least as early as 1869 when Edward Everett Hale wrote "The Brick Moon".<ref name="Wired">

During the Second World War, German scientists researched the theoretical concept of an orbital weapon based on a space station. Pursuing Oberth's idea of a space-based weapon, the so-called "sun gun" was a concept of a space station orbiting Earth at a height of convert|8200|km, with a weapon that was to utilize the sun's energy.<ref name="Time">cite journal  | date = July 9, 1945  | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852344-1,00.html  | title = Science: Sun Gun  | journal = Time  </ref>

In 1951, in ''Collier's Weekly'', Wernher von Braun published his design for a rotating wheel space station, which referenced Potočnik's idea – however these concepts would never leave the concept stage during the 20th century.<ref name=boys/>

During the same time as von Braun pursued Potočnik's ideas, the Soviet design bureaus – chiefly Vladimir Chelomey's OKB-52 – were pursuing Tsiolkovsky's ideas for space stations. The work by OKB-52 would lead to the Almaz programme and (together with OKB-1) to the first space station: Salyut 1. The developed hardware laid the ground for the Salyut programme|Salyut and Mir space stations, and is even today a considerable part of the International Space Station|ISS space station.<ref name="Salyut">Cite book|title=Salyut – The First Space Station: Triumph and Tragedy|first=Grujica S.|last=Ivanovich|year=2008|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-73973-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbDGMiXvdG0C|accessdate=1 February 2018</ref>

main|Salyut program|Almaz|Skylab
File:Skylab 3 flyaround.jpg|thumb|The U.S. Skylab station of the 1970s
The first space station was Salyut 1, which was launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1971. Like all the early space stations, it was "monolithic", intended to be constructed and launched in one piece, and then inhabited by a crew later. As such, monolithic stations generally contained all their supplies and experimental equipment when launched, and were considered "expended", and then abandoned, when these were used up.<ref name="Salyut"/>

The earlier Soviet stations were all designated "Salyut", but among these there were two distinct types: civilian and military. The military stations, Salyut 2, Salyut 3, and Salyut 5, were also known as Almaz stations.<ref name="Outposts">Cite book|title=Outposts on the Frontier: A Fifty-Year History of Space Stations|first=Jay|last=Chladek|year=2017|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-2292-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V60oDwAAQBAJ|accessdate=1 February 2018</ref>

The civilian stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 were built with two docking ports, which allowed a second crew to visit, bringing a new spacecraft with them; the Soyuz 7K-T|Soyuz ferry could spend 90 days in space, after which point it needed to be replaced by a fresh Soyuz spacecraft.<ref name=MHH>cite web|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf|title=Mir Hardware Heritage|author=D.S.F. Portree|publisher=NASA|year=1995|accessdate=30 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5il9QixAg?url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf|archivedate=3 August 2009|df=</ref> This allowed for a crew to man the station continually. Skylab was also equipped with two docking ports, like second-generation stations, but the extra port was never utilized. The presence of a second port on the new stations allowed Progress spacecraft|Progress supply vehicles to be docked to the station, meaning that fresh supplies could be brought to aid long-duration missions. This concept was expanded on Salyut 7, which "hard docked" with a TKS spacecraft|TKS tug shortly before it was abandoned; this served as a proof-of-concept for the use of modular space stations. The later Salyuts may reasonably be seen as a transition between the two groups.<ref name="Outposts"/>

main|Mir
File:Mir during STS-74 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Earth and the ''Mir'' station

Unlike previous stations, the Soviet space station ''Mir'' had a Modular design|modular design; a core unit was launched, and additional modules, generally with a specific role, were later added to that.  This method allows for greater flexibility in operation, as well as removing the need for a single immensely powerful launch vehicle. Modular stations are also designed from the outset to have their supplies provided by logistical support, which allows for a longer lifetime at the cost of requiring regular support launches.<ref>cite book|title=The History of Mir 1986–2000|year=2000|publisher=British Interplanetary Society|isbn=978-0-9506597-4-9|editor=Hall, R.</ref>

Future modules are still based on initial design and capabilities.

The first module of the International Space Station, Zarya, was launched in 1998.<ref name="CASIS">Cite web|title=History and Timeline of the ISS|website=Center for the Advancement of Science in Space|url=https://www.iss-casis.org/about/iss-timeline/|accessdate=8 February 2018</ref> The ISS is divided into two main sections, the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) and the US Orbital Segment (USOS).

USOS modules were brought to the station by the Space Shuttle and manually attached to the ISS by crews during Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs. Connections are made manually for electrical power, data, propulsion and cooling fluids. This results in a single piece which is not designed for disassembly.<ref>cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/9794/chapter/8|isbn=978-0-309-06938-0|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2000|pages=28–30|author=Thomas Kelly|title=Engineering Challenges to the Long-Term Operation of the International Space Station|display-authors=etal</ref>

The Russian Orbital Segment's modules are able to launch, fly and dock themselves without human intervention using Proton (rocket)|Proton rockets.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/mae/aerospace/publications/JDSC_RoadToAutonomy.pdf |title=Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering |publisher=Usu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13</ref> Connections are automatically made for power, data and propulsion fluids and gases. The Russian approach would hypothetically allow the assembly of space stations orbiting other worlds in preparation for human missions.

Russian modular or "second-generation" space stations differ from "monolithic" single-piece stations by allowing reconfiguration of the station to suit changing needs. According to a 2009 report, RKK Energia considered removing some modules of the ROS when the end of mission is reached for the ISS to reuse them as parts of a new station, known as the Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex.<ref>cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8064060.stm|title=Russia 'to save its ISS modules'|publisher=BBC News|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009 | first=Anatoly | last=Zak</ref> However, in September 2017 the head of Roscosmos said that the technical feasibility of separating the station to form OPSEK had been studied, and there were now no plans to separate the Russian segment from the ISS.<ref>cite web |last=Foust |first=Jeff |url=http://spacenews.com/international-partners-in-no-rush-regarding-future-of-iss/ |title=International partners in no rush regarding future of ISS |website=SpaceNews |date=25 September 2017 |accessdate=26 October 2017</ref>

main|Effect of spaceflight on the human body
The space station environment presents a variety of challenges to human habitability, including short-term problems such as the limited supplies of air, water and food and the need to manage waste heat, and long-term ones such as weightlessness and relatively high levels of ionizing radiation. These conditions can create long-term health problems for space-station inhabitants, including muscle atrophy, Spaceflight osteopenia|bone deterioration, Space adaptation syndrome|balance disorders, Visual impairment due to intracranial pressure|eyesight disorders, and elevated risk of cancer.<ref name="NYT-20140127">cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Beings Not Made for Space |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/science/bodies-not-made-for-space.html |date=27 January 2014 |work=New York Times |accessdate=27 January 2014 </ref>

Future space habitats may attempt to address these issues, and could be designed for occupation beyond the weeks or months that current missions typically last. Possible solutions include the creation of artificial gravity by a Rotating wheel space station|rotating structure, the inclusion of radiation shielding, and the development of on-site agricultural ecosystems. Some designs might even accommodate large numbers of people, becoming essentially "cities in space" where people would reside semi-permanently. For now, no space station suitable for long-term human residence has ever been built, since the current launch costs for even a small station are not economically or politically viable.<ref>Cite web|title=Space Settlements: A Design Study|year=1975|publisher=NASA|url=https://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/s.s.doc.html|accessdate=10 February 2018</ref>

 Architecture 
A space station is a complex system with many interrelated subsystems, including structure, electrical power, thermal control, Attitude dynamics and control|attitude determination and control<!-- attitude (=orientation), not altitude (=height)-->, orbital navigation and propulsion, automation and robotics, computing and communications, environmental and life support, crew facilities, and crew and cargo transportation.

 Environmental microbiology 

Despite an expanding array of molecular approaches for detecting microorganisms, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of the microbial cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. Molds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass and rubber.<ref>cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/11may_locad3/|author=Trudy E.

* The United States Air Force ''Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL)'' project was to employ elements of existing Project Gemini|Gemini craft. This was unusual in being an explicitly military project, as opposed to the Soviet Almaz program, which was heavily intertwined with, and concealed by, the contemporaneous Salyut program. It was canceled in 1969, about a year before the first planned test flight.
* A second Skylab unit (''Skylab B'') was manufactured, as a backup article; due to the high costs of providing launch vehicles, and a desire by NASA to cease Saturn and Apollo operations in time to prepare for the Space Shuttle coming into service, it was never flown. The hull can now be seen in the National Air and Space Museum, in Washington DC.
* A number of additional ''Salyut Program|Salyuts'' were produced, as backups or as flight articles that were later canceled.
* The U.S. ''Space Station Freedom'' program, despite being under development for ten years, was never launched, instead evolving into the International Space Station.
* The Soviet/Russian ''Mir-2'' station, which was never constructed, had some of its elements incorporated into the International Space Station.
