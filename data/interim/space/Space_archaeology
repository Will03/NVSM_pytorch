In archaeology, space archaeology is the research-based study of various human-made items found in space, their interpretation as clues to the adventures mankind has experienced in space, and their preservation as cultural heritage.<ref name=Archaeology>cite journal|last=Capelotti|first=P.J.|title=Space: The Final [Archaeological] Frontier|journal=Archaeology|date=November–December 2004|volume=57| issue = 6|url=http://www.archaeology.org/0411/etc/space.html|accessdate=3 June 2012|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America</ref>

It includes launch complexes on Earth, orbital debris, satellites, and objects and structures on other celestial bodies such as Mars. It also includes the applied field of cultural resource which evaluates the significance of space sites and objects in terms of national and international preservation laws. Cultural resource looks at what, how and why these artifacts of our recent history should be preserved for future generations.

Satellites
Satellites are key artifacts in examining human encounters with space over time and the effect we leave through artificial objects. This list includes:
* Vanguard 1 - Launched in 1958, the manmade satellite Vanguard 1 and the upper stage of its launch rocket are the oldest still in orbit. Vanguard 1 lost communication in 1964 but had a few different functions, including the obtention of geodetic measurements and the testing of capabilities.<ref>[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1958-002B] NASA. NASA, n.d. Web. 26 Feb. 2015.</ref>
* Asterix-1 - With the intention of testing the French Diamant Rocket, Asterix-1 was the first French satellite launched into space. Asterix-1 had a very short lived transmission period of 2 days but remains in orbit and is expected to for centuries.<ref>[http://spacearchaeology.org/] Space Archaeology." Space Archaeology. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Feb. 2015.</ref>
* Skynet 1A - Providing communication to Middle Eastern forces, Skynet 1A was launched over the Indian Ocean in 1969. No longer in operation, Skynet 1A has an approximate lifetime of more than 1 million years.<ref name="Space Archaeology 2015">Space Archaeology." Space Archaeology. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Feb. 2015.</ref>
* Kosmos 2222 - With the intended function of identifying ballistic missiles launches, Cosmos-2222 was launched in 1992. With an operation life of 4 years, Cosmos and its rocket body remain in orbit today.<ref name="Space Archaeology 2015"/>

Satellites are just one example of several human traces we leave behind in, and out of this world.

Legal matters
Main|Space law
See also|Common heritage of mankind
The complexities and ambiguities of international legal structures to deal with these sites as cultural resources leave them vulnerable to impacts in the near future by many varieties of space travel. An outline of the legal situation was made by Harrison Schmitt and Neil Armstrong, both of them astronauts who walked on the moon as part of the Apollo program.<ref name=Armstrong>cite book |title=Return to the Moon |author1=Harrison H. Schmitt |author2=Neil Armstrong |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g06vVWEW2mgC&pg=PA280 |pages=280''ff'' |isbn=0-387-24285-6 |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2006</ref> The governing law on the Moon and other celestial bodies is the ''Outer Space Treaty'' of 1967 based upon guidelines from experience in the Antarctic. Another source of ideas is the ''Law of the Sea''. The ''Outer Space Treaty'' contains language stating that space objects remain under the jurisdiction of the originating state, and the civil and criminal laws of that state govern private parties both on the Moon and ''events leading up to such activity''. State parties are to inform the public about the nature and result of their activities.

The later ''Moon Agreement'' of 1979 was signed but not ratified by many spacefaring nations. Schmitt and Armstrong believe this lack of ratification relates to disagreement over wording such as "the Moon and its natural resources are the common heritage of mankind", which is taken as possibly excluding private activity, and objections to wording concerning the disruption of the existing environment.citation needed|date=May 2015
<!-- For an extensive discussion see Schmitt and Armstrong.<ref name=Armstrong/> For the treaty text see [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/peace/docs/treatyouterspace.html UN treaty on outer space of 1967]. -->

A non-profit organization called For All Moonkind, Inc. is working to establish legal protections for archaeological sites in outer space.  The entirely volunteer group includes space lawyers and policymakers from around the world.  As a result of their efforts, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space agreed, in January 2018, to consider the creation of a "universal space heritage sites program.".<ref>cite web|last1=UNCOPUOS|title=Draft Declaration|url=http://www.unoosa.org/res/oosadoc/data/documents/2018/aac_105c_12018crp/aac_105c_12018crp_6_0_html/AC105_C1_2018_CRP06E.pdf|website=unoosa.org|publisher=UNOOSA|accessdate=7 February 2018</ref>  Having created a discussion around preservation in outer space, For All Moonkind is now focused on preparing drafts of implementing regulations and protocols.

Background and history
During a graduate seminar at New Mexico State University in 1999, Ralph Gibson asked: "Does federal preservation law apply on the moon?" That question led to Gibson's thesis "''Lunar Archaeology: The Application of Federal Historic Preservation Law to the Site where Humans first set foot upon the Moon''", to a grant from the New Mexico Space Grant Consortium, and to creation of the Lunar Legacy Project.<ref>http://spacegrant.nmsu.edu/lunarlegacies/</ref>

A manuscript by scientists at NASA and ESA in 2004 raised the possibility of preserving Apollo landing sites for future "astroarcheologists."<ref name="Glavin et al. 2004">cite web|title=Glavin et al. (2004) Int. J. Astrobio. 3, 265-271.|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/S1473550404001958#.</ref>

In 2006, Dr. O’Leary with New Mexico State Historic Preservation Officer Katherine Slick and the New Mexico Museum of Space History (NMMSH), documented the Apollo 11 Tranquility Base archaeological site on the Moon.<ref name=Newsletter>[http://lib.nmsu.edu/aboutlib/newsletter/sept02.pdf New Mexico State University Newsletter].</ref> Some legal aspects of this work already have surfaced.<ref name=Oleary>[http://spacegrant.nmsu.edu/lunarlegacies/lunar_archaeology.pdf Applicability of federal historic preservation law]</ref>

Though its mission isn't primarily archaeological, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has imaged all of the Apollo landing sites as well as rediscovering the location of the first Lunokhod 1 rover, lost since 1971 (note: all of the U. S. flags left on the moon during the Apollo missions were found to still be standing, with the exception of the one left during the Apollo 11 mission, which was blown over during that mission's lift-off from the lunar surface and return to the mission command module in lunar orbit; the degree to which these flags are preserved and intact remains unknown).<ref>cite web |url=http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/620-Question-Answered!.html |title=Question Answered! |last=Robinson |first=Mark |date=27 July 2012 |work=LROC News System |publisher=Arizona State University |accessdate=28 October 2012</ref>

Based on an idea by British amateur astronomer Nick Howes, a team of experts has been assembled to try to locate the Lunar Module of the Apollo 10 mission nicknamed "Snoopy", which was released during the mission and is currently thought to be in a heliocentric orbit.<ref name=redorbit.com>cite web|title=Astronomy Team Looking For Lost ‘Snoopy’ Module From Apollo 10|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1112391824/astronomy-team-looking-for-lost-snoopy-module-from-apollo-10/|accessdate=3 June 2012</ref> The Snoopy mission is encouraged by the 2002 re-sighting of the Apollo 12 third-stage rocket.<ref name=redorbit.com/>
