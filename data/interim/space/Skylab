United States space program sidebar

Skylab was a United States space station launched and operated by NASA, and occupied for about 24 weeks between May 1973 and February 1974&nbsp;– the only space station the U.S. has operated exclusively.  In 1979 it fell back to Earth amid huge worldwide media attention.  Skylab included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems necessary for crew survival and scientific experiments. It was launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of convert|170000|lb|kg|sigfig=2. Lifting Skylab into low earth orbit was the final mission and launch of a Saturn V rocket (famous for carrying the Moon landing#Manned Moon landings|manned Moon landing missions).<ref name="1973 Evaluation">cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19730025115.pdf |format=PDF |title=SATURN V LAUNCH VEHICLE FLIGHT EVALUATION REPORT SA-513 SKYLAB 1 |work=NASA |date=1973 |accessdate=2016-05-29 </ref>  Three missions delivered three-astronaut crews in the Apollo command and service module (Apollo CSM), launched by the smaller Saturn IB rocket. For the final two manned missions to Skylab, a backup Apollo CSM/Saturn IB was assembled and made ready in case an in-orbit rescue mission was needed, but this backup vehicle was never flown.

The station was damaged during launch when the micrometeoroid shield tore away from the workshop, taking one of the main solar panel arrays with it and jamming the other main array. This deprived Skylab of most of its electrical power, and also removed protection from intense solar heating, threatening to make it unusable. The first crew was able to save Skylab by deploying a replacement heat shade and freeing the jammed solar panels. This was the first time a repair of this magnitude had been performed in space.

Skylab included the Apollo Telescope Mount (a multi-spectral solar observatory), Multiple Docking Adapter (with two docking ports), Airlock Module with extravehicular activity (EVA) hatches, and the Orbital Workshop (the main habitable space inside Skylab). Electrical power came from solar arrays, as well as fuel cells in the docked Apollo CSM. The rear of the station included a large waste tank, propellant tanks for maneuvering jets, and a heat radiator. Numerous experiments were conducted aboard Skylab during its operational life. Solar science was significantly advanced by the telescope, and observation of the Sun was unprecedented. Thousands of photographs of Earth were taken, and the Earth Resources Experiment Package (EREP) viewed Earth with sensors that recorded data in the visible, infrared, and microwave spectral regions. The record for human time spent in orbit was extended beyond the 23 days set by the Soyuz 11 crew aboard Salyut 1, to 84 days by the Skylab 4 crew.

Later plans to reuse Skylab were stymied by delays in development of the Space Shuttle, and Skylab's decaying orbit could not be stopped.  Skylab's atmospheric entry|atmospheric reentry began on July 11, 1979.<ref name=benson371/>  Before re-entry, NASA flight controller|ground controllers tried to adjust Skylab's orbit to minimize the risk of debris landing in populated areas,<ref name="time19790716"/> with their target—the south Indian Ocean—partially successful. Debris showered Western Australia; recovered pieces indicated that the station had disintegrated lower than expected.<ref name= lewis1984/>  As the Skylab program drew to a close, NASA's focus had shifted to the development of the Space Shuttle.  After Skylab, NASA space station/laboratory projects included Spacelab, Shuttle-Mir|Shuttle-''Mir'', and Space Station Freedom|Space Station ''Freedom'' (which was later merged into the International Space Station).

Background
Rocket engineer Wernher von Braun, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, and other early advocates of manned space travel, expected until the 1960s that a space station would be an important early step in space exploration. Von Braun participated in the publishing of a series of influential articles in ''Collier's'' magazine from 1952 to 1954, titled "Man Will Conquer Space Soon!". He envisioned a large, circular station 250 feet (75m) in diameter that would rotate to generate artificial gravity and require a fleet of 7,000-ton (6,500-metric ton) Space Shuttle design process|space shuttles for construction in orbit. The 80 men aboard the station would include astronomers operating a telescope, meteorologists to forecast the weather, and soldiers to conduct surveillance. Von Braun expected that future expeditions to the Moon and Mars would leave from the station.<ref>harvp|Heppenheimer|1999|pp=2–5|ps=.</ref>

The development of the transistor, the solar cell, and telemetry, led in the 1950s and early 1960s to unmanned satellites that could take photographs of weather patterns or enemy nuclear weapons and send them to Earth. A large station was no longer necessary for such purposes, and the United States Apollo program to send men to the Moon chose a mission mode that would not need in-orbit assembly. A smaller station that a single rocket could launch, retained value however for scientific purposes.<ref>harvp|Heppenheimer|1999|pp=55–60|ps=.</ref>

=Early studies=
In 1959, von Braun, head of the Development Operations Division at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, submitted his final Project Horizon plans to the U.S. Army. The overall goal of Horizon was to place men on the Moon, a mission that would soon be taken over by the rapidly forming NASA. Although concentrating on the Moon missions, von Braun also detailed an orbiting laboratory built out of a Horizon upper stage,<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=23|ps=.</ref> an idea used for Skylab.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=9|ps=.</ref> A number of NASA centers studied various space station designs in the early 1960s. Studies generally looked at platforms launched by the Saturn V, followed up by crews launched on Saturn IB using an Apollo command and service module,<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=10|ps=.</ref> or a Project Gemini|Gemini capsule<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=14|ps=.</ref> on a Titan II GLV|Titan II-C, the latter being much less expensive in the case where cargo was not needed. Proposals ranged from an Apollo-based station with two to three men, or a small "canister" for four men with Gemini capsules resupplying it, to a large, rotating station with 24 men and an operating lifetime of about five years.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|pp=13–14|ps=.</ref> A proposal to study the use of a Saturn S-IVB as a manned space laboratory was documented in 1962 by the Douglas Aircraft Company.<ref>cite book |title= MSFC Skylab Orbital Workshop |volume= vol. 1 |date= May 1974 |page= 21-1</ref>

Main|Apollo Applications Program

NASA management was concerned about losing the 400,000 workers involved in Apollo after landing on the Moon in 1969.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|pp=20, 22|ps=.</ref> A reason von Braun, head of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center during the 1960s, advocated for a smaller station after his large one was not built was that he wished to provide his employees with work beyond developing the Saturn rockets, which would be completed relatively early during Project Apollo.<ref>harvp|Heppenheimer|1999|p=61|ps=.</ref> NASA set up the ''Apollo Logistic Support System Office'', originally intended to study various ways to modify the Apollo hardware for scientific missions. The office initially proposed a number of projects for direct scientific study, including an extended-stay lunar mission which required two Saturn V launchers, a "lunar truck" based on the Lunar Module (LEM), a large manned solar telescope using a LEM as its crew quarters, and small space stations using a variety of LEM or CSM-based hardware. Although it did not look at the space station specifically, over the next two years the office would become increasingly dedicated to this role. In August 1965, the office was renamed, becoming the ''Apollo Applications Program'' (AAP).<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=20|ps=.</ref>

As part of their general work, in August 1964 the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) presented studies on an expendable lab known as ''Apollo "X"'', short for ''Apollo Extension System''. "Apollo X" would have replaced the LEM carried on the top of the S-IVB stage with a small space station slightly larger than the CSM's service area, containing supplies and experiments for missions between 15 and 45 days' duration. Using this study as a baseline, a number of different mission profiles were looked at over the next six months.

Main|Wet workshop
File:Dr. von Braun's Sketch of the Space Station 8883912 original.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Von Braun's sketch of a Space Station based on conversion of a Saturn V stage, 1964.

In November 1964, von Braun proposed a more ambitious plan to build a much larger station built from the S-II second stage of a Saturn V. His design replaced the S-IVB third stage with an aeroshell, primarily as an adapter for the CSM on top. Inside the shell was a convert|10|ft|m|adj=on cylindrical equipment section. On reaching orbit, the S-II second stage would be vented to remove any remaining hydrogen fuel, then the equipment section would be slid into it via a large inspection hatch. This became known as a "wet workshop" concept, because of the conversion of an active fuel tank. The station filled the entire interior of the S-II stage's hydrogen tank, with the equipment section forming a "spine" and living quarters located between it and the walls of the booster. This would have resulted in a very large convert|33|by|45|ft|m|1|adj=on living area. Power was to be provided by solar cells lining the outside of the S-II stage.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=22|ps=.</ref>

One problem with this proposal was that it required a dedicated Saturn V launch to fly the station. At the time the design was being proposed, it was not known how many of the then-contracted Saturn Vs would be required to achieve a successful Moon landing. However, several planned Earth-orbit test missions for the LEM and CSM had been canceled, leaving a number of Saturn IBs free for use. Further work led to the idea of building a smaller "wet workshop" based on the S-IVB, launched as the second stage of a Saturn IB.

A number of S-IVB-based stations were studied at MSC from mid-1965, which had much in common with the Skylab design that eventually flew. An airlock would be attached to the hydrogen tank, in the area designed to hold the Apollo Lunar Module|LEM, and a minimum amount of equipment would be installed in the tank itself in order to avoid taking up too much fuel volume. Floors of the station would be made from an open metal framework that allowed the fuel to flow through it. After launch, a follow-up mission launched by a Saturn IB would launch additional equipment, including solar panels, an equipment section and docking adapter, and various experiments. Douglas Aircraft, builder of the S-IVB stage, was asked to prepare proposals along these lines. The company had for several years been proposing stations based on the S-IV stage, before it was replaced by the S-IVB.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=25|ps=.</ref>

File:Wet Workshop.svg|left|thumb|An early "wet workshop" version of Skylab
On April 1, 1966, MSC sent out contracts to Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas, Grumman, and McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell for the conversion of a S-IVB spent stage, under the name ''Saturn S-IVB spent-stage experiment support module'' (SSESM).<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=30|ps=.</ref> In May, astronauts voiced concerns over the purging of the stage's hydrogen tank in space. Nevertheless, in late July it was announced that the Orbital Workshop would be launched as a part of Apollo mission AS-209, originally one of the Earth-orbit CSM test launches, followed by two Saturn I/CSM crew launches, AAP-1 and AAP-2.

MOL remained AAP's chief competitor for funds, although the two programs cooperated on technology. NASA considered flying experiments on MOL, or using its Titan IIIC booster instead of the much more expensive Saturn IB. The agency decided that the Air Force station was not large enough, and that converting Apollo hardware for use with Titan would be too slow and too expensive.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|pp=45–48|ps=.</ref>  The DoD later canceled MOL in June 1969.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=109|ps=.</ref>

File:SKYLAB I - view from a distance.jpg|thumb|left|Launch of the modified Saturn V rocket carrying the Skylab space station

On August 8, 1969, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation received a contract for the conversion of two existing S-IVB stages to the Orbital Workshop configuration. One of the S-IV test stages was shipped to McDonnell Douglas for the construction of a mock-up in January 1970. The Orbital Workshop was renamed "Skylab" in February 1970 as a result of a NASA contest.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=115|ps=.</ref> The actual stage that flew was the upper stage of the AS-212 rocket (the S-IVB stage, S-IVB 212). The mission computer used aboard Skylab was the IBM System 4 Pi|System/4Pi TC-1, a relative of the AP-101 Space Shuttle computers.  A Saturn V originally produced for the Apollo program—before the cancellation of Apollo 18, 19, and 20—was repurposed and redesigned to launch Skylab.<ref>cite web|last=Tate|first=Kara|title=Skylab: How NASA's First Space Station Worked |type= Infographic |url=http://www.space.com/21055-skylab-space-station-nasa-infographic.html|access-date=April 24, 2014</ref> The Saturn V's upper stage was removed, but with the controlling Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit remaining in its standard position.

Skylab was launched on May 14, 1973 by the modified Saturn V.  The launch is sometimes referred to as Skylab 1, or SL-1. Severe damage was sustained during launch and deployment, including the loss of the station's meteor|micrometeoroid shield/sun shade and one of its main solar panels. Debris from the lost micrometeoroid shield further complicated matters by pinning the remaining solar panel to the side of the station, preventing its deployment and thus leaving the station with a huge power deficit.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|pp=253–255|ps=.</ref>

Immediately following Skylab's launch, Pad A at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 was deactivated, and construction proceeded to modify it for the Space Shuttle program, originally targeting Cancelled Space Shuttle missions#STS-1A|a maiden launch in March 1979. The manned missions to Skylab would occur using a Saturn IB rocket from Launch Pad 39B.

SL-1 was the last unmanned launch from LC-39A until February 19, 2017, when SpaceX CRS-10 was launched from there.

Three manned missions, #Mission designations|designated Skylab 2|SL-2, Skylab 3|SL-3 and Skylab 4|SL-4, were made to Skylab.  The first manned mission, SL-2, launched on May 25, 1973 atop a Saturn IB and involved extensive repairs to the station. The crew deployed a parasol-like sunshade through a small instrument port from the inside of the station, bringing station temperatures down to acceptable levels and preventing overheating that would have melted the plastic insulation inside the station and released poisonous gases. This solution was designed by NASA's "Mr. Fix It" Jack Kinzler, who won the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his efforts. The crew conducted further repairs via two spacewalks (extra-vehicular activity, or EVA).  The crew stayed in orbit with Skylab for 28 days. Two additional missions followed, with the launch dates of July 28, 1973 (SL-3) and November 16, 1973 (SL-4), and mission durations of 59 and 84 days, respectively. The last Skylab crew returned to Earth on February 8, 1974.

In addition to the three manned missions, there was a rescue mission on standby that had a crew of two, but could take five back down.

Skylab orbited Earth 2,476 times during the 171 days and 13 hours of its occupation during the three manned Skylab expeditions.  Each of these extended the human record of 23 days for amount of time spent in space set by the Soviet Soyuz 11 crew aboard the space station Salyut 1 on June 30, 1971. Skylab 2 lasted 28 days, Skylab 3 56 days, and Skylab 4 84 days. Astronauts performed ten spacewalks, totaling 42 hours and 16 minutes. Skylab logged about 2,000 hours of scientific and medical experiments, 127,000 frames of film of the Sun and 46,000 of Earth.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=340|ps=.</ref> Solar experiments included photographs of eight solar flares, and produced valuable results<ref>harvp|Belew|1977|p=155|ps=.</ref> that scientists stated would have been impossible to obtain with unmanned spacecraft.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|pp=342–344|ps=.</ref> The existence of the Sun's coronal holes were confirmed because of these efforts.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=357|ps=.</ref> Many of the experiments conducted investigated the astronauts' adaptation to extended periods of microgravity.

Astronauts also found that bending over in weightlessness to put on socks or tie shoelaces strained their stomach muscles.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|pp=306–308|ps=.</ref>

Breakfast began at 7 a.m. Astronauts usually stood to eat, as sitting in microgravity also strained their stomach muscles. They reported that their food—although greatly improved from Apollo—was bland and repetitive, and weightlessness caused utensils, food containers, and bits of food to float away; also, gas in their drinking water contributed to flatulence. After breakfast and preparation for lunch, experiments, tests and repairs of spacecraft systems and, if possible, 90 minutes of physical exercise followed; the station had a bicycle and other equipment, and astronauts could jog around the water tank. After dinner, which was scheduled for 6 p.m., crews performed household chores and prepared for the next day's experiments. Following lengthy daily instructions (some of which were up to 15 meters long) sent via teleprinter, the crews were often busy enough to postpone sleep.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|pp=309, 334|ps=.</ref><ref>harvp|Marietta|Bendix|1978|p=2-7|ps=.</ref>

Experiments

Prior to departure about 80 experiments were named, although they are also described as "almost 300 separate investigations".<ref name="ep-107"/>   Experiments were divided into six broad categories:
* Life science—human physiology, biomedical research; circadian rhythms (mice, gnats)
* Solar physics and astronomy—sun observations (eight telescopes and separate instrumentation); Comet Kohoutek (Skylab 4); stellar observations; space physics
* Earth resources—mineral resources; geology; hurricanes; land and vegetation patterns
* Material science—welding, brazing, metal melting; crystal growth; water / fluid dynamics
* Student research—19 different student proposals.  Several experiments were commended by the crew, including a dexterity experiment and a test of web spinning by spiders in low gravity.
* Other—human adaptability, ability to work, dexterity; habitat design / operations

Because the solar scientific airlock—one of two research airlocks—was unexpectedly occupied by the "Parasol" that replaced the missing meteorite shield, a few experiments were instead installed outside with the telescopes during space walks, or shifted to the Earth-facing scientific airlock.

Skylab 2 spent less time than planned on most experiments due to station repairs. On the other hand, Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 far exceeded the initial experiment plans, once the crews adjusted to the environment and established comfortable working relationships with ground control.

Gyroscopes
File:P46bskylabgyros.jpg|thumb|Skylab could change its attitude without using propellant by changing the spin of large gyroscopes

There were two types of gyroscopes on Skylab. Control-moment gyroscopes could physically move the station, and rate gyroscopes measured the rate of rotation to find its orientation. (see Control moment gyroscope (CMG))<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/23/archives/skylabs-gyroscope-has-worst-seizure-breakdown-feared-working-pair.html|title=Skylab's Gyroscope Has Worst Seizure; Breakdown Feared|last=Times|first=Special To The New York|date=1974-01-23|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-11</ref> The CMG helped provide the fine pointing needed by the Apollo Telescope Mount, and to resist various forces that can change the station's orientation.<ref name="nasa.gov3">[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710007043.pdf]</ref>

Some of the forces acting on Skylab that the pointing system needed to resist:<ref name="nasa.gov3"/>
*Gravity-gradient stabilization|gravity gradient
*aerodynamic disturbance
*internal movements of crew

There was a variety of hand-held and fixed experiments that used various types of film. In addition to the instruments in the ATM solar observatory, 35 and 70&nbsp;mm film cameras were carried on board. A TV camera was carried that recorded video electronically. These electronic signals could be recorded to magnetic tape or be transmitted to Earth by radio signal. The TV camera was not a digital camera of the type that became common in the later decades, although Skylab did have a digital computer using microchips onboard.

It was determined that film would fog up to due to radiation over the course of the mission.<ref name="ntrs.nasa.gov"/> To prevent this film was stored in vaults.<ref name="ntrs.nasa.gov"/>

However, although it was originally planned that Skylab crews would only perform limited maintenance<ref>harvp|Belew|1977|p=34|ps=.</ref> they successfully made major repairs during EVA, such as the SL-2 crew's deployment of the solar panel<ref>harvp|Belew|1977|pp=73–75|ps=.</ref> and the SL-4 crew's repair of the primary coolant loop.<ref>harvp|Benson|Compton|1983|p=317|ps=.</ref><ref>harvp|Belew|1977|p=130|ps=.</ref><ref>harvp|Martin Marietta|Bendix|1978|p=3-21|ps=.</ref> The SL-2 crew fixed one item during EVA by, reportedly, "hit[ting] it with [a] hammer".<ref>harvp|Belew|1977|p=89|ps=.</ref>

Some studies also said, beyond the opportunity for space construction and maintenance experience, reactivating the station would free up shuttle flights for other uses,<ref name=MMB1-13/> and reduce the need to Extended Duration Orbiter|modify the shuttle for long-duration missions.<ref>harvp|Martin Marietta|Bendix|1978|pp=2-9 to 2-10|ps=.</ref> Even if the station were not manned again, went one argument, it might serve as an experimental platform.<ref>harvp|Martin Marietta|Bendix|1978|p=2-61|ps=.</ref>

The reactivation would likely have occurred in four phases:<ref name="oberg199202"/>
# Canceled Space Shuttle missions#STS-2A (Columbia)|An early Space Shuttle flight would have boosted Skylab to a higher orbit, adding five years of operational life.

# In two shuttle flights, Skylab would have been refurbished. In January 1982, the first mission would have attached a docking adapter and conducted repairs. In August 1983, a second crew would have replaced several system components.
# In March 1984, shuttle crews would have attached a solar-powered Power Expansion Package, refurbished scientific equipment, and conducted 30- to 90-day missions using the Apollo Telescope Mount and the earth resources experiments.
# Over five years, Skylab would have been expanded to accommodate six to eight astronauts, with a new large docking/interface module, additional logistics modules, Spacelab modules and pallets, and an orbital vehicle space dock using the shuttle's external tank.

The first three phases would have required about $60 million in 1980s dollars, not including launch costs.

Other options for launching TRS were Titan III or Atlas Agena.<ref name="astronautix.com1"/>

The mission would have launched in April 1974 and supported later use by the Space Shuttle, at the time in development, by boosting the station to higher orbit.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de/cancelled/english/skylab-5.htm|title=Cancelled spaceflight mission: Skylab 5|last=Becker|first=Joachim|website=www.spacefacts.de|access-date=2018-12-03</ref>

Main|Skylab B

In addition to the flown Skylab space station, a second flight-quality backup Skylab space station had been built during the program. NASA considered using it for a second station in May 1973 or later, to be called Skylab B (S-IVB 515), but decided against it. Launching another Skylab with another Saturn V rocket would have been very costly, and it was decided to spend this money on the development of the Space Shuttle instead. The backup is on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

Engineering mock-ups
A full-size training mock-up once used for astronaut training is located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center visitor's center in Houston, Texas.  Another full-size training mock-up is at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.  Originally displayed indoors, it was subsequently stored outdoors for several years to make room for other exhibits.  To mark the 40th anniversary of the Skylab program, the Orbital Workshop portion of the trainer was restored and moved into the Davidson Center in 2013.<ref>cite web |url= http://www.spacecamp.com/mu/exhibits |title= Museum Galleries |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200245/http://www.spacecamp.com/mu/exhibits |archive-date= October 29, 2013</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2013/01/post_1045.html|title= Skylab Engineering Mockup Moves into Saturn V Hall at Space and Rocket Center After 10 Years Outdoors |work= AL.com</ref>  NASA transferred Skylab B|the backup Skylab to the National Air and Space Museum in 1975. On display in the Museum's Space Hall since 1976, the orbital workshop has been slightly modified to permit viewers to walk through the living quarters.<ref>cite web |url= http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19761033000 |title= Orbital Workshop, Skylab, Backup Flight Unit |publisher= Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum </ref>

Mission designations
The numerical identification of the manned Skylab missions was the cause of some confusion. Originally, the unmanned launch of Skylab and the three manned missions to the station were numbered ''SL-1'' through ''SL-4''. During the preparations for the manned missions, some documentation was created with a different scheme—''SLM-1'' through ''SLM-3''—for those missions only. William Pogue credits Pete Conrad with asking the Skylab program director which scheme should be used for the mission patches, and the astronauts were told to use 1-2-3, not 2-3-4. By the time NASA administrators tried to reverse this decision, it was too late, as all the in-flight clothing had already been manufactured and shipped with the 1-2-3 mission patches.<ref>cite web |url= http://williampogue.com/skylab-numbering-mixup.html |title= Skylab Numbering Fiasco |work= WilliamPogue.com</ref>

Program cost
From 1966 to 1974, the Skylab program cost a total of $2.2&nbsp;billion, equivalent to $10&nbsp;billion in 2010 dollars. As its three three-man crews spent 510 total man-days in space, each man-day cost approximately $20&nbsp;million, compared to $7.5&nbsp;million for the International Space Station.<ref name="lafleur20100308">cite news |url= http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1579/1 |title= Costs of US Piloted Programs |work= The Space Review |date= March 8, 2010 |access-date= February 18, 2012 |last= Lafleur |first= Claude See author's correction in comments section.</ref>
