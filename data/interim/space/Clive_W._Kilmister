Clive W. Kilmister (1924 – May 2, 2010) was a British Mathematician who specialised in the mathematical foundations of Physics, especially Quantum Mechanics and Relativity and published widely in these fields (see References). He was one of the discoverers of the Combinatorial hierarchy|Combinatorial Hierarchy, along with Frederick Parker-Rhodes|A. F. Parker-Rhodes,  Ted Bastin|E. W. Bastin, and J.C.Amson. He was strongly influenced by astrophysicist Arthur Eddington and was well known for his elaboration and elucidation of Eddington's Fundamental theory (Eddington)|Fundamental theory.

Kilmister attended Queen Mary College London for both his under- and postgraduate degrees. His 1950 PhD on ''The Use of Quaternions in Wave-Tensor Calculus'' related to Eddington's work, and was supervised by cosmologist George C. McVittie, who was one of Eddington's students.<ref>cite web |url= http://hyperspace.aei.mpg.de/2010/05/31/death-of-clive-kilmister/ |title= Death of Clive Kilmister |accessdate= 2011-09-20 |last= Robinson |first= David |date= 2010-05-31 |work= hyperspace@aei |publisher= Max Planck Society |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110512010404/http://hyperspace.aei.mpg.de/2010/05/31/death-of-clive-kilmister/ |archivedate= 2011-05-12 |df=  </ref>  His own students included Brian Tupper (1959, King's College London, now professor emeritus of general relativity and cosmology at University of New Brunswick Fredericton [https://web.archive.org/web/20110811074000/http://www.unb.ca/fredericton/science/math/Graduate_Program.html]), Samuel Edgar (1977, University of London), and Tony Crilly (reader in mathematical sciences at Middlesex University and author of The Big Questions: Mathematics [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1849162409] (1981).<ref>cite web |url=http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=42259 |title= Clive William Kilmister |accessdate=2011-09-20 |work= The Mathematics Genealogy Project |publisher= North Dakota State University Department of Mathematics </ref>

Kilmister was elected as a member of the London Mathematical Society during his doctoral studies (March 17, 1949).  Upon graduation, he began his career as an Assistant Lecturer in the Mathematics Department of King's College in 1950.  The entirety of his academic career was spent at King's.  In 1954, Kilmister founded the King's Gravitational Theory Group, in concert with Hermann Bondi and Felix Pirani, which focused on Einstein's theory of general relativity.  At retirement, Kilmister was both a Professor of Mathematics and Head of the King's College Mathematics Department.<ref name="multiple">cite web |url= http://old.lms.ac.uk/newsletter/394/394_09.html |title= Clive Kilmister Obituary |accessdate= 2011-09-20 |year= 2010 |page= Deaths |work= London Mathematical Society Newsletter |publisher= London Mathematical Society |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120320023612/http://old.lms.ac.uk/newsletter/394/394_09.html |archivedate= 2012-03-20 |df=  </ref>
