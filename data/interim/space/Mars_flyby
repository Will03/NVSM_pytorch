Concepts
One application of a Mars flyby is for a human mission, where after landing and staying on the surface for some time the ascent stage has a space rendezvous with another, unmanned spacecraft, that was launched separately from Earth, flying by. This  would mean the ascent stage of the lander to reach the speed necessary equal to that of the spacecraft flying by, but the resources needed for Earth return would not have to enter or leave Mars orbit.<ref name="portree2001flyby"/><ref name="Astronautica - FLEM">[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/flem.html Astronautica - FLEM]dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes </ref>

The spacecraft they live in on the journey to Mars does the flyby, but the crew separates and goes into a lander.<ref name="portree2001flyby"/> The Excursion module's ascent stage must rejoin the main spacecraft before it gets too far away.<ref name="portree2001flyby"/> An advantage is that the resources needed for Earth return don't have to enter and leave Mars orbit, but the ascent stage has to perform space rendezvous in solar orbit and the time on Mars is constrained by the need to this.<ref name="portree2001flyby"/><ref name="Astronautica - FLEM"/> Mars cyclers orbit the Sun in such a way as to pass by Mars and the Earth on regular intervals, performing Mars flybys on regular intervals. The crews would live on the stations during the interplanetary voyages. The concept for Flyby Excursion Landing Module is that a lander and flyby would separate in solar orbit, the lander would accelerate to get to Mars first, then land on Mars meanwhile the other segment does a Mars flyby, then the lander takes off and rendezvous with the flyby segment transferring the crew over.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2014/01/to-mars-by-flyby-landing-excursion-mode-flem-1966/ W.I.R.E.D.]</ref> (see also Mars Excursion Module (MEM))

Alternately, a flyby-only human mission is also possible, without detaching at Mars, but to Gravitational slingshot|slingshot around Mars and back to Earth.<ref>Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/dennis-titos-mission-to-mars-launching-in-2018-for-the-children-and-to-beat-china/2013/02/27/4a4a98ce-8135-11e2-8074-b26a871b165a_story.html "Dennis Tito’s mission to Mars: Launching in 2018 for the children (and to beat China)"], Brian Vastag, 27 February 2013</ref>
