Everything (or every thing) is all that existence|exists; the opposite of nothing, or its Opposite (semantics)|complement. It is the totality of things relevant to some theory|subject matter. Without expressed or implied Maxima and minima|limits, it may refer to universal quantifier|anything. The Universe is everything that exists theoretically, though a multiverse may exist according to theoretical cosmology predictions. It may refer to an anthropocentric worldview,<ref name="OED">cite web

Scope
In ordinary conversation, ''everything'' usually refers only to the totality of things relevant to the subject matter.<ref name="OED"/> When there is no expressed limitation, ''everything'' may refer to the universe, the world.

The ''Universe'' is most commonly defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and physical constant|constants that govern them. However, the term "universe" may be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting such concepts as the ''cosmos'', the ''world (philosophy)|world''  or ''Nature''. According to some speculations, this universe may be one of many disconnected universes, which are collectively denoted as the multiverse. In the bubble universe theory, there is an infinite variety of universes, each with different physical constants. In the many-worlds hypothesis, new universes are spawned with every quantum measurement. By definition, these speculations cannot currently be tested experimentally, yet, if theyclarify|reason='they' refers to 'these speculations', which obviously exist.

Especially in a metaphysics|metaphysical context, ''World'' may refer to everything that constitutes reality and the Universe: see World (philosophy). However, world may "only" refer to ''Earth'' envisioned from an anthropocentric or human worldview, as a place by human beings.

In theoretical physics
Main article|Theory of everything
In theoretical physics, a ''theory of everything'' (TOE) is a hypothetical theory that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena. Initially, the term was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of Ijon Tichy—a character from a cycle of Stanisław Lem's science fiction stories of 1960s—was known to work on the "General Theory of Everything". Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of quantum physics to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all fundamental interactions of nature.

There have been many theories of everything proposed by theoretical physicists over the last century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that the accepted theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity are hard to combine. Whereas theories exploring quantum mechanics and string theory are easier to combinecitation needed|date=August 2018. 

Based on theoretical holographic principle arguments from the 1990s, many physicists believe that 11-dimensional M-theory, which is described in many sectors by matrix string theory, and in many other sectors by dual resonance model|perturbative string theory, is the complete theory of everything. Other physicists disagree.

In philosophy

In philosophy, a ''theory of everything'' or ''TOE'' is an ultimate, all-encompassing explanation of nature or reality.<ref name=Rescher2006a>Rescher, Nicholas (2006a).

"Why are the laws of nature as they are?"  "Why is there anything at all?"<ref name=Rescher2006a/>
