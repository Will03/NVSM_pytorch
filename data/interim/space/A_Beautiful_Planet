Astronaut Terry Virts has said that while he was in Outer space|space, 

<blockquote>we did Space research|science and spacewalks and all kinds of things, but I think this movie is the most important thing I did because it brings space to people ...

=The big picture=
Some of the movie's images illustrate geography|geographical realities that are not necessarily obvious from the ground but which are apparent when viewed from space. For example, the circular structure of Lake Manicouagan in Quebec, Canada may not be evident to a person in a kayak paddling along its jagged, indented shoreline. However, an astronaut looking down on this annular lake from the Space Station can clearly see that it is an enormous ring of water;<ref>cite web | url = https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-manicouagan

Seen from above, it's easy to understand why. The remarkable and strangely shaped Lake Manicouagan forms as perfect of a ring as nature is likely to create out of water, circular and rough-edged like a giant coffee ring on the surface of the Earth.</ref> scientists believe that it is the flooded inner ring of an impact crater that formed when a meteor struck the Earth during the Late Triassic. Similarly, a person looking up into the deep blue sky from the Crust (geology)|ground may have the impression that it is a very thick envelope of air surrounding the Earth, but an ISS astronaut looking at the Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere edge-on sees the reality that, compared to the Earth physical characteristics tables|Earth's diameter, it is roughly as thick as the skin on an apple.<ref>cite web | url = http://earth.rice.edu/mtpe/atmo/atmosphere/topics/1_atmomemb.html | title = The atmosphere as a membrane | website = earth.rice.edu | publisher = Rice University | quote = The atmosphere is very small compared to the rest of the planet. The Earth itself is nearly 13,000 km in diameter, but the atmosphere rises only a few tens of kilometers above the surface. If you were to compare the Earth to an ordinary apple, the atmosphere would be only as thick as the apple's skin.</ref>

The film's striking sequence looking down into the Eye (cyclone)|eye of a tropical cyclone reveals how a single image from the Space Station can replace otherwise-murky ideas with sudden clarity. Typhoon Maysak (2015)|Super Typhoon Maysak was an Tropical cyclone scales|extremely powerful typhoon that was filmed from the ISS in the spring of 2015. At peak intensity, its winds were so strong that it would have qualified as a Saffir–Simpson scale|Category 5 hurricane had it developed in the Atlantic Ocean rather than the Tropical cyclone basins|Northwestern Pacific basin. The scene showing this typhoon is narrated by Barry E. Wilmore|Butch Wilmore, speaking with a slight Southern American English|southern drawl which clearly links him to the Southeastern United States,<ref>cite AV media | people = Toni Myers, writer and director | title = A Beautiful Planet | medium = IMAX film | date = April 29, 2016 Wilmore explains in the movie that "I speak three languages: English, Russian and Tennessee."</ref> the US region most impacted by hurricanes. According to Wilmore, when you look down into the Eye (cyclone)|cloud free center of a cyclone, "you see power. A funnel 25 miles in diameter at the center of a hurricane or typhoon [causes you to] realize: ''That's energy. It is powerful, powerful energy.''" He says nothing about severe weather Weather warning|advisories, but the implied message is clear: if you live in a threatened area, don't ignore Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical cyclone warnings, be mindful of Hurricane preparedness|recommended precautions, and Emergency evacuation|evacuate if you are ordered to do so.

''A Beautiful Planet'' is shown on movie screens which literally use big pictures to illustrate geographically superlative locations. For example, it shows an overhead sequence of the Namib | Namib Desert's red sands on the east cleft by the blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean's Skeleton Coast on the west, and repeats the widely accepted idea<ref>cite web | url = http://intelligenttravel.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/12/the-oldest-desert-in-the-world/ | title = The Oldest Desert in the World | last = Westberg | first = Marcus | last2 = Westberg | first2 = Kate | date = March 12, 2013 | website = National Geographic Intelligent Travel - Beyond the Guidebook | quote = With its red dunes rolling endlessly into the ocean, the Namib is the oldest desert in the world - a sea of silica stretching along Namibia's entire Atlantic coast.</ref> that the Namib is the "oldest desert" on Earth.

The movie demonstrates another superlative by showing a snow-capped segment of South America's Andes, "the List of longest mountain chains on Earth|longest [continental] mountain range in the world." Because they stretch across so much varied terrain as they wrap around the globe from Venezuela north of the Equator, through the Tropics, and down to southern Argentina, the Andean Mountains have their own superlatives: they contain "some of the most extreme climate zones on Earth, from ice fields to deserts," and they include Aconcagua, the highest summit|peak in The Americas, as well as the highest in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>cite web | url = https://www.livescience.com/41702-aconcagua.html | title = Aconcagua: Highest Mountain in South America | last = Zimmermann | first = Kim Ann | date = December 8, 2017 | publisher = Live Science | quote = At 22,837 feet (6,961 meters), not only is it the highest mountain in South America, it is the tallest peak in all of the Americas, as well as the Southern and Western Hemispheres.</ref>

A number of the astronauts in ''A Beautiful Planet'' said that it was inevitable they would begin to see parallels between Earth and the Space Station. According to Kjell Lindgren, "The ISS is a microcosm of the Earth ... You have consumable Natural resource|resources, and Sustainability|you have to be mindful of how you use those resources.

In the film, Jennifer Lawrence's narration calls Earth's atmosphere "a delicate cocoon of air that shields us from Sun|our star's radiation." Of course, the atmosphere doesn't completely block electromagnetic radiation from the Sun; without some sunlight reaching the surface, plants could not Photosynthesis|harvest Solar irradiance|the Sun's energy, and practically no life as we know it could exist. The atmosphere's ozone layer does filter out much of the harmful ultraviolet light (or "UV rays") produced by the Sun.

Another impediment to sustaining Earth's long-term habitability is deforestation.

Even though ''A Beautiful Planet'' contains a few dire warnings regarding climate change and environmental degradation, filmmaker Toni Myers wanted primarily to give moviegoers positive reasons why they might take better care of the Earth rather than scaring them.  She has said, "I wanted to inspire people especially as to how beautiful the planet is, how fragile it is, how Complex system|complex and Biodiversity|diverse and varied it is ...

=The astronauts=
The film's cast reflects the fact that the crew of the International Space Station comes from many nations. The astronauts who appeared in the movie included:
Scott Kelly (astronaut)|Scott Kelly (NASA / USA), who spent ISS year long mission|roughly a year in space during a long, uninterrupted stay aboard the International Space Station, Samantha Cristoforetti (European Space Agency / Italy), who has spent more time in an uninterrupted spaceflight than any other European astronaut, Barry E. Wilmore|Barry "Butch" Wilmore (NASA / USA), commander of the Expedition 42|42nd expedition to the ISS from November 10, 2014 to March 11, 2015, Terry Virts (NASA / USA), commander of the Expedition 43|43rd expedition to the ISS from March 11, 2015 to June 11, 2015, Anton Shkaplerov (Roscosmos / Russia), the commander of Soyuz TMA-15M|the Soyuz spacecraft that brought Cristoforetti and Virts to the Space Station, Kjell Lindgren (NASA / USA), a medical doctor who had previously worked as a flight surgeon supporting medical operations and space-station training at NASA's Johnson Space Center,<ref>cite web | url = http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/administration/alumni/CUMedToday/profiles/Pages/KjellLindgren.aspx | title = Alumni Profile for Kjell Lindgren, 'Lofty Ambitions' | last = Spencer | first = Jim | last2 = Meyers | first2 = Dan | website = CU Medicine Today | publisher = University of Colorado School of Medicine</ref> and Kimiya Yui (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency / Japan), a space explorer who was made Head of the JAXA Astronaut Group after he returned from his stay on the Space Station.<ref>cite web | url = http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/astro/biographies/yui/ | title = Biography for JAXA Astronaut Kimiya Yui | date = March 28, 2017 | website = Homepage for the International Space Station Japanese Experiment Module 'Kibo' | publisher = Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency</ref>

There are International Space Station program|five space agencies that operate and pay for the ISS: the Canadian Space Agency | Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the European Space Agency | European Space Agency (ESA), the JAXA|Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the Roscosmos | Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities (Roscosmos), and the NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Of these five, the only agency that did not have an astronaut who appeared on camera in ''A Beautiful Planet'' was the Canadian Space Agency. However, the film would not have been made without essential contributions from Canadians: the IMAX Corporation, the movie company responsible for the film's towering and detailed visual images, is headquartered in Ontario, Canada, and Toni Myers, the movie's writer, director and producer, is also a Canadian.

The position of the Space Station in low Earth orbit is effectively just outside of the Earth's appreciable Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere, and is therefore an excellent  training area in which astronauts can put on space suits, leave the ISS life support systems behind, and conduct spacewalks - or "Extravehicular activity|Extravehicular activity (EVA)." An EVA may be undertaken to International Space Station maintenance|make repairs, Assembly of the International Space Station|reconfigure the Station to accommodate new modules, deploy new equipment, etc. The ISS orbits high enough to permit an astronaut and their sponsoring nation to gain valuable EVA experience outside of the atmosphere, but it is low enough to avoid the Van Allen radiation belt|increased radiation exposure<ref>cite book | last = Virts | first = Terry | author-link = Terry W.

Butch Wilmore and Terry Virts teamed up to perform List of spacewalks since 2015|three spacewalks over a nine day period from February 21 to March 1, 2015, and ''A Beautiful Planet'' shows footage from some of their EVA activities outside the Space Station. While they worked, both explorers were acutely aware that spacewalks are inherently dangerous.

It's the look of realizing we've shared this experience that we both know was at the limit of our abilities and could have killed us.</ref> but many of the significant hazards an astronaut is likely to encounter are predictable and difficult to avoid completely. In the movie Virts explains that possible punctures to their Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU spacesuits were a particular concern because "you 'walk around' by grabbing onto things with your gloves ... The outside of the Space Station [is] a jungle of wires and equipment and metal bars and trusses. If you accidentally sliced your glove or your spacesuit on one of the sharp edges, that could create a leak, and if that leak were big enough, you would die." Describing some of the other EVA hazards, Wilmore elaborates that the temperature is "almost 300 degrees [Fahrenheit] on the Sun side of the Space Station, [but when] you get in the shade, it's minus 275 degrees. You feel that inside the suit. My fingertips in the sunlight would feel like they were on fire almost ... [Also,] you have a safety tether attached to the Station, and it's on a reel ... You can be upside down, twisted, inverted; you can completely lose your spatial awareness about where you are and what your attitude is, and you can easily get tangled up in that safety tether if you're not cautious. Every single movement you make, you're making an effort to think [things] through."

After spending almost the entire film scrutinizing the Earth and the ISS (with its astronauts) in low Earth orbit, one of the final scenes of ''A Beautiful Planet'' briefly examines an important extrasolar planet (a planet outside of Solar System|our solar system) which was discovered in 2014. The planet, Kepler-186f, was the first approximately-Earth-sized planet found to be orbiting within its star's habitable zone, or orbital area where Extraterrestrial liquid water|liquid water could conceivably exist without freezing or Vaporization|vaporizing.

By agreeing to narrate a science-themed IMAX documentary, Lawrence joined a group of acclaimed actors who lent their star power to increase the appeal of similar IMAX films, and who were probably not motivated by the money the project would pay.

The city of Chicago is visible on the shore of Lake Michigan, as are Earth's atmosphere, part of the Space Station, and the approaching sunrise.

Myers and Neihouse coordinated with their astronaut camera crew to take full advantage of the digital cameras' augmented capacity for filming in dim light. According to Myers, "We would not have the nighttime scenes without the digital dynamic range ... What the digital capture did was totally open up that night world to us, with stars, cities at night, lightning and other phenomena that you see at night, like aurora."<ref>cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/29/imax-a-beautiful-planet/ | title = 'A Beautiful Planet' offers a bold new look at Earth in IMAX 3D: The first IMAX space film shot with digital cameras is simply stunning. | last = Hardawar | first = Devindra | date = April 29, 2016 | website = Engadget</ref>

Despite the fact that the digital cameras were state of the art, they may have simply turned out to be very, very expensive disposable cameras. The total cost of sending a single kilogram of supplies to the Space Station may exceed $20,000,<ref>cite book | last = Virts | first = Terry | author-link = Terry W.

Once the movie's production team had downloaded the image sequences, it is quite possible the cameras themselves were incinerated in one of the ISS "trash dumps" aboard a Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus resupply ship.<ref>cite news | last = Moynihan | first = Tim | title = A Beautiful Planet: Shooting IMAX Is Hard Enough On Earth.
