Science tourism is a travel topic grouping scientific attractions. It covers interests in visiting and exploring scientific landmarks, including museums, laboratories, observatories and universities.<ref name="NYT-20180528" /><ref name="NYT-20181112" />

Access
Many of the listed laboratories have ongoing scientific research, and may not be open to the general public, although they may offer occasional special public access opportunities. Observatories are usually open to the public and have tours showcasing their astronomical research.<ref name="NYT-20180528">cite news |last=Kujawinski |first=Peter |title=Colliders, Sundials and Wonder: When Science Is Your Destination - At CERN in Switzerland and Fermilab in Illinois, there is always a sense of discovery — about the past, present and future. - Science Tourism - part 1 of 2 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/travel/science-tourism-cern-fermilab.html |date=28 May 2018 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 November 2018 </ref><ref name="NYT-20181112">cite news |last=Kujawinski |first=Peter |title=Where Will Science Take Us?

* James Clerk Maxwell's Birthplace and Museum – Edinburgh's answer to Newton and Einstein. His equations unified the forces of Electricity and Magnetism and paved the way for Einstein's theory of special relativity. From the website "Modern technology, in large part, stems from his grasp of the basic principles of the universe. Wide ranging developments in the field of electricity and electronics, including radio, television, radar and communications, derive from Maxwell's discovery of the laws of the electromagnetic field - which was not a synthesis of what was known before, but rather a fundamental change in concept that departed from Newton's view and was to influence greatly the modern scientific and industrial revolution."

It started as a particle physics laboratory, became involved for the study of nuclear matter and discovered 16 chemical elements. It is today a multi-program research site. Visitors need special clearance or may take advantage of the open days. The site on top of the hill nicely overlooks the San Francisco Bay.

Universities
The most prestigious universities generally attract excellent scientists and have fine science programs. University campuses are usually open to the public, though permission from guards is sometimes required, and there may be some café or cafeteria or mensa or restaurant or even a university shop on site. Universities usually offer public lectures about ongoing research. Otherwise, their seminars and buildings are reserved for the students and the working faculty including post-doctoral researchers or professors. On weekends or holidays, many universities require special permits to enter. Universities compete on a worldwide basis; hence, they are not ordered by geographical position or alphabetized. Below is a list of the 20 highest-ranked universities according to 2013/2014 QS world university ranking (of course rankings may differ according to year and specific subject).

* Boltzmann's grave – The Boltzmann equation was originally formulated by Ludwig Boltzmann between 1872 to 1875. It relates the entropy S of an ideal gas to the quantity W, which is the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate. In the ideal gas limit it exactly corresponds to the proper thermodynamic entropy.
