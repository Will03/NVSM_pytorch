This is a list of megaprojects. "Megaprojects are temporary endeavours (i.e. projects) characterized by: large investment commitment, vast complexity (especially in organizational terms), and long-lasting impact on the economy, the environment, and society".<ref>Cite journal|last=Brookes|first=Naomi J.|last2=Locatelli|first2=Giorgio|date=2015-10-01|title=Power plants as megaprojects: Using empirics to shape policy, planning, and construction management|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/90267/|journal=Utilities Policy|volume=36|pages=57–66|doi=10.1016/j.jup.2015.09.005</ref> The number of such projects is so large that the list may never be fully completed.

Definitions
Megaprojects may be defined as:
* Projects that cost more than US$1 billion and attract a large amount of public attention because of substantial impacts on communities, Natural environment|environment, and budgets.
* Projects can also be "initiatives that are physical, very expensive, and public".<ref name="altshuler">cite book |last=Altshuler |first=Alan |last2=Luberoff |first2=David |title=Mega-Projects: The Changing Politics of Urban Public Investment |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |date=30 April 2003 |isbn=978-0-8157-0129-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZY5vCO06NQC</ref>

Megaprojects require care in the project development process to reduce any possible optimism bias and strategic misrepresentation. Examples of megaprojects include bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, Special Economic Zones (SEZ), oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and weapons systems.

This list identifies a wide variety of examples of major historic and contemporary projects that meet one or both megaproject criteria identified above.

* General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, a single seat, single turbofan, high performance, multi-role fighter. It is by far one of the most popular and most common jet fighters in the world, active from 1978 to present with General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon operators|operators in 26 countries.

While most megaprojects are planned and undertaken with careful forethought, some are undertaken out of necessity after a natural disaster occurs. There have also been a few Anthropogenic hazard|man-made disasters.
* The Chernobyl New Safe Confinement is being built to enclose the #4 reactor that was destroyed in the Chernobyl disaster of 1986.
* The Fukushima disaster cleanup is ongoing, and includes the removal of spent nuclear fuel stored at the site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.
* Cleaning up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill, Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill, and AZF (factory)|AZF chemical factory explosion were megaprojects.
* Storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is designed to prevent a disaster from leaking nuclear waste.
* Many hurricanes and typhoons have caused extensive damage and required large cleanup efforts, the largest of which included projects that targeted the damaged infrastructure. The list of costliest Atlantic hurricanes covers the ones in the Atlantic region, including Hurricane Katrina from 2005.
* Many earthquakes (and resultant tsunamis) have caused enough damage to infrastructure that enormous projects were undertaken. The 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami are some of the most notorious and recent events that led to a megaproject.
