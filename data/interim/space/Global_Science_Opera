The Global Science Opera (GSO) is a creative education initiative that combines science, art, technology, and education in a global network of scientists, art and education institutions and projects. Using digital interaction, schools, universities and art and institutions from over 30 participating countries perform and live-stream Global Science Opera performances.<ref>cite web|title=Global Science Opera - About|url=http://globalscienceopera.com/about/|website=Global Science Opera|accessdate=8 April 2017</ref> One team in each participating country is invited to develop a two-minute scene for the opera, with all the scenes being performed together on a designated date as a continuous, real-time event that viewers can watch online.

History

Global Science Opera began in May 2014 as a collaboration between the European Commission’s CREAT-IT project<ref>cite web|title=CREAT-IT joins the International Year of Light|url=http://www.reseo.org/ARTICLE/CREAT-IT-JOINS-INTERNATIONAL-YEAR-LIGHT|website=RESEO European Network for Opera and Dance Education|accessdate=8 April 2017</ref><ref>cite web|title=SkyLight - A Global Science Opera|url=http://www.light2015.org/Home/Event-Programme/2015/Other/Norway-SkyLight---a-Global-Science-Opera.html|website=2015 International Year of Light and Light-Based Technologies|accessdate=8 April 2017</ref> and representatives of the following initiatives:
* Write a Science Opera (WASO): A creative approach to science and art inquiry in schools, developed at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences<ref>cite web|title=CREAT-IT joins the International Year of Light|url=http://www.reseo.org/ARTICLE/CREAT-IT-JOINS-INTERNATIONAL-YEAR-LIGHT|website=RESEO European Network for Opera and Dance Education</ref><ref>cite web|title=SkyLight - A Global Science Opera|url=http://www.epsnews.eu/2015/05/skylight-a-global-science-opera/|website=European Physical Society|accessdate=8 April 2017</ref>
* The Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP) and Global Hands-On Universe (GHOU): Global networks of  science teachers<ref>cite web|title=CREAT-IT joins the International Year of Light|url=http://www.reseo.org/ARTICLE/CREAT-IT-JOINS-INTERNATIONAL-YEAR-LIGHT|website=RESEO European Network for Opera and Dance Education|accessdate=8 April 2017</ref><ref>cite web|title=Moon Village Opera|url=http://galileoteachers.org/moon-village-opera/|website=Galileo Teacher Training Program|accessdate=8 April 2017</ref>
* Distance Learning: ICT-based connections amongst rural schools, led by the educational organization Ellinogermaniki Agogi in Athens, Greece
Their idea for the first Global Science Opera production, “SkyLight”, was proposed to the International Astronomical Union as an official initiative of the International Year of Light 2015.<ref>cite web|title=SkyLight – a Global Science Opera|url=http://www.epsnews.eu/2015/05/skylight-a-global-science-opera/|website=European Physical Society|accessdate=8 April 2017</ref><ref>cite web|title=CREAT-IT joins the International Year of Light|url=http://www.reseo.org/ARTICLE/CREAT-IT-JOINS-INTERNATIONAL-YEAR-LIGHT|website=RESEO European Network for Opera and Dance Education</ref>
After the proposal’s approval in July 2014, a network of institutions in 38 countries, encompassing schools, universities, operas, and science and art institutions, were invited to participate in the first GSO production. Preparation took place between July 2014 and October 2015, based on a flat hierarchy infrastructure and the philosophy “Democracy, respect and friendship was, and will be, the heart of this community.”<ref>cite web|title=About - Global Science Opera|url=http://globalscienceopera.com/about/|website=Global Science Opera|accessdate=8 April 2017</ref>
In 2016, GSO was announced as a flagship initiative of the European Commission’s project “Developing an Engaging Science Classroom (CREATIONS)” and is a Case Study in the Norwegian Research Council’s project “Integrating Science of Ocean’s, Physics and Education (iSCOPE)”.<ref>cite web|title=Science on a Worldwide Stage|url=http://galileoteachers.org/science-on-a-worldwide-stage/|website=Galileo Teacher Training Program|accessdate=8 April 2017</ref>
