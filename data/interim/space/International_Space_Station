In view are the station's four large, gold-coloured solar array wings, two on either side of the station, mounted to a central truss structure. Further along the truss are six large, white radiators, three next to each pair of arrays. In between the solar arrays and radiators is a cluster of pressurised modules arranged in an elongated T shape, also attached to the truss. A set of blue solar arrays are mounted to the module at the aft end of the cluster.

The ISS is the ninth space station to be inhabited by crews, following the Soviet and later Russian ''Salyut programme|Salyut'', ''Almaz'', and ''Mir'' stations as well as ''Skylab'' from the US. The station has been continuously occupied for age in years and days|2 November 2000|sep=and since the arrival of Expedition 1 on 2 November 2000. This is the longest continuous human presence in low Earth orbit, having surpassed the previous record of age in years and days|5 September 1989|28 August 1999|sep=and held by ''Mir''. It has been visited by astronauts, cosmonauts and space tourists from List of International Space Station visitors|18 different nations. After the American Space Shuttle programme ended in 2011, Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rockets became the only provider of transport for astronauts at the ISS.

The station is serviced by a variety of visiting spacecraft: the Russian Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz and Progress (spacecraft)|Progress, the American SpaceX Dragon|Dragon and Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle,<ref name="ISSRG" /> and formerly the American Space Shuttle and the European Automated Transfer Vehicle. The Dragon spacecraft allows the return of pressurised cargo to Earth (downmass), which is used for example to repatriate scientific experiments for further analysis. The Soyuz return capsule has minimal downmass capability next to the astronauts.

Purpose
According to the original Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and Rosaviakosmos, the International Space Station was intended to be a laboratory, observatory and factory in low Earth orbit. It was also planned to provide transportation, maintenance, and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars and asteroids.<ref name="RSA-MOU">cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_rsa.html |title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Russian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station |publisher=NASA |accessdate=19 April 2009 |date=29 January 1998</ref> In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, the ISS was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic<ref>cite journal |last=Payette |first=Julie |title=Research and Diplomacy 350 Kilometers above the Earth: Lessons from the International Space Station |journal=Science & Diplomacy |date=10 December 2012 |volume=1 |issue=4 |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2012/research-and-diplomacy-350-kilometers-above-earth</ref> and educational purposes.<ref name=USNSP>cite web |title=National Space Policy of the United States of America |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |publisher=White House; USA Federal government |accessdate=20 July 2011</ref>

The ISS provides a platform to conduct scientific research. Small unmanned spacecraft can provide platforms for zero gravity and exposure to space, but space stations offer a long-term environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades<!--<ref name="jaxa">cite web |url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/iss/doc01_e.html |title=What is International Space Station? |publisher=iss.jaxa.jp |accessdate=27 May 2014</ref>-->, combined with ready access by human researchers over periods that exceed the capabilities of manned spacecraft.<ref name="10th">cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/10th_anniversary.html |title=Nations Around the World Mark 10th Anniversary of International Space Station |publisher=NASA |date=17 November 2008 |accessdate=6 March 2009</ref><ref name="Worldbook at NASA" />

The ISS simplifies individual experiments by eliminating the need for separate rocket launches and research staff.

To detect dark matter and answer other fundamental questions about our universe, engineers and scientists from all over the world built the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), which NASA compares to the Hubble Space Telescope, and says could not be accommodated on a free flying satellite platform partly because of its power requirements and data bandwidth needs.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/amsprocessing.html NASA – AMS to Focus on Invisible Universe].

Medical research improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body, including muscle atrophy, Osteoporosis|bone loss, and fluid shift. This data will be used to determine whether lengthy human spaceflight and space colonisation are feasible. As of|2006, data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggest that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise, such as the six-month interval required to Manned mission to Mars|travel to Mars.<ref name="JCB">cite book |author=Jay Buckey |title=Space Physiology |publisher=Oxford University Press USA |date=23 February 2006 |isbn=978-0-19-513725-5</ref><ref>cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17476-ion-engine-could-one-day-power-39day-trips-to-mars.html?full=true |work=New Scientist |accessdate=8 January 2010 |date=24 July 2009 |author=List Grossman |title=Ion engine could one day power 39-day trips to Mars</ref>
Medical studies are conducted aboard the ISS on behalf of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI). Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity study in which astronauts perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts. The study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space. Usually, there is no physician on board the ISS and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge. It is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=1 October 2009 |author=Brooke Boen |publisher=NASA |title=Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029061057/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html |archivedate=29 October 2009</ref><ref>cite journal |author=Sishir Rao |display-authors=etal |year=2008 |title=A Pilot Study of Comprehensive Ultrasound Education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine |journal=Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine |volume=27 |pages=745–749 |pmid=18424650 |issue=5</ref><ref>cite journal |author=Michael Fincke |display-authors=etal |year=2004 |title=Evaluation of Shoulder Integrity in Space: First Report of Musculoskeletal US on the International Space Station |journal=Radiology |issue=2 |pages=319–322 |pmid=15533948 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2342041680 |volume=234</ref>

* Drag from the residual atmosphere; when the ISS enters the Earth's shadow, the main solar panels are rotated to minimise this aerodynamic drag, helping reduce orbital decay.
* Vibration from movements of mechanical systems and the crew.
* Actuation of the on-board attitude control moment gyroscopes.
* Rocket engine|Thruster firings for altitude or orbital changes.
* Gravity-gradient stabilization|Gravity-gradient effects, also known as tidal force|tidal effects. Items at different locations within the ISS would, if not attached to the station, follow slightly different orbits. Being mechanically interconnected these items experience small forces that keep the station moving as a rigid body.

Researchers are investigating the effect of the station's near-weightless environment on the evolution, development, growth and internal processes of plants and animals. In response to some of this data, NASA wants to investigate microgravity's effects on the growth of three-dimensional, human-like tissues, and the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space.<ref name="NASA Fields of Research" />

Investigating the physics of fluids in microgravity will provide better models of the behaviour of fluids. Because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity, physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on Earth. In addition, examining reactions that are slowed by low gravity and low temperatures will improve our understanding of superconductivity.<ref name="NASA Fields of Research" />

The study of materials science is an important ISS research activity, with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on the ground.<ref>cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/msad15sep99_1.htm |title=Materials Science 101 |publisher=Science@NASA |accessdate=18 June 2009 |date=15 September 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614033947/http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/msad15sep99_1.htm |archivedate=14 June 2009</ref> Other areas of interest include the effect of the low gravity environment on combustion, through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants. These findings may improve current knowledge about energy production, and lead to economic and environmental benefits. Future plans are for the researchers aboard the ISS to examine aerosols, ozone, water vapour, and oxides in Earth's atmosphere, as well as cosmic rays, cosmic dust, antimatter, and dark matter in the universe.<ref name="NASA Fields of Research" />

The ISS provides a location in the relative safety of Low Earth Orbit to test spacecraft systems that will be required for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. This provides experience in operations, maintenance as well as repair and replacement activities on-orbit, which will be essential skills in operating spacecraft farther from Earth, mission risks can be reduced and the capabilities of interplanetary spacecraft advanced.<ref name="ResProg"/> Referring to the MARS-500 experiment, ESA states that "Whereas the ISS is essential for answering questions concerning the possible impact of weightlessness, radiation and other space-specific factors, aspects such as the effect of long-term isolation and confinement can be more appropriately addressed via ground-based simulations".<ref name="esa mars500 ">cite web |title=Mars500 study overview |publisher=ESA |date=4 June 2011 |url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Mars500/SEM7W9XX3RF_0.html</ref> Sergey Krasnov, the head of human space flight programmes for Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, in 2011 suggested a "shorter version" of MARS-500 may be carried out on the ISS.<!--there are better refs for this including the mention of 2014–2015 I think --><ref name="Mars thing on ISS">cite web |title=Space station may be site for next mock Mars mission |url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2011/11/space-station-may-be-site-for.html |date=4 November 2011 |work=New Scientist</ref>

''First Orbit'' is a feature-length documentary film about Vostok 1, the first manned space flight around the Earth. By matching the orbit of the International Space Station to that of Vostok 1 as closely as possible, in terms of ground path and time of day, documentary filmmaker Christopher Riley and ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli were able to film the view that Yuri Gagarin saw on his pioneering orbital space flight. This new footage was cut together with the original Vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the Russian State Archive.

Manufacturing
File:SSPF_interior.jpg|thumb|ISS module Node 2 manufacturing and processing in the SSPF
Since the International Space Station is a multi-national collaborative project, the components for in-orbit assembly had to be manufactured in various factories around the world. The U.S. Modules (''Destiny'',''Tranquillity'', ''Unity'' and ''Harmony'') as well as the Integrated Truss Structure and Electrical system of the International Space Station|solar arrays were fabricated at the Marshall Space Flight Center and the Michoud Assembly Facility, beginning in the mid 1990s. The modules were delivered to the Operations and Checkout Building, and the Space Station Processing Facility at Kennedy Space Center for final assembly and processing for launch.<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/history/stations/images/manufacturing-key-parts-of-ISS-unity-and-destiny</ref> Steel and aluminum sections of the truss were part contracted by Alcoa and ArcelorMittal USA, along with Boeing. 

Russian modules - ''Zarya'' and ''Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda'' for example, were manufactured at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center in Moscow. Zvezda was initially manufactured in 1985 as a component for Mir-2, but was never launched and instead became the ISS Service Module. The European Space Agency Columbus module was manufactured at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in the Netherlands, along with many other contractors throughout Europe.<ref>https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/International_Space_Station/Companies_involved_with_ISS</ref>

The Japanese Experiment Module ''Kibo'', was fabricated in various technology manufacturing facilities in Japan, at the National Space Development Agency of Japan|NASDA (now JAXA) Tanegashima Space Center and the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science. The Kibo module was flown by aircraft to the KSC Space Station Processing Facility, along with the ESA Columbus laboratory for shuttle launch on STS-124 and STS-122 respectively.

The Mobile Servicing System - consisting of the Canadarm-2 and the ''Dextre'' grapple fixture, were manufactured at various factories in Canada and the United States. The mobile base system - the connecting framework for Canadarm-2 mounted on rails, was built by Northrop Grumman in Carpinteria, CA. The Canadarm-2 and ''Dextre'' was made by MDA Space Missions, a satellite and aerospace factory in Brampton Ontario, under contract by the Canadian Space Agency and NASA.<ref>https://mdacorporation.com/</ref>

The first module of the ISS, ''Zarya'', was launched on 20 November 1998 on an autonomous Russian Proton (rocket)|Proton rocket. It provided propulsion, attitude control, communications, electrical power, but lacked long-term life support functions. Two weeks later, a passive NASA module ''Unity (ISS module)|Unity'' was launched aboard Space Shuttle flight STS-88 and attached to ''Zarya'' by astronauts during EVAs. This module has two Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMAs), one connects permanently to ''Zarya'', the other allows the Space Shuttle to dock to the space station. At that time, the Russian station ''Mir'' was still inhabited. The ISS remained unmanned for two years, while ''Mir'' was de-orbited. On 12 July 2000, ''Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda'' was launched into orbit. Preprogrammed commands on board deployed its solar arrays and communications antenna. It then became the passive target for a rendezvous with ''Zarya'' and ''Unity'': it maintained a station-keeping orbit while the ''Zarya''-''Unity'' vehicle performed the rendezvous and docking via ground control and the Russian automated rendezvous and docking system. ''Zarya'''s computer transferred control of the station to ''Zvezda'''s computer soon after docking. ''Zvezda'' added sleeping quarters, a toilet, kitchen, CO<sub>2</sub> scrubbers, dehumidifier, oxygen generators, exercise equipment, plus data, voice and television communications with mission control. This enabled permanent habitation of the station.<ref>[http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/servmod.pdf NASA Facts.

Expedition 1 arrived midway between the flights of STS-92 and STS-97. These two Space Shuttle flights each added segments of the station's Integrated Truss Structure, which provided the station with Ku-band communication for US television, additional attitude support needed for the additional mass of the USOS, and substantial solar arrays supplementing the station's existing 4 solar arrays.<ref>cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-92/mission-sts-92.html |title=STS-92 |publisher=Science.ksc.nasa.gov |accessdate=19 April 2011</ref>

Over the next two years, the station continued to expand. A Soyuz-U rocket delivered the Pirs (ISS module)|''Pirs'' docking compartment. The Space Shuttles ''Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery'', ''Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis'', and ''Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour'' delivered the Destiny (ISS module)|''Destiny'' laboratory and Quest Joint Airlock|''Quest'' airlock, in addition to the station's main robot arm, the ''Canadarm2'', and several more segments of the Integrated Truss Structure.

The expansion schedule was interrupted by the OV|102 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|disaster in 2003 and a resulting two-year hiatus in the Space Shuttle programme. The space shuttle was grounded until 2005 with STS-114 flown by ''Discovery''.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2005/07/discovery-launches-the-shuttle-is-back/ |title=Discovery launches—The Shuttle is back |author=Chris Bergin |publisher=NASASpaceflight.com |accessdate=6 March 2009 |date=26 July 2005</ref>

Assembly resumed in 2006 with the arrival of STS-115 with ''Atlantis'', which delivered the station's second set of solar arrays. Several more truss segments and a third set of arrays were delivered on STS-116, STS-117, and STS-118. As a result of the major expansion of the station's power-generating capabilities, more pressurised modules could be accommodated, and the ''Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony'' node and ''Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus'' European laboratory were added. These were soon followed by the first two components of ''Kibo (ISS module)|Kibō''. In March 2009, STS-119 completed the Integrated Truss Structure with the installation of the fourth and final set of solar arrays. The final section of ''Kibō'' was delivered in July 2009 on STS-127, followed by the Russian ''Poisk (ISS module)|Poisk'' module. The third node, ''Tranquility (ISS module)|Tranquility'', was delivered in February 2010 during STS-130 by the Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'', alongside the Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola, followed in May 2010 by the penultimate Russian module, ''Rassvet (ISS module)|Rassvet''. ''Rassvet'' was delivered by Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'' on STS-132 in exchange for the Russian Proton delivery of the ''Zarya'' module in 1998 which had been funded by the United States.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/iss_mim1.html |title=Mini-Research Module 1 (MIM1) Rassvet (MRM-1) |publisher=Russianspaceweb.com |accessdate=12 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825094354/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/iss_mim1.html |archivedate=25 August 2011</ref> The last pressurised module of the USOS, ''Leonardo (ISS module)|Leonardo'', was brought to the station by ''Discovery'' on her final flight, STS-133, in February 2011.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts133/main/index.html |title=STS-133 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=1 September 2014</ref> The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer was delivered by ''Endeavour'' on STS-134 the same year.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts134/main/index.html |title=STS-134 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=1 September 2014</ref>

As of|2011|06, the station consisted of 15 pressurised modules and the Integrated Truss Structure. Five modules are still to be launched, including the ''Nauka (ISS module)|Nauka'' with the European Robotic Arm, the Uzlovoy Module, and two power modules called Science-Power Module-1|NEM-1 and NEM-2.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/nem.html |title=Russia works on a new-generation space module |work=Russianspaceweb.com |accessdate=29 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408182926/http://russianspaceweb.com/nem.html |archivedate=8 April 2016</ref> As of|2017|8, Russia's future primary research module ''Nauka'' is set to launch in November 2019, along with the European Robotic Arm which will be able to relocate itself to different parts of the Russian modules of the station. After the ''Nauka'' module is attached, the Uzlovoy Module will be attached to one of its docking ports. When completed, the station will have a mass of more than convert|400|t|ST|-1.<ref name="OnOrbit" />

The gross mass of the station changes over time. The total launch mass of the modules on orbit is about convert|417289|kg|lbs|abbr=on (as of|2011|September|3|lc=y).<ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/isstodate.html |title=NASA – The ISS to Date (03/09/2011) |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=12 July 2011</ref> The mass of experiments, spare parts, personal effects, crew, foodstuff, clothing, propellants, water supplies, gas supplies, docked spacecraft, and other items add to the total mass of the station. Hydrogen gas is constantly vented overboard by the oxygen generators.

=''Zarya''=
File:Zarya from STS-88.jpg|thumb|upright|''Zarya'' as seen by Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'' during STS-88
''Zarya'' (lang-rus|Заря́; lit|dawn), also known as the Functional Cargo Block or FGB (from the Russian "Функционально-грузовой блок", Funktsionalno-gruzovoy blok or ФГБ), was the first module of the International Space Station to be launched. The FGB provided electrical power, storage, propulsion, and guidance to the ISS during the initial stage of assembly. With the launch and assembly in orbit of other modules with more specialised functionality, ''Zarya'' is now primarily used for storage, both inside the pressurised section and in the externally mounted fuel tanks. ''Zarya'' is a descendant of the TKS (spacecraft)|TKS spacecraft designed for the Soviet Salyut programme. The name ''Zarya'' was given to the FGB because it signified the dawn of a new era of international co-operation in space. Although it was built by a Russian company, it is owned by the United States. ''Zarya'' weighs convert|19300|kg|lb|abbr=on, is convert|12.55|m|ft|abbr=on long and convert|4.1|m|ft|abbr=on wide, discounting solar arrays.

''Zarya'' was built from December 1994 to January 1998 at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center (KhSC) in Moscow. The control system was developed by the Ukrainian Khartron corporation in Kharkiv.

''Zarya'' was launched on 20 November 1998, on a Russian Proton-K|Proton rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81 in Kazakhstan to a convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on high orbit with a designed lifetime of at least 15 years. After ''Zarya'' reached orbit, STS-88 launched on 4 December 1998, to attach the ''Unity'' module.

Although only designed to fly autonomously for six to eight months, ''Zarya'' did so for almost two years because of delays with the Russian Service Module, ''Zvezda'', which finally launched on 12 July 2000, and docked with ''Zarya'' on 26 July using the Russian Kurs (docking system)|Kurs docking system.

=''Unity''=
File:ISS Unity module.jpg|thumb|left|''Unity'' as pictured by Space Shuttle ''Endeavour''
''Unity (ISS module)|Unity'', or Node 1, is one of three nodes, or passive connecting modules, in the US Orbital Segment of the station. It was the first US-built component of the Station to be launched. The module is made of aluminium and cylindrical in shape, with six berthing locations facilitating connections to other modules. Essential space station resources such as fluids, environmental control and life support systems, electrical and data systems are routed through ''Unity'' to supply work and living areas of the station. More than 50,000 mechanical items, 216 lines to carry fluids and gases, and 121 internal and external electrical cables using six miles of wire were installed in the ''Unity'' node. Prior to its launch, conical Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMAs) were attached to the aft and forward berthing mechanisms of ''Unity''. ''Unity'' and the two mating adapters together weighed about convert|25600|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on. The adapters allow the docking systems used by the Space Shuttle and by Russian modules to attach to the node's hatches and berthing mechanisms.

''Unity'' was carried into orbit by OV|105 in 1998 as the primary cargo of STS-88, the first Space Shuttle mission dedicated to assembly of the station. On 6 December 1998, the STS-88 crew mated the aft berthing port of ''Unity'' with the forward hatch of the already orbiting ''Zarya'' module.

''Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny'', also known as the U.S. Lab, is the primary research facility for United States payloads aboard the ISS. In 2011, NASA chose the not-for-profit group Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) to be the sole manager of all American science on the station which does not relate to manned exploration. The module houses 24 International Standard Payload Racks, some of which are used for environmental systems and crew daily living equipment.

''Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony'', also known as Node 2, is the second of the station's node modules and the utility hub of the USOS. The module contains four racks that provide electrical power, bus electronic data, and acts as a central connecting point for several other components via its six Common Berthing Mechanisms (CBMs). The European ''Columbus'' and Japanese ''Kibō'' laboratories are permanently berthed to the starboard and port radial ports respectively. The nadir and zenith ports can be used for docking visiting spacecraft including HTV, Dragon, and Cygnus, with the nadir port serving as the primary docking port. American Shuttle Orbiters docked with the ISS via PMA-2, attached to the forward port.

''Kibo (ISS module)|Kibō'' (lang-ja|きぼう, "hope") is a laboratory and the largest ISS module. It is used for research in space medicine, biology, Earth observations, materials production, biotechnology and communications, and has facilities for growing plants and fish. During August 2011, the MAXI (ISS Experiment)|MAXI observatory mounted on ''Kibō'', which uses the ISS's orbital motion to image the whole sky in the X-ray spectrum, detected for the first time the moment when a star was swallowed by a black hole.<ref>cite web |author=JAXA |url=http://kibo.jaxa.jp/en/experiment/ef/maxi/ |title=Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI): Experiment – Kibo Japanese Experimental Module – JAXA |publisher=Kibo.jaxa.jp |date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=1 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428073043/http://kibo.jaxa.jp/en/experiment/ef/maxi/ |archivedate=28 April 2012</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2011/08/20110825_maxi_e.html |title=JAXA &#124; Scientific paper in Nature using the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) on Kibo and the Swift satellite (USA) observations – First observation of a massive black hole swallowing a star |publisher=Jaxa.jp |accessdate=1 May 2012</ref> The laboratory contains 23 racks, including 10 experiment racks, and has a dedicated airlock for experiments. In a 'shirt sleeves' environment, crew attach an experiment to the sliding drawer within the airlock, close the inner, and then open the outer hatch. By extending the drawer and removing the experiment using the dedicated robotic arm, payloads are placed on the external platform. The process can be reversed and repeated quickly, allowing access to maintain external experiments without the delays caused by EVAs.

A smaller pressurised module is attached to the top of ''Kibō'', serving as a cargo bay. The dedicated Interorbital Communications System (ICS) allows large amounts of data to be beamed from ''Kibō'''s ICS, first to the Japanese KODAMA satellite in geostationary orbit, then to Japanese ground stations. When a direct communication link is used, contact time between the ISS and a ground station is limited to approximately 10 minutes per visible pass. When KODAMA relays data between a LEO spacecraft and a ground station, real-time communications are possible in 60% of the flight path of the spacecraft. Japanese ground controllers use telepresence robotics to remotely conduct onboard research and experiments, thus reducing the workload of station astronauts. Ground controllers also use a free-floating autonomous Int-Ball|ball camera to photodocument astronaut and space station activities, further freeing up astronaut time.

Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola is a seven-window observatory, used to view Earth and docking spacecraft. Its name derives from the Italian word ''cupola'', which means "dome". The Cupola project was started by NASA and Boeing, but cancelled due to budget cuts. A barter agreement between NASA and ESA led to ESA resuming development of Cupola in 1998. It was built by Thales Alenia Space in Turin, Italy. The module comes equipped with robotic workstations for operating the station's main robotic arm and shutters to protect its windows from damage caused by micrometeorites. It features 7 windows, with an convert|80|cm|in|adj=on round window, the largest window on the station (and the largest flown in space to date).

''Nauka'' contains an additional set of life support systems and attitude control. Originally it would have routed power from the single Science-and-Power Platform, but that single module design changed over the first ten years of the ISS mission, and the two science modules, which attach to ''Nauka'' via the Uzlovoy Module, or Russian node, each incorporate their own large solar arrays to power Russian science experiments in the ROS.

''Nauka'''s mission has changed over time. During the mid-1990s, it was intended as a backup for the FGB, and later as a universal docking module (UDM); its docking ports will be able to support automatic docking of both spacecraft, additional modules and fuel transfer. ''Nauka'' has its own engines. Like ''Zvezda'' and ''Zarya'', ''Nauka'' will be launched by a Proton rocket, while smaller Russian modules such as ''Pirs'' and ''Poisk'' were delivered by modified Progress (spacecraft)|Progress spacecraft. Russia plans to separate ''Nauka'', along with the rest of the Russian Orbital Segment, to form the OPSEK space station before the ISS is deorbited.

UM is due to be launched in late 2018. It will be integrated with a special version of the Progress cargo ship and launched by a standard Soyuz rocket. Progress would use its own propulsion and flight control system to deliver and dock the Node Module to the nadir (Earth-facing) docking port of the ''Nauka'' MLM/FGB-2 module. One port is equipped with an active hybrid docking port, which enables docking with the MLM module. The remaining five ports are passive hybrids, enabling docking of Soyuz and Progress vehicles, as well as heavier modules and future spacecraft with modified docking systems. The node module was conceived to serve as the only permanent element of the future Russian successor to the ISS, Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex|OPSEK. Equipped with six docking ports, the Node Module would serve as a single permanent core of the future station with all other modules coming and going as their life span and mission required.<ref>[http://www.energia.ru/en/news/news-2011/news_01-13.html S.P.

The Russian segment of the station, like the Space Shuttle and most spacecraft, uses 28&nbsp;volt&nbsp;direct current|DC from four rotating solar arrays mounted on ''Zarya'' and ''Zvezda''. The USOS uses 130–180&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC from the USOS&nbsp;PV array, power is stabilised and distributed at 160&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC and converted to the user-required 124&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC. The High voltage|higher distribution voltage allows smaller, lighter conductors, at the expense of crew safety. The ROS uses Extra-low voltage|low voltage; the two station segments share power with converters.

The USOS solar arrays are arranged as four wing pairs, for a total production of 75 to 90 kilowatts.<ref>cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/facts-and-figures |title=Facts and Figures |publisher=NASA |first=Mark |last=Garcia |date=28 April 2016 |access-date=24 May 2017</ref> These arrays normally track the sun to maximise power generation. Each array is about convert|375|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on in area and convert|58|m|ft|0|abbr=on long. In the complete configuration, the solar arrays track the sun by rotating the ''alpha gimbal'' once per orbit; the ''beta gimbal'' follows slower changes in the angle of the sun to the orbital plane. The Night Glider mode aligns the solar arrays parallel to the ground at night to reduce the significant aerodynamic drag at the station's relatively low orbital altitude.<ref>cite journal |author=G.

The station's large solar panels generate a high potential voltage difference between the station and the ionosphere. This could cause arcing through insulating surfaces and sputtering of conductive surfaces as ions are accelerated by the spacecraft plasma sheath. To mitigate this, plasma contactor units (PCU)s create current paths between the station and the ambient plasma field.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT1998/5000/5430patterson.html |title=Cathodes Delivered for Space Station Plasma Contactor System |series=Research & Technology |publisher=NASA\Lewis Research Center |first=Michael J. |last=Patterson |date=1998 |id=TM-1999-208815 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705185854/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT1998/ |archivedate=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes</ref>

File:EATCS.png|thumb|ISS External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) diagram
The station's systems and experiments consume a large amount of electrical power, almost all of which converts to heat. Little of this heat dissipates through the walls of the station. To keep the internal ambient temperature within comfortable, workable limits, ammonia is continuously pumped through pipes throughout the station to collect heat, then into external radiators to emit infrared radiation, then back into the station.<ref>cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016</ref> Thus this passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes.

If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop that can withstand the much lower temperature of space, and is circulated through radiators to remove the heat. The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kibō'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70&nbsp;kW. This is much more than the 14&nbsp;kW of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched on STS-105 and installed onto the P6 Truss.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/473486main_iss_atcs_overview.pdf ATCS Team Overview].

Orbital boost burns would generally be delayed until after the shuttle's departure. This allowed shuttle payloads to be lifted with the station's engines during the routine firings, rather than have the shuttle lift itself and the payload together to a higher orbit. This trade-off allowed heavier loads to be transferred to the station. After the retirement of the NASA shuttle, the nominal orbit of the space station was raised in altitude.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/06/europes-atv-2-depart-iss-make-way-russias-progress-m-11m/ |title=Europe's ATV-2 departs ISS to make way for Russia's Progress M-11M |publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=1 May 2012</ref><ref name="Popular Mechanics">cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/4275571.html |title=The Uncertain Future of the International Space Station: Analysis |author=Rand Simberg |date=29 July 2008 |accessdate=6 March 2009 |publisher=Popular Mechanics |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331140838/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/4275571.html |archivedate=31 March 2009</ref> Other, more frequent supply ships do not require this adjustment as they are substantially lighter vehicles.<ref name="Worldbook at NASA">cite web |url=http://www.worldbookonline.com/pl/referencecenter/article?id=ar279523 |title=International Space Station |work=World Book Online Reference Center |first=James |last=Oberg |date=2005 |accessdate=3 April 2016</ref><ref name="nasa.gov-iss-environment">cite web |url=http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/D-aboutiss/D6.html |title=ISS Environment |publisher=Johnson Space Center |accessdate=15 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213164432/http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/D-aboutiss/D6.html |archivedate=13 February 2008</ref>

The Russian Orbital Segment contains the Data Management System, which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control (ROS GNC) for the entire station.<ref name="Navigation">cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/export/esaHS/ESAOXX0VMOC_iss_0.html |title=DMS-R: ESA's Data Management System for the Russian Segment of the ISS</ref> Initially, ''Zarya'', the first module of the station, controlled the station until a short time after the Russian service module ''Zvezda'' docked and was transferred control.

The FTCs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced fault-masking by majority voting.

Orientation
''Zvezda'' uses gyroscopes (reaction wheels) and thrusters to turn itself around. Gyroscopes do not require propellant, rather they use electricity to 'store' momentum in flywheels by turning in the opposite direction to the station's movement. The USOS has its own computer controlled gyroscopes to handle the extra mass of that section. When gyroscopes Control moment gyroscope#Saturation|'saturate', thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum. During Expedition 10, an incorrect command was sent to the station's computer, using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed. When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which has no thrusters.<ref>cite web |url=http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight_pg1.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=1 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720193844/http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2012 |dead-url=yes </ref><ref>cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2005/iss05-7.html |title=International Space Station Status Report #05-7 |date=11 February 2005 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=23 November 2008</ref><ref>cite book |title=Dynamics and Control of Attitude, Power, and Momentum for a Spacecraft Using Flywheels and Control Moment Gyroscopes |author=Carlos Roithmayr |format=PDF |year=2003 |publisher=NASA |location=Langley Research Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030038806_2003038772.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2011</ref> When an ATV, NASA Shuttle, or Soyuz is docked to the station, it can also be used to maintain station attitude such as for troubleshooting.

Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) are spare parts that can be readily replaced when a unit either passes its design life or fails. Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Many are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called ExPRESS Logistics Carriers (ELCs) or share larger platforms called External Stowage Platforms which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets have electricity as many parts which could be damaged by the cold of space require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have computer local area network connections (LAN) and telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus and SpaceX Dragon|Dragon, carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.

Unexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons, had these problems not been resolved. During STS-120 in 2007, following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays, it was noted during the redeployment of the array that it had become torn and was not deploying properly.<ref name="Astronauts notice tear in solar panel">cite news |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1123767/astronauts_notice_tear_in_solar_panel/index.html |title=Astronauts notice tear in solar panel |accessdate=30 October 2007 |agency=Associated Press |date=30 October 2007 |first=Liz Austin |last=Peterson</ref> An EVA was carried out by Scott E. Parazynski|Scott Parazynski, assisted by Douglas H. Wheelock|Douglas Wheelock. The men took extra precautions to reduce the risk of electric shock, as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight.<ref name="Space Station's Damaged Panel Is Fixed">cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/03/AR2007110300227.html |title=Space Station's Damaged Panel Is Fixed |accessdate=4 November 2007 |work=The Washington Post |date=4 November 2007 |first=Rob |last=Stein</ref> The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station. Excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 and STS-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint, and so the joint was locked to prevent further damage.<ref name="joint-update">cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts123/080325sarj/index.html |title=Station chief gives detailed update on joint problem |accessdate=5 November 2008 |first=William |last=Harwood |publisher=CBS News & SpaceflightNow.com |date=25 March 2008</ref><ref>cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100003841.pdf |title=The International Space Station Solar Alpha Rotary Joint Anomaly Investigation |conference=40th Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium. 12–14 May 2010.

2009 saw damage to the S1 radiator, one of the components of the station's cooling system. The problem was first noticed in Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz imagery in September 2008, but was not thought to be serious.<ref name="Radiator">cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/04/iss-concern-s1-radiator-may-require-replacement-shuttle-mission/ |first=Chris |last=Bergin |date=1 April 2009 |publisher=NASASpaceflight.com |title=ISS concern over S1 Radiator&nbsp;– may require replacement via shuttle mission |accessdate=3 April 2009</ref> The imagery showed that the surface of one sub-panel has peeled back from the underlying central structure, possibly because of micro-meteoroid or debris impact. It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover, jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, had struck the S1 radiator, but its effect, if any, has not been determined. On 15 May 2009 the damaged radiator panel's ammonia tubing was mechanically shut off from the rest of the cooling system by the computer-controlled closure of a valve. The same valve was used immediately afterwards to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak from the cooling system via the damaged panel.<ref name="Radiator" />

Early on 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.<ref>cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/31station/ |title=Problem forces partial powerdown aboard station |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=34622 |title=NASA ISS On-Orbit Status 1 August 2010 (early edition) |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/atcs.html |title=ISS Active Control System |publisher=Boeing |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=16 November 2010</ref> The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid. Several subsystems, including two of the four CMGs, were shut down.

Planned operations on the ISS were interrupted through a series of EVAs to address the cooling system issue. A first EVA on 7 August 2010, to replace the failed pump module, was not fully completed because of an ammonia leak in one of four quick-disconnects. A second EVA on 11 August successfully removed the failed pump module.<ref>cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/station/exp24/100810evapre/ |title=Wednesday spacewalk to remove failed coolant pump |work=Spaceflight Now |first=William |last=Harwood |date=10 August 2010</ref><ref>cite news |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/08/live-second-eva-with-pump-module-changeout/ |title=Large success for second EVA as failed Pump Module is removed |work=NASA Spaceflight |first=Chris |last=Gebhardt |date=11 August 2010</ref> A third EVA was required to restore Loop A to normal functionality.<ref>cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/station/exp24/100811eva2/index5.html |title=Station's bad pump removed; more spacewalking ahead |work=Spaceflight Now |first=William |last=Harwood |date=11 August 2010</ref><ref>cite news |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/08/iss-cooling-returning-normal-confirming-etcs-pm-success/ |title=ISS cooling configuration returning to normal confirming ETCS PM success |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Chris |last=Bergin |date=18 August 2010</ref>

The four Main Bus Switching Units (MBSUs, located in the S0 truss), control the routing of power from the four solar array wings to the rest of the ISS. In late 2011 MBSU-1, while still routing power correctly, ceased responding to commands or sending data confirming its health, and was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available EVA. In each MBSU, two power channels feed 160V DC from the arrays to two DC-to-DC power converters (DDCUs) that supply the 124V power used in the station. A spare MBSU was already on board, but 30 August 2012 EVA failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before electrical connection was secured.<ref>cite news |first=Pete |last=Harding |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/08/astronaut-perform-first-post-shuttle-spacewalk-iss |title=Astronaut duo complete challenging first post-Shuttle US spacewalk on ISS |work=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=22 October 2013</ref> The loss of MBSU-1 limits the station to 75% of its normal power capacity, requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem can be addressed.

On 5 September 2012, in a second, 6&nbsp;hr, EVA to replace MBSU-1, astronauts Sunita Williams and Akihiko Hoshide successfully restored the ISS to 100% power.<ref>cite news |url=http://spaceref.com/international-space-station/critical-space-station-spacewalk-a-success.html |title=Critical Space Station spacewalk a Success |work=SpaceRef |first=Marc |last=Boucher |date=5 September 2012</ref>

On 24 December 2013, astronauts made a rare Christmas Eve space walk, installing a new ammonia pump for the station's cooling system. The faulty cooling system had failed earlier in the month, halting many of the station's science experiments. Astronauts had to brave a "mini blizzard" of ammonia while installing the new pump. It was only the second Christmas Eve spacewalk in NASA history.<ref>cite news |url=http://www.leaker.com/astronauts-complete-rare-christmas-eve-spacewalk/ |title=Astronauts Complete Rare Christmas Eve Spacewalk |work=Leaker |agency=Associated Press |date=24 December 2013 |accessdate=24 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226025635/http://www.leaker.com/astronauts-complete-rare-christmas-eve-spacewalk/ |archivedate=26 December 2013</ref>

All Russian spacecraft and self-propelled modules are able to rendezvous and dock to the space station without human intervention using the Kurs (docking system)|Kurs docking system. Radar allows these vehicles to detect and intercept ISS from over 200 kilometres away. The European ATV uses star sensors and GPS to determine its intercept course. When it catches up it uses laser equipment to Computer vision|optically recognise ''Zvezda'', along with the Kurs system for redundancy. <!--At 4.5&nbsp;km the atv switches from AGPS to RGPS -p--> Crew supervise these craft, but do not intervene except to send abort commands in emergencies. The Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle parks itself in progressively closer orbits to the station, and then awaits 'approach' commands from the crew, until it is close enough for a robotic arm to grapple and berth the vehicle to the USOS. The American Space Shuttle was manually docked, and on missions with a Multi-Purpose Logistics Module|cargo container, the container would be berthed to the Station with the use of manual robotic arms. Berthed craft can transfer International Standard Payload Racks. Japanese spacecraft berth for one to two months.

The American manual approach to docking allows greater initial flexibility and less complexity. The downside to this mode of operation is that each mission becomes unique and requires specialised training and planning, making the process more labour-intensive and expensive. The Russians pursued an automated methodology that used the crew in override or monitoring roles. Although the initial development costs were high, the system has become very reliable with standardisations that provide significant cost benefits in repetitive routine operations.<ref>cite journal |title=Navigating the Road to Autonomous Orbital Rendezvous |journal=Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets |first1=David C. |last1=Woffinden |first2=David K. |last2=Geller |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=898–909 |date=July 2007 |doi=10.2514/1.30734 |bibcode=2007JSpRo..44..898W</ref> An automated approach could allow assembly of modules orbiting other worlds prior to crew arrival.

= Launch and docking windows =
Prior to a ship's docking to the ISS, navigation and attitude control (GNC) is handed over to the ground control of the ships' country of origin. GNC is set to allow the station to drift in space, rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes. The solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming ships, so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells. When a NASA Space Shuttle docked to the station, other ships were grounded, as the Shuttle's reinforced carbon-carbon wing leading edges, cameras, windows, and instruments were too much at risk from damage or contamination by thruster residue from other ships' movements.

Approximately 30% of NASA shuttle launch delays were caused by poor weather. Occasional priority was given to the Soyuz arrivals at the station where the Soyuz carried crew with time-critical cargoes such as biological experiment materials, also causing shuttle delays. Departure of the NASA shuttle was often delayed or prioritised according to weather over its two landing sites.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/may/HQ_09-118_Shuttle_Landing_Delayed.html |title=NASA's Space Shuttle Landing Delayed by Weather |publisher=NASA |first1=Katherine |last1=Trinidad |first2=Candrea |last2=Thomas |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2015</ref> Whilst the Soyuz is capable of landing anywhere, anytime, its planned landing time and place is chosen to give consideration to helicopter pilots and ground recovery crew, to give acceptable flying weather and lighting conditions. Soyuz launches occur in adverse weather conditions, but the cosmodrome has been shut down on occasions when buried by snow drifts up to 6 metres in depth, hampering ground operations.

A typical day for the crew begins with a wake-up at 06:00, followed by post-sleep activities and a morning inspection of the station. The crew then eats breakfast and takes part in a daily planning conference with Mission Control before starting work at around 08:10. The first scheduled exercise of the day follows, after which the crew continues work until 13:05. Following a one-hour lunch break, the afternoon consists of more exercise and work before the crew carries out its pre-sleep activities beginning at 19:30, including dinner and a crew conference. The scheduled sleep period begins at 21:30. In general, the crew works ten hours per day on a weekday, and five hours on Saturdays, with the rest of the time their own for relaxation or work catch-up.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/287386main_110508_tl.pdf |title=ISS Crew Timeline |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=5 November 2008 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF</ref>

The time zone used aboard the ISS is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The windows are covered at night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets per day. During visiting Space Shuttle missions, the ISS crew mostly follows the shuttle's Mission Elapsed Time (MET), which is a flexible time zone based on the launch time of the shuttle mission.<ref>cite web |title=NASA – Time in Space, A Space in Time |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/time_in_space.html |website=www.nasa.gov |accessdate=5 May 2015</ref><ref>cite web |title=A Slice of Time Pie |url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/blog/ISS%20Science%20Blog/posts/post_1340820317951.html |date=17 March 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317075600/http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/blog/ISS%20Science%20Blog/posts/post_1340820317951.html |archivedate=17 March 2013</ref><ref>cite web |title=Human Space Flight (HSF) – Crew Answers |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/feedback/expert/answer/crew/sts-113/index_2.html |website=spaceflight.nasa.gov |accessdate=5 May 2015</ref>

The station provides crew quarters for each member of the expedition's crew, with two 'sleep stations' in the ''Zvezda'' and four more installed in ''Harmony''.<ref>cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dG9vSyUFQ |title=At Home with Commander Scott Kelly (Video) |date=6 December 2010 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=8 May 2011 |location=International Space Station</ref><ref>cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080013462_2008012884.pdf |title=International Space Station USOS Crew Quarters Development |first1=James Lee |last1=Broyan |first2=Melissa Ann |last2=Borrego |first3=Juergen F. |last3=Bahr |year=2008 |publisher=SAE International |accessdate=8 May 2011</ref> The American quarters are private, approximately person-sized soundproof booths. The Russian crew quarters include a small window, but provide less ventilation and sound proofing. A crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag, listen to music, use a laptop, and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls. The module also provides a reading lamp, a shelf and a desktop.<ref name="ESALife">cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAH1V0VMOC_astronauts_0.html |publisher=ESA |accessdate=28 October 2009 |date=19 July 2004 |title=Daily life</ref><ref name="NASACrewEquip">cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/126_payload.html |title=Station Prepares for Expanding Crew |publisher=NASA |first=Cheryl L. |last=Mansfield |date=7 November 2008 |accessdate=17 September 2009</ref><ref name="CSALife">cite web |url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/pdf/educator-liv_wor_iss.pdf |title=Living and Working on the International Space Station |accessdate=28 October 2009 |publisher=CSA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419045323/http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/pdf/educator-liv_wor_iss.pdf |archivedate=19 April 2009</ref> Visiting crews have no allocated sleep module, and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall.

Most of the food aboard is vacuum sealed in plastic bags. Cans are rare because they are heavy and expensive to transport. Preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew, and taste is reduced in microgravity.<ref name="ESALife" /> Therefore, effort is made to make the food more palatable, such as using more spices than in regular cooking. The crew looks forward to the arrival of any ships from Earth, as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables. Care is taken that foods do not create crumbs. Sauces are often used to avoid contaminating station equipment. Each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them using the on-board galley. The galley features two food warmers, a refrigerator added in November 2008, and a water dispenser that provides both heated and unheated water.<ref name="NASACrewEquip" /> Drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption.<ref name="NASACrewEquip" /><ref name="CSALife" /> Drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws. Solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away. Any food that floats away, including crumbs, must be collected to prevent it from clogging the station's air filters and other equipment.<ref name="CSALife" />

In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of Expedition 10 took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the Russian Orbital Segment|ROS designed for this purpose.<ref>cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html</ref><ref>cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/</ref>

Subatomic charged particles, primarily protons from cosmic rays and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 millisievert each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth. This results in a higher risk of cancer for astronauts. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the DNA and chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system, and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower immunity (medical)|immunity experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name="JCB"/>

Radiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew. Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010</ref>

There is considerable evidence that psychosocial stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E. Wilk |author3=Lindi Cassel |title=Flying with Strangers: Postmission Reflections of Multinational Space Crews</ref> Cosmonaut Valery Ryumin wrote in his journal during a particularly difficult period on board the Salyut 6|''Salyut'' 6 space station: "All the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 and leave them together for two months."

NASA's interest in Stress (psychological)|psychological stress caused by space travel, initially studied when their manned missions began, was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the Russian space station ''Mir''. Common sources of stress in early American missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut Daniel M. Tani|Daniel Tani died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.

A study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>Cite journal |last1=Manzey |first1=D. |last2=Lorenz |first2=B. |last3=Poljakov |first3=V. |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: Results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537–559 |year=1998 |pmid=9557591 |pmc=</ref> ''Skylab'''s three crews remained one, two, and three months, respectively; long-term crews on ''Salyut''&nbsp;6, Salyut 7|''Salyut''&nbsp;7, and the ISS last about five to six months, and ''Mir'''s expeditions often lasted longer.

The ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language. First-generation space stations had crews who spoke a single language; second- and third-generation stations have crew from many cultures who speak many languages. Astronauts must speak English language|English and Russian language|Russian, and knowing additional languages is even better.<ref>cite web |url=https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/support/training/isstraining/index.html |title=Behind the Scenes: The Making of an Astronaut |publisher=NASA |date=23 August 2004</ref>

The ISS is unique because visitors are not classed automatically into 'host' or 'guest' categories as with previous stations and spacecraft, and may not suffer from feelings of isolation in the same way. Crew members with a military pilot background and those with an academic science background or teachers and politicians may have problems understanding each other's jargon and worldview.

Due to the lack of gravity, confusion often occurs. Even though there is no up and down in space, some crew members feel like they are oriented upside down. They may also have difficulty measuring distances. This can cause problems like getting lost inside the space station, pulling switches in the wrong direction or misjudging the speed of an approaching vehicle during docking.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141007-why-astronauts-get-space-stupid BBC - Future - Why astronauts get the 'space stupids']</ref>

Medical effects of long-term weightlessness include muscle atrophy, deterioration of the skeleton spaceflight osteopenia|(osteopenia), fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, and puffiness of the face.<ref name="JCB" />

Sleep is disturbed on the ISS regularly because of mission demands, such as incoming or departing ships. Sound levels in the station are unavoidably high; because the atmosphere is unable to thermosiphon, fans are required at all times to allow processing of the atmosphere which would stagnate in the freefall (zero-g) environment.

To prevent some of these adverse physiological effects, the station is equipped with two treadmills (including the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation System|COLBERT), and the aRED (advanced Resistive Exercise Device) which enables various weightlifting exercises which add muscle but do not compensate for or raise astronauts' reduced bone density,<ref>Cite journal |last1=Schneider |first1=S.

Ballistic panels, also called micrometeorite shielding, are incorporated into the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems. The type and thickness of these panels depend on their predicted exposure to damage. The station's shields and structure have different designs on the ROS and the USOS. On the USOS, Whipple Shield|Whipple shields are used, consisting generally of a thin aluminium sheet held apart from the hull, optionally with intermediate layers of Kevlar and Nextel, which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact. On the ROS, a carbon plastic honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull, an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that, with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering, and glass cloth over the top.

Regarding extending the ISS, on 15 November 2016 General Director Vladimir Solntsev of RSC Energia stated "Maybe the ISS will receive continued resources. Today we discussed the possibility of using the station until 2028," and "Much will depend on the political moments in relations with the Americans, with the new administration. It will be discussed."<ref name="sputnik20161115">cite news |url=https://sputniknews.com/russia/201611151047447591-russia-iss-rsc-lifespan/ |title=ISS' Life Span Could Extend Into 2028 – Space Corporation Energia Director |work=Sputnik |date=15 November 2016 |accessdate=18 November 2016</ref><ref name="sputnik20161116">cite news |url=https://sputniknews.com/science/201611161047493600-russia-orbital-station/ |title=Space Cowboys: Moscow to Mull Building Russian Orbital Station in Spring 2017 |work=Sputnik |date=16 November 2016 |accessdate=18 November 2016</ref> There have also been suggestions that the station could be converted to commercial operations after it is retired by government entities.<ref name="trump-budget-request">Cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930154/nasa-international-space-station-president-trump-budget-request-2025 |title=Trump administration wants to end NASA funding for the International Space Station by 2025 |work=The Verge |last=Grush |first=Loren |date=24 January 2018 |access-date=24 April 2018</ref> In September 2018, United States House of Representatives|U.S. House member Brian Babin introduced legislation intended to extend operations of the ISS to 2030;<ref>cite news |url=https://www.spacenews.com/house-joins-senate-in-push-to-extend-iss/ |title=House joins Senate in push to extend ISS |website=SpaceNews |last=Foust |first=Jeff |date=27 September 2018 |accessdate=2 October 2018</ref> which was approved on 20 December.<ref name=nelson-20181020 />

Cost
The ISS has been described as the most expensive single item ever constructed.<ref>cite web |author=Zidbits |url=http://zidbits.com/?p=19 |title=What Is The Most Expensive Object Ever Built? |publisher=Zidbits.com |date=6 November 2010 |accessdate=22 October 2013</ref> In 2010 the cost was expected to be $150&nbsp;billion. This includes NASA's budget of $58.7&nbsp;billion (inflation-unadjusted) for the station from 1985 to 2015 ($72.4&nbsp;billion in 2010 dollars), Russia's $12&nbsp;billion, Europe's $5&nbsp;billion, Japan's $5&nbsp;billion, Canada's $2&nbsp;billion, and the cost of 36 shuttle flights to build the station; estimated at $1.4&nbsp;billion each, or $50.4&nbsp;billion in total. Assuming 20,000 person-days of use from 2000 to 2015 by two- to six-person crews, each person-day would cost $7.5&nbsp;million, less than half the inflation-adjusted $19.6&nbsp;million ($5.5&nbsp;million before inflation) per person-day of ''Skylab''.<ref name="lafleur20100308">cite news |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1579/1 |title=Costs of US piloted programs |work=The Space Review |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=18 February 2012 |author=Lafleur, Claude See author correction in comments.</ref>

File:International_Space_Station_orbit-August_2_2018.png|400px|thumb|Simulated motion of the ISS over North America, with 12 second motion markers and vertical lines projecting down to the surface of the Earth. The ISS is shown red when it enters the earth's shadow and can't be seen. It is only easily visible in the twilight interval of night just after sunset, or before sunrise.
The ISS is visible to the naked eye as a slow-moving, bright white dot because of reflected sunlight, and can be seen in the hours after sunset and before sunrise, when the station remains sunlit but the ground and sky are dark.<ref name="Price2005">cite book |title=The Backyard Stargazer: An Absolute Beginner's Guide to Skywatching With and Without a Telescope |publisher=Quarry Books |location=Gloucester, MA |first=Pat |last=Price |page=140 |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-59253-148-6</ref> The ISS takes about 10 minutes to pass from one horizon to another, and will only be visible part of that time because of moving into or out of the Earth's shadow. Because of the size of its reflective surface area, the ISS is the brightest artificial object in the sky, excluding satellite flare|flares, with an approximate maximum apparent magnitude|magnitude of −4 when overhead (similar to Venus). The ISS, like many satellites including the Iridium constellation, can also produce flares of up to 8 or 16 times the brightness of Venus (planet)|Venus as sunlight glints off reflective surfaces.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/8 |title=Artificial Satellites > (Iridium) Flares |publisher=Calsky.com |accessdate=1 May 2012</ref><ref name="haydenplanetarium">cite web |url=http://www.amnh.org/our-research/hayden-planetarium/blog/how-to-spot-the-international-space-station-and-other-satellites |title=How to Spot the International Space Station (and other satellites) |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=12 July 2011</ref> The ISS is also visible in broad daylight, albeit with a great deal more difficulty.

Tools are provided by a number of websites such as Heavens-Above (see #Live viewing|''Live viewing'' below) as well as smartphone applications that use ephemeris|orbital data and the observer's longitude and latitude to indicate when the ISS will be visible (weather permitting), where the station will appear to rise, the altitude above the horizon it will reach and the duration of the pass before the station disappears either by setting below the horizon or entering into Earth's shadow.<ref name="see">cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/index.html |title=International Space Station Sighting Opportunities |accessdate=28 January 2009 |publisher=NASA |date=2 July 2008 |author=NASA</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www.heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?satid=25544&lat=0&lng=0&loc=Unspecified&alt=0&tz=CET |title=ISS&nbsp;– Information |publisher=Heavens-Above.com |accessdate=8 July 2010</ref><ref>cite journal |author=Harold F.

In November 2012 NASA launched its "Spot the Station" service, which sends people text and email alerts when the station is due to fly above their town.<ref>cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Get-notified-when-the-International-Space-Station-is-in-your-area/tabid/1160/articleID/275612/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title=Get notified when the International Space Station is in your area |date=6 November 2012 |access-date=21 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012231134/http://www.3news.co.nz/Get-notified-when-the-International-Space-Station-is-in-your-area/tabid/1160/articleID/275612/Default.aspx |archive-date=12 October 2013 |dead-url=yes </ref> The station is visible from 95% of the inhabited land on Earth, but is not visible from extreme northern or southern latitudes.<ref name="MCC Answer" />

Some amateur astronomers also use telescopic lenses to photograph the ISS while it Transit (astronomy)|transits the sun, sometimes doing so during an Solar eclipse|eclipse (and so the Sun, Moon, and ISS are all positioned approximately in a single line). One example is during the Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017|21 August solar eclipse, where at one location in Wyoming, images of the ISS were captured during the eclipse.<ref>cite web |title=Space Station Transiting 2017 ECLIPSE, My Brain Stopped Working - Smarter Every Day 175 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lepQoU4oek4 |website=www.youtube.com |date=22 August 2017</ref> Similar images were captured by NASA from a location in Washington.

Parisian engineer and astrophotographer Thierry Legault, known for his photos of spaceships transiting the Sun, travelled to Oman in 2011 to photograph the Sun, Moon and space station all lined up.<ref>cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2011/01/double-eclipse/ |work=Wired |first=Lisa |last=Grossman |title=Moon and Space Station Eclipse the Sun</ref> Legault, who received the Marius Jacquemetton award from the Société astronomique de France in 1999, and other hobbyists, use websites that predict when the ISS will transit the Sun or Moon and from what location those passes will be visible.
