File:CelsiusKelvin.svg|thumb|right|150px|Zero kelvin (−273.15&nbsp;°C) is defined as absolute zero.

Absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value, taken as 0. The fundamental particles of nature have minimum vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical, zero-point energy-induced particle motion.  The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law; by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as −273.15° on the Celsius scale (International System of Units),<ref name=sib2115>cite web|title=Unit of thermodynamic temperature (kelvin) |work=SI Brochure, 8th edition |at=Section 2.1.1.5 |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/kelvin.html |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |date=13 March 2010 |origyear=1967 |access-date=20 June 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007053944/http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/kelvin.html |archivedate=7 October 2014  Note: The triple point of water is 0.01 °C, not 0 °C; thus 0 K is −273.15 °C, not −273.16 °C.</ref><ref name="arora">cite book|title=Thermodynamics|first1=C.

It is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible, but it is not the lowest ''enthalpy'' state possible, because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid, and then to solid; and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization (gas to liquid) and enthalpy of fusion (liquid to solid) exceeds the ideal gas's change in enthalpy to absolute zero. In the quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical description, matter (solid) at absolute zero is in its ground state, the point of lowest internal energy.

The laws of thermodynamics indicate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means, because the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically,<ref> Citation | last = Masanes | first = Lluís | last2 = Oppenheim | first2 = Jonathan | author2-link = Jonathan Oppenheim  | date = 14 March 2017 | title = A general derivation and quantification of the third law of thermodynamics | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | pages = 14538 | number = 14538 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms14538 | pmid = 28290452 | url = http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14538 </ref> and a system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical zero-point energy, the energy of its ground state at absolute zero. The kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed. 
 
Scientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits Bose–Einstein condensate|quantum effects such as superconductivity and superfluidity.

Thermodynamics near absolute zero
At temperatures near convert|0|K|C F, nearly all molecular motion ceases and Δ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for any adiabatic process, where ''S'' is the entropy.  In such a circumstance, pure substances can (ideally) form perfect crystals as ''T'' → 0. Max Planck's strong form of the third law of thermodynamics states the entropy of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero. The original Walther Nernst|Nernst ''Nernst heat theorem|heat theorem'' makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any isothermal process approaches zero as ''T'' → 0:
:<math> \lim_{T \to 0} \Delta S = 0 </math>

The implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal simply approaches a constant value.

<blockquote>The Third Law of Thermodynamics|Nernst postulate identifies the isothermal process|isotherm T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 as coincident with the adiabat S&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can Line-line intersection|intersect the T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature. (≈&nbsp;Callen, pp.&nbsp;189–190)</blockquote>

A perfect crystal is one in which the internal lattice (group)|lattice structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational symmetry along three (not usually orthogonality|orthogonal) Cartesian coordinate system|axes. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For chemical substance|substances that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and graphite for carbon, there is a kind of ''chemical degeneracy''. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 even though each is perfectly ordered.

Perfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous material inclusions, can and do simply get "frozen in" at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.

Using the Debye model, the specific heat capacity|specific heat and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, while the enthalpy and chemical potential are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;4</sup>. (Guggenheim, p.&nbsp;111) These quantities drop toward their ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 limiting values and approach with ''zero'' slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10&nbsp;K. Even the less detailed Einstein solid|Einstein model shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of thermal expansion. Maxwell relations|Maxwell's relations show that various other quantities also vanish. These phenomenon|phenomena were unanticipated.

Since the relation between changes in Gibbs free energy (''G''), the enthalpy (''H'') and the entropy is

:<math> \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S \,</math>

thus, as ''T'' decreases, Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' approach each other (so long as Δ''S'' is bounded). Experimentally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including chemical reactions) result in a decrease in ''G'' as they proceed toward thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium. If Δ''S'' and/or ''T'' are small, the condition Δ''G''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0 may imply that Δ''H''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0, which would indicate an exothermic reaction. However, this is not required; endothermic reactions can proceed spontaneously if the ''T''Δ''S'' term is large enough.

Moreover, the slopes of the derivatives of Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' converge and are equal to zero at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. This ensures that Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate empiricism|empirical Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that ''the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one that evolves the greatest amount of heat'', i.e., an actual process is the ''most exothermic one''. (Callen, pp.&nbsp;186–187)

One model that estimates the properties of an electron gas at absolute zero in metals is the Fermi gas. The electrons, being Fermions, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical velocities, even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is of the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical equipartition theorem for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.

Relation with Bose–Einstein condensate
Main|Bose–Einstein condensate

A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter of a dilute gas of weakly interacting bosons confined in an external potential and cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero. Under such conditions, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest quantum state of the external potential, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a macroscopic scale.<ref>cite journal|journal=Nature|volume=412|pages=295–299|year=2001|title=Dynamics of collapsing and exploding Bose–Einstein condensates|pmid=11460153|issue=6844|doi=10.1038/35085500|arxiv = cond-mat/0105019 |bibcode = 2001Natur.412..295D|last1=Donley|first1=Elizabeth A.|last2=Claussen|first2=Neil R.|last3=Cornish|first3=Simon L.|last4=Roberts|first4=Jacob L.|last5=Cornell|first5=Eric A.|last6=Wieman|first6=Carl E.</ref>

This state of matter was first predicted by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 1924–25. Bose first sent a paper to Einstein on the quantum statistics of light quanta (now called photons). Einstein was impressed, translated the paper from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the ''Zeitschrift für Physik'', which published it. Einstein then extended Bose's ideas to material particles (or matter) in two other papers.<ref>Clark, Ronald W. "Einstein: The Life and Times" (Avon Books, 1971) pp. 408–9 ISBN|0-380-01159-X</ref>

Seventy years later, in 1995, the first gaseous Bose–Einstein condensate|condensate was produced by Eric Allin Cornell|Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado at Boulder National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST-JILA lab, using a gas of rubidium atoms cooled to 170&nbsp;kelvin|nanokelvins (nK)<ref>cite web|title=New State of Matter Seen Near Absolute Zero |url=http://physics.nist.gov/News/Update/950724.html |publisher=NIST |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601175245/http://physics.nist.gov/News/Update/950724.html |archivedate=1 June 2010 |df=dmy </ref> (val|1.7|e=-7|u=K).<ref>cite web|last = Levi|first = Barbara Goss|title = Cornell, Ketterle, and Wieman Share Nobel Prize for Bose–Einstein Condensates|work = Search & Discovery|publisher = Physics Today online| year = 2001|url = http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-12/p14.html|accessdate =2008-01-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024134547/http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-12/p14.html |archivedate =2007-10-24</ref>

Absolute temperature scales
Absolute, or thermodynamic temperature|thermodynamic, temperature is conventionally measured in kelvins (Celsius-scaled increments) and in the Rankine scale (Fahrenheit-scaled increments) with increasing rarity. Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the ''degree'', so the ''ratios'' of two absolute temperatures, ''T''<sub>2</sub>/''T''<sub>1</sub>, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. It can also be found in Fermi–Dirac statistics (for particles of half-integer spin (physics)|spin) and Bose–Einstein statistics (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing exponential functions of energy (at the particle level) over ''kT'', with ''k'' representing the Boltzmann constant and ''T'' representing the temperature observed at the macroscopic level.<ref name="sib2115"/>

Negative temperatures
Main|Negative temperature

Temperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain system (thermodynamics)|systems can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their thermodynamic temperature (expressed in kelvins) can be of a Negative number|negative quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than ''any'' system with a positive temperature, in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.<ref name="Chase">cite web|last=Chase|first=Scott|title=Below Absolute Zero -What Does Negative Temperature Mean?|url=http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|work=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=2010-07-02</ref>

Most familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their entropy. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added.<ref name="Chase"/> As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state,citation needed|date=October 2016 so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.

On 3 January 2013, physicists announced that they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom for the first time.<ref>cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.12146|title=Quantum gas goes below absolute zero|journal=Nature|year=2013|last1=Merali|first1=Zeeya</ref>

History
File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Robert Boyle pioneered the idea of an absolute zero.
One of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was Robert Boyle. His 1665 ''New Experiments and Observations touching Cold'', articulated the dispute known as the ''primum frigidum''.<ref>cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vRaAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA651|title=The Stanford Dictionary of Anglicised Words and Phrases|authorlink=John Frederick Stanford|last=Stanford|first=John Frederick|year=1892 </ref> The concept was well known among naturalists of the time. Some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth (as one of the four classical elements), others within water, others air, and some more recently within niter|nitre. But all of them seemed to agree that, "There is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality."<ref>cite book|last=Boyle|first=Robert|title=New Experiments and Observations touching Cold|year=1665</ref>

=Limit to the "degree of cold"=
The question whether there is a limit to the degree of coldness possible, and, if so, where the zero must be placed, was first addressed by the French physicist Guillaume Amontons in 1702, in connection with his improvements in the gas thermometer|air-thermometer. His instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury—the volume, or "spring" of the air varying with temperature. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing. He used a scale that marked the boiling-point of water at +73 and the melting-point of ice at +frac|51|1|2, so that the zero was equivalent to about −240 on the Celsius scale.<ref name=AS2016>Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cold</ref>

This close approximation to the modern value of −273.15&nbsp;°C<ref name="sib2115"/> for the zero of the air-thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by Johann Heinrich Lambert, who observed that convert|-270|C|F K might be regarded as absolute cold.<ref>cite book|last=Lambert|first=Johann Heinrich|title=Pyrometrie|location=Berlin|year=1779|oclc=165756016</ref>

Values of this order for the absolute zero were not, however, universally accepted about this period. Pierre-Simon Laplace and Antoine Lavoisier, in their 1780 treatise on heat, arrived at values ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 below the freezing-point of water, and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below. John Dalton in his ''Chemical Philosophy'' gave ten calculations of this value, and finally adopted −3000&nbsp;°C as the natural zero of temperature.

=Lord Kelvin's work=
After James Prescott Joule had determined the mechanical equivalent of heat, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin approached the question from an entirely different point of view, and in 1848 devised a scale of absolute temperature that was independent of the properties of any particular substance and was based on Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot's theory of the Motive Power of Heat and data published by Henri Victor Regnault.<ref>cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=William|authorlink1=Lord Kelvin|title=On an Absolute Thermometric Scale founded on Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat, and calculated from Regnault's observations.|journal=Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|date=1848|volume=1|pages=66–71|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/87114#page/72/mode/2up</ref> It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at −273&nbsp;°C, at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer.<ref name="AS2016"/> This value was not immediately accepted; values ranging from convert|-271.1|C|F to  convert|-274.5|C|F, derived from laboratory measurements and observations of Atmospheric refraction#Astronomical refraction|astronomical refraction, remained in use in the early 20th century.<ref>Citation | last = Newcomb | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Newcomb | date = 1906 | title = A Compendium of Spherical Astronomy | publisher = The Macmillan Company | place = New York | page = 175 | oclc = 64423127</ref>

With a better theoretical understanding of absolute zero, scientists were eager to reach this temperature in the lab.<ref name="MyUser_YouTube_November_23_2016c">cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFRgosx4aQ&t=894s |title=ABSOLUTE ZERO - PBS NOVA DOCUMENTARY (full length) |newspaper=YouTube |date=  |author= |accessdate= November 23, 2016</ref> By 1845, Michael Faraday had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist, and reached a new record for lowest temperatures by reaching convert|-130|C|F K. Faraday believed that certain gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, were permanent gases and could not be liquefied.<ref>[http://www.scienceclarified.com/Co-Di/Cryogenics.html Cryogenics]. Scienceclarified.com. Retrieved on 2012-07-22.</ref> Decades later, in 1873 Dutch theoretical scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals demonstrated that these gases could be liquefied, but only under conditions of very high pressure and very low temperatures. In 1877, Louis Paul Cailletet in France and Raoul Pictet in Switzerland succeeded in producing the first droplets of liquid air convert|-195|C|F K. This was followed in 1883 by the production of liquid oxygen convert|-218|C|F K by the Polish professors Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.

Scottish chemist and physicist James Dewar and the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes took on the challenge to liquefy the remaining gases hydrogen and helium. In 1898, after 20 years of effort, Dewar was first to liquefy hydrogen, reaching a new low temperature record of convert|-252|C|F K. However Onnes, his rival, was the first to liquefy helium, in 1908, using several precooling stages and the Hampson–Linde cycle. He lowered the temperature to the boiling point of helium convert|-269|C|F K. By reducing the pressure of the liquid helium he achieved an even lower temperature, near 1.5 K. These were the Lowest temperature recorded on Earth|coldest temperatures achieved on earth at the time and his achievement earned him the Nobel Prize in 1913.<ref name="nobel">cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1913/onnes-bio.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1913: Heike Kamerlingh Onnes|publisher=Nobel Media AB|accessdate=24 April 2012</ref> Onnes would continue to study the properties of materials at temperatures near absolute zero, describing superconductivity and superfluids for the first time.
