Chemical rockets are the most common type of high power rocket, typically creating a high speed exhaust by the combustion of rocket propellant|fuel with an oxidizer. The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single liquid fuel that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst (monopropellants), two liquids that spontaneously react on contact (hypergolic propellants), two liquids that must be ignited to react, a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer (Solid-fuel rocket|solid fuel), or solid fuel with liquid oxidizer (Hybrid rocket|hybrid propellant system). Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.

The first gunpowder-powered rockets evolved in medieval China under the Song dynasty by the 13th century. The Mongols adopted Chinese rocket technology and the invention spread via the Mongol invasions to the Middle East and to Europe in the mid-13th century.<ref>"Rockets appear in Arab literature in 1258 A.D., describing Mongol invaders' use of them on February 15 to capture the city of Baghdad." cite web|url= http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/rocket-history.txt|title= A brief history of rocketry|work= NASA Spacelink|accessdate= 2006-08-19|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060805203537/http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/rocket-history.txt|archivedate= 2006-08-05|df= </ref> Rockets are recordedby whom|date=July 2018 in use  by the Song navy in a military exercise dated to 1245.

The name "rocket" comes from the Italian language|Italian ''rocchetta'', meaning "bobbin" or "little spindle", given due to the similarity in shape to the bobbin or spool  used to hold the  thread to be fed to a spinning wheel.
Leonhard Fronsperger and Conrad Haas adopted the Italian term into German in the mid-16th century; "rocket" appears in English by the early 17th century.<ref name="Bernhard" />
''Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima'', an important early modern work on rocket artillery, by Kazimierz Siemienowicz,  was first printed in Amsterdam in 1650.

The Mysorean rockets were the first successful iron-cased rockets, developed in the late 18th century in the Kingdom of Mysore (part of present-day India) by Tipu Sultan.<ref>Cite news|url= https://www.britannica.com/technology/rocket-and-missile-system|title= rocket and missile system ! weapons system|work= Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date= 2017-10-29|language= en|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171031034251/https://www.britannica.com/technology/rocket-and-missile-system|archivedate= 2017-10-31|df= </ref> The Congreve rocket was a United Kingdom|British weapon designed and developed by William Congreve (inventor)|Sir William Congreve in 1804. This rocket was based directly on the Mysorean rockets, used compressed powder and was fielded in the Napoleonic Wars. It was Congreve rockets that Francis Scott Key was referring to when he wrote of the "rockets' red glare" while held captive on a British ship that was laying siege to Fort McHenry in 1814.<ref>[http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/rockets-inspired-francis-scott-key-180952399/ The Rockets That Inspired Francis Scott Key]</ref> Together, the Mysorean and British innovations increased the effective range of military rockets from 100 to 2,000 yards.

The first mathematical treatment of the dynamics of rocket propulsion is due to William Moore (British mathematician)|William Moore (1813). In 1815 Alexander Dmitrievich Zasyadko constructed rocket-launching platforms, which allowed rockets to be fired in salvos (6 rockets at a time), and gun-laying devices. William Hale (British inventor)|William Hale in 1844 greatly increased the accuracy of rocket artillery. Edward Mounier Boxer further improved the Congreve rocket in 1865.

William Leitch (scientist)|William Leitch first proposed the concept of using rockets to enable human spaceflight in 1861.<ref>cite book |last1=Leitch |first1=William |title=God's Glory in the Heavens |date=1862 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuAUAQAAMAAJ |ref=harv</ref> Konstantin Tsiolkovsky later (in 1903) also conceived this idea, and extensively developed a body of theory that has provided the foundation for subsequent spaceflight development. Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard in 1920 published proposed improvements to rocket technology in ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes''.  In 1923, Hermann Oberth (1894–1989) published ''Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen'' ("The Rocket into Planetary Space")

File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goddard with a liquid oxygen-gasoline rocket (1926)

Modern rockets originated in 1926 when Goddard attached a supersonic (de Laval nozzle|de Laval) nozzle to the combustion chamber of a liquid-propellant rocket. These nozzles turn the hot gas from the combustion chamber into a cooler, hypersonic, highly directed jet of gas, more than doubling the thrust and raising the engine efficiency from 2% to 64%.
Use of liquid propellants instead of gunpowder greatly improved the effectiveness of rocket artillery in World War II, and opened up the possibility of  manned spaceflight after 1945.

In 1943 production of the V-2 rocket began in Germany.
In parallel with the German guided-missile programme,  rockets were also used on aircraft, either for assisting horizontal take-off (JATO|RATO), vertical take-off (Bachem Ba 349 "Natter") or for powering them (Me 163, see list of World War II guided missiles of Germany). The Allies' rocket programs were less technological, relying mostly on unguided missiles like the Soviet Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rocket.
The Americans captured a large number of German rocket scientists, including Wernher von Braun, in 1945, and brought them to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. After World War II scientists used rockets to study high-altitude conditions, by radio telemetry of temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, detection of cosmic rays, and further techniques; note too the Bell X-1, the first manned vehicle to break the sound barrier (1947). Independently, in the  Soviet space program|Soviet Union's space program research continued under the leadership of the chief designer Sergei Korolev (1907–1966).

During the Cold War rockets became extremely important militarily with the development of modern intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).
The 1960s saw rapid development of rocket technology, particularly in the Soviet Union (Vostok rocket|Vostok, Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz, Proton rocket|Proton) and in the United States (e.g. the X-15). Rockets came into use for space exploration. American manned programs (Project Mercury, Project Gemini and later the Apollo programme) culminated in 1969 with the first manned  moon landing|landing on the moon – using equipment launched by the Saturn V rocket.

Design
A rocket design can be as simple as a cardboard tube filled with black powder, but to make an efficient, accurate rocket or missile involves overcoming a number of difficult problems. The main difficulties include cooling the combustion chamber, pumping the fuel (in the case of a liquid fuel), and controlling and correcting the direction of motion.<ref>Citation |author= Richard B. Dow | title=Fundamentals of Advanced Missiles |year=1958 |location=Washington (DC) |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |id=loc 58-13458</ref>

=Components=
Rockets consist of a rocket propellant|propellant, a place to put propellant (such as a propellant tank), and a rocket engine nozzle|nozzle. They may also have one or more rocket engines, attitude control|directional stabilization device(s) (such as fins, vernier engines or engine gimbals for thrust vectoring, gyroscopes) and a structure (typically monocoque) to hold these components together. Rockets intended for high speed atmospheric use also have an aerodynamic fairing such as a nose cone, which usually holds the payload.<ref>Citation |author=United States Congress.

As well as these components, rockets can have any number of other components, such as wings (rocketplanes), parachutes, wheels (rocket cars), even, in a sense, a person (rocket belt). Vehicles frequently possess Automotive navigation system|navigation systems and guidance systems that typically use satellite navigation and inertial navigation systems.

=Engines=
Main|Rocket engine
File:Viking 5C rocketengine.jpg|thumb|upright|Viking 5C rocket engine
Rocket engines employ the principle of jet engine|jet propulsion.<ref name="RPE7"/> The rocket engines powering rockets come in a great variety of different types; a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines,<ref>cite web |author=Charles Lafayette Proctor II |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368065/internal-combustion-engine |title=internal combustion engines |publisher=Concise Britannica |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114004538/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368065/internal-combustion-engine |archivedate=2008-01-14 |df= </ref> but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, Solid-fuel rocket|solid propellant, liquid rocket|liquid propellant, or a hybrid rocket|hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; this is not the case in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.<ref name="RPE7"/>

=Propellant=
Main|Rocket propellant
File:Gas Core light bulb.png|thumb|Gas Core light bulb
Rocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of propellant tank or casing, prior to being used as the propulsive mass that is ejected from a rocket engine in the form of a fluid jet (fluid)|jet to produce thrust.<ref name="RPE7"/> For chemical rockets often the propellants are a fuel such as liquid hydrogen or kerosene burned with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen or nitric acid to produce large volumes of very hot gas. The oxidiser is either kept separate and mixed in the combustion chamber, or comes premixed, as with solid rockets.

Sometimes the propellant is not burned but still undergoes a chemical reaction, and can be a 'monopropellant' such as hydrazine, nitrous oxide or hydrogen peroxide that can be catalyst|catalytically decomposed to hot gas.

Alternatively, an inert propellant can be used that can be externally heated, such as in steam rocket, solar thermal rocket or nuclear thermal rockets.<ref name="RPE7"/>

For smaller, low performance rockets such as attitude control thrusters where high performance is less necessary, a pressurised fluid is used as propellant that simply escapes the spacecraft through a propelling nozzle.<ref name="RPE7"/>

Uses
Rockets or other similar reaction engine|reaction devices carrying their own propellant must be used when there is no other substance (land, water, or air) or force (gravity, magnetism, light) that a vehicle may usefully employ for propulsion, such as in space. In these circumstances, it is necessary to carry all the propellant to be used.

However, they are also useful in other situations:

Some military weapons use rockets to propel warheads to their targets. A rocket and its payload together are generally referred to as a ''missile'' when the weapon has a guidance system (not all missiles use rocket engines, some use other engines such as jet engine|jets) or as a ''rocket (weapon)|rocket'' if it is unguided. Anti-tank and Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missiles use rocket engines to engage targets at high speed at a range of several miles, while intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver multiple nuclear warheads from thousands of miles, and anti-ballistic missiles try to stop them. Rockets have also been tested for reconnaissance, such as the Ping-Pong (rocket)|Ping-Pong rocket, which was launched to surveil enemy targets, however, recon rockets have never come into wide use in the military.

Main| Spaceflight

Larger rockets are normally launched from a launch pad that provides stable support until a few seconds after ignition. Due to their high exhaust velocity—convert|2500|to|4500|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on—rockets are particularly useful when very high speeds are required, such as orbital speed at approximately convert|7800|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on. Spacecraft delivered into orbital trajectories become artificial satellites, which are used for many commercial purposes. Indeed, rockets remain the only way to launch spacecraft into orbit and beyond.<ref>cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/tracking/index.html |title=Spaceflight Now-worldwide launch schedule |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911172414/http://spaceflightnow.com/tracking/index.html |archivedate=2013-09-11 |df= </ref> They are also used to rapidly accelerate spacecraft when they change orbits or de-orbit for landing.

Rocket exhaust generates a significant amount of acoustic energy. As the supersonic exhaust collides with the ambient air, shock waves are formed.

Main|Rocket engine

The Reaction (physics)|effect of the combustion of propellant in the rocket engine is to increase the velocity of the resulting gases to very high speeds, hence producing a thrust.citation needed|date=February 2016dubious|reason=so we don't need a nozzle then?|date=February 2016 Initially, the gases of combustion are sent in every direction, but only those that produce a net thrust have any effect.citation needed|date=February 2016dubious|reason=really, send them in all directions do we?|date=February 2016 The ideal direction of motion of the exhaust is in the direction so as to cause thrust. At the top end of the combustion chamber the hot, energetic gas fluid cannot move forward, and so, it pushes upward against the top of the rocket engine's combustion chamber. As the combustion gases approach the exit of the combustion chamber, they increase in speed. The effect of the Rocket engine nozzle|convergent part of the rocket engine nozzle on the high pressure fluid of combustion gases, is to cause the gases to accelerate to high speed. The higher the speed of the gases, the lower the pressure of the gas (Bernoulli's principle or conservation of energy) acting on that part of the combustion chamber. In a properly designed engine, the flow will reach Mach 1 at the throat of the nozzle. At which point the speed of the flow increases. Beyond the throat of the nozzle, a bell shaped expansion part of the engine allows the gases that are expanding to push against that part of the rocket engine. Thus, the bell part of the nozzle gives additional thrust. Simply expressed, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to Newton's third law with the result that the exiting gases produce the reaction of a force on the rocket causing it to accelerate the rocket.<ref>cite book|last1=Warren|first1=J.

If they were to let go of the hose, it would thrash around with tremendous force. If the firefighters were all standing on skateboards, the hose would propel them backward at great speed!”|group=nb

File:Rocket thrust.svg|thumb|right|Rocket thrust is caused by pressures acting on both the combustion chamber and nozzle
In a closed chamber, the pressures are equal in each direction and no acceleration occurs. If an opening is provided in the bottom of the chamber then the pressure is no longer acting on the missing section. This opening permits the exhaust to escape. The remaining pressures give a resultant thrust on the side opposite the opening, and these pressures are what push the rocket along.

The shape of the nozzle is important. Consider a balloon propelled by air coming out of a tapering nozzle. In such a case the combination of air pressure and viscous friction is such that the nozzle does not push the balloon but is ''pulled'' by it.<ref>cite book|last1=Warren|first1=J. W.|title=Understanding force : an account of some aspects of teaching the idea of force in school, college and university courses in engineering, mathematics and science|date=1979|publisher=Murray|location=London|isbn=978-0-7195-3564-2|page=28</ref> Using a convergent/divergent nozzle gives more force since the exhaust also presses on it as it expands outwards, roughly doubling the total force. If propellant gas is continuously added to the chamber then these pressures can be maintained for as long as propellant remains. Note that in the case of liquid propellant engines, the pumps moving the propellant into the combustion chamber must maintain a pressure larger than the combustion chamber – typically on the order of 100 atmospheres.<ref name="RPE7"/>

As a side effect, these pressures on the rocket also act on the exhaust in the opposite direction and accelerate this exhaust to very high speeds (according to Newton's Third Law).<ref name="RPE7"/> From the principle of conservation of momentum the speed of the exhaust of a rocket determines how much momentum increase is created for a given amount of propellant. This is called the rocket's ''specific impulse''.<ref name="RPE7"/> Because a rocket, propellant and exhaust in flight, without any external perturbations, may be considered as a closed system, the total momentum is always constant. Therefore, the faster the net speed of the exhaust in one direction, the greater the speed of the rocket can achieve in the opposite direction. This is especially true since the rocket body's mass is typically far lower than the final total exhaust mass.

The general study of the forces on a rocket is part of the field of ballistics. Spacecraft are further studied in the subfield of astrodynamics.

* Thrust from the engine(s)
* Gravity from celestial bodies
* Drag (physics)|Drag if moving in atmosphere
* Lift (force)|Lift; usually relatively small effect except for rocket-powered aircraft

Rockets that must travel through the air are usually tall and thin as this shape gives a high ballistic coefficient and minimizes drag losses.

In addition, the centrifugal force (fictitious)|inertia and centrifugal pseudo-force can be significant due to the path of the rocket around the center of a celestial body; when high enough speeds in the right direction and altitude are achieved a stable orbit or escape velocity is obtained.

These forces, with a stabilizing tail (the ''empennage'') present will, unless deliberate control efforts are made, naturally cause the vehicle to follow a roughly parabola|parabolic trajectory termed a gravity turn, and this trajectory is often used at least during the initial part of a rocket launch|launch. (This is true even if the rocket engine is Pendulum rocket fallacy|mounted at the nose.) Vehicles can thus maintain low or even zero angle of attack, which minimizes transverse stress (physics)|stress on the launch vehicle, permitting a weaker, and hence lighter, launch vehicle.<ref name=space-sourcebook>cite book|first1=Samuel|last1=Glasstone|title=Sourcebook on the Space Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6k0AAAAMAAJ|publisher=D.

Drag
main|Drag (physics)|Gravity drag|Aerodynamic drag
Drag is a force opposite to the direction of the rocket's motion. This decreases acceleration of the vehicle and produces structural loads. Deceleration force for fast-moving rockets are calculated using the drag equation.

Drag can be minimised by an aerodynamic nose cone and by using a shape with a high ballistic coefficient (the "classic" rocket shape—long and thin), and by keeping the rocket's angle of attack as low as possible.

During a rocket launch, as the vehicle speed increases, and the atmosphere thins, there is a point of maximum aerodynamic drag called Max Q. This determines the minimum aerodynamic strength of the vehicle, as the rocket must avoid buckling under these forces.<ref name=maxq>cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/aerodynamics/q0025.shtml |title=Space Shuttle Max-Q |publisher=Aerospaceweb |date=2001-05-06 |accessdate=2012-12-10</ref>

A typical rocket engine can handle a significant fraction of its own mass in propellant each second, with the propellant leaving the nozzle at several kilometres per second.

It can be shown that the net thrust of a rocket is:

:<math>F_n = \dot{m}\;v_{e}</math><ref name="RPE7"/>rp|2–14

where:

:<math> \dot{m} =\,</math>propellant flow (kg/s or lb/s)

:<math>v_{e} =\,</math>the effective exhaust velocity (m/s or ft/s)

The effective exhaust velocity <math>v_{e}</math> is more or less the speed the exhaust leaves the vehicle, and in the vacuum of space, the effective exhaust velocity is often equal to the actual average exhaust speed along the thrust axis. However, the effective exhaust velocity allows for various losses, and notably, is reduced when operated within an atmosphere.

The rate of propellant flow through a rocket engine is often deliberately varied over a flight, to provide a way to control the thrust and thus the airspeed of the vehicle. This, for example, allows minimization of aerodynamic losses<ref name=maxq/> and can limit the increase of g-force|''g''-forces due to the reduction in propellant load.

=Total impulse=
Main|Impulse (physics)
Impulse is defined as a force acting on an object over time, which in the absence of opposing forces (gravity and aerodynamic drag), changes the momentum (integral of mass and velocity) of the object. As such, it is the best performance class (payload mass and terminal velocity capability) indicator of a rocket, rather than takeoff thrust, mass, or "power". The total impulse of a rocket (stage) burning its propellant is:<ref name="RPE7"/>rp|27

:<math>I = \int F dt</math>

When there is fixed thrust, this is simply:

:<math>I = F t\;</math>

The total impulse of a multi-stage rocket is the sum of the impulses of the individual stages.
Clear

=Specific impulse=
Main|specific impulse
Specific impulse|align=right
As can be seen from the thrust equation, the effective speed of the exhaust controls the amount of thrust produced from a particular quantity of fuel burnt per second.

An equivalent measure, the net impulse per weight unit of propellant expelled, is called Specific impulse|specific Impulse, <math>I_{sp}</math>, and this is one of the most important figures that describes a rocket's performance. It is defined such that it is related to the effective exhaust velocity by:

:<math>v_e = I_{sp} \cdot g_0</math><ref name="RPE7"/>rp|29

where:
:<math>I_{sp}</math> has units of seconds
:<math>g_0</math> is the acceleration at the surface of the Earth

Thus, the greater the specific impulse, the greater the net thrust and performance of the engine. <math>I_{sp}</math> is determined by measurement while testing the engine. In practice the effective exhaust velocities of rockets varies but can be extremely high, ~4500&nbsp;m/s, about 15 times the sea level speed of sound in air.

Main|Tsiolkovsky rocket equation
The delta-v capacity of a rocket is the theoretical total change in velocity that a rocket can achieve without any external interference (without air drag or gravity or other forces).

When <math>v_e</math> is constant, the delta-v that a rocket vehicle can provide can be calculated from the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation:<ref>cite web |url=http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3c.html |title=Choose Your Engine |publisher=Projectrho.com |date=2012-06-01 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529042131/http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3c.html |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= </ref>

:<math>\Delta v\ = v_e \ln \frac {m_0} {m_1}</math>

where:
:<math>m_0</math> is the initial total mass, including propellant, in kg (or lb)
:<math>m_1</math> is the final total mass in kg (or lb)
:<math>v_e</math> is the effective exhaust velocity in m/s (or ft/s)
:<math>\Delta v\ </math> is the delta-v in m/s (or ft/s)

When launched from the Earth practical delta-vs for a single rockets carrying payloads can be a few km/s. Some theoretical designs have rockets with delta-vs over 9&nbsp;km/s.

The required delta-v can also be calculated for a particular manoeuvre; for example the delta-v to launch from the surface of the Earth to Low earth orbit is about 9.7&nbsp;km/s, which leaves the vehicle with a sideways speed of about 7.8&nbsp;km/s at an altitude of around 200&nbsp;km. In this manoeuvre about 1.9&nbsp;km/s is lost in air drag, gravity drag and potential energy|gaining altitude.

The ratio <math>\frac {m_0} {m_1}</math> is sometimes called the ''mass ratio''.

=Mass ratios=

Rockets as a group have the highest thrust-to-weight ratio of any type of engine; and this helps vehicles achieve high mass ratios, which improves the performance of flights. The higher the ratio, the less engine mass is needed to be carried. This permits the carrying of even more propellant, enormously improving the delta-v. Alternatively, some rockets such as for rescue scenarios or racing carry relatively little propellant and payload and thus need only a lightweight structure and instead achieve high accelerations. For example, the Soyuz escape system can produce 20g.<ref name=soyuzt/>

Achievable mass ratios are highly dependent on many factors such as propellant type, the design of engine the vehicle uses, structural safety margins and construction techniques.

The highest mass ratios are generally achieved with liquid rockets, and these types are usually used for orbital launch vehicles, a situation which calls for a high delta-v. Liquid propellants generally have densities similar to water (with the notable exceptions of liquid hydrogen and Liquid methane rocket fuel|liquid methane), and these types are able to use lightweight, low pressure tanks and typically run high-performance turbopumps to force the propellant into the combustion chamber.

Some notable mass fractions are found in the following table (some aircraft are included for comparison purposes):

=Staging=
File:Artistsconcept separation.jpg|thumb|Spacecraft staging involves dropping off unnecessary parts of the rocket to reduce mass.
File:Ap6-68-HC-191.jpg|thumb|Apollo 6 while dropping the interstage ring
Main|Multistage rocket
Thus far, the required velocity (delta-v) to achieve orbit has been unattained by any single rocket because the propellant, tankage, structure, guidance system|guidance, valves and engines and so on, take a particular minimum percentage of take-off mass that is too great for the propellant it carries to achieve that delta-v carrying reasonable payloads. Since Single-stage-to-orbit has so far not been achievable, orbital rockets always have more than one stage.

For example, the first stage of the Saturn V, carrying the weight of the upper stages, was able to achieve a mass ratio of about 10, and achieved a specific impulse of 263 seconds. This gives a delta-v of around 5.9&nbsp;km/s whereas around 9.4&nbsp;km/s delta-v is needed to achieve orbit with all losses allowed for.

This problem is frequently solved by staging (rocketry)|staging—the rocket sheds excess weight (usually empty tankage and associated engines) during launch. Staging is either ''serial'' where the rockets light after the previous stage has fallen away, or ''parallel'', where rockets are burning together and then detach when they burn out.<ref name="NASAstaging">cite web |author=NASA |url=https://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktstage.html |title=Rocket staging |accessdate=2016-05-28 |publisher=NASA |work=Beginner's Guide to Rockets |year=2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602123849/https://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktstage.html |archivedate=2016-06-02 |df= </ref>

The maximum speeds that can be achieved with staging is theoretically limited only by the speed of light. However the payload that can be carried goes down geometrically with each extra stage needed, while the additional delta-v for each stage is simply additive.

=Acceleration and thrust-to-weight ratio=
Main|thrust-to-weight ratio
From Newton's second law, the acceleration, <math>a</math>, of a vehicle is simply:

:<math>a = \frac {F_n} {m}</math>
Where m is the instantaneous mass of the vehicle and <math>F_n</math> is the net force acting on the rocket (mostly thrust but air drag and other forces can play a part.)

As the remaining propellant decreases, rocket vehicles become lighter and their acceleration tends to increase until the propellant is exhausted. This means that much of the speed change occurs towards the end of the burn when the vehicle is much lighter.<ref name="RPE7"/> However, the thrust can be throttled to offset or vary this if needed. Discontinuities in acceleration also occur when stages burn out, often starting at a lower acceleration with each new stage firing.

Peak accelerations can be increased by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass, usually achieved by a reduction in the fuel load and tankage and associated structures, but obviously this reduces range, delta-v and burn time. Still, for some applications that rockets are used for, a high peak acceleration applied for just a short time is highly desirable.

The minimal mass of vehicle consists of a rocket engine with minimal fuel and structure to carry it. In that case the thrust-to-weight ratio#tag:ref|“thrust-to-weight ratio F/W<sub>g</sub> is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system (expressed in multiples of g<sub>0</sub>) ... in a gravity-free vacuum”<ref name="RPE7"/>rp|442|group=nb of the rocket engine limits the maximum acceleration that can be designed. It turns out that rocket engines generally have truly excellent thrust to weight ratios (137 for the NK-33 engine,<ref>cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/nk33.htm |title=Astronautix NK-33 entry |publisher=Astronautix.com |date=2006-11-08 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020625124013/http://www.astronautix.com/engines/nk33.htm |archivedate=2002-06-25 |df= </ref> some solid rockets are over 1000<ref name="RPE7"/>rp|442), and nearly all really g-force|high-g vehicles employ or have employed rockets.

The high accelerations that rockets naturally possess means that rocket vehicles are often capable of vertical takeoff, and in some cases, with suitable guidance and control of the engines, also VTVL|vertical landing. For these operations to be done it is necessary for a vehicle's engines to provide more than the local gravitational acceleration.

=Energy=

Energy efficiency
File:Atlantis taking off on STS-27.jpg|thumb|OV|104 during launch phase
Main|propulsive efficiency
Rocket launch vehicles take-off with a great deal of flames, noise and drama, and it might seem obvious that they are grievously inefficient. However, while they are far from perfect, their energy efficiency is not as bad as might be supposed.

The energy density of a typical rocket propellant is often around one-third that of conventional hydrocarbon fuels; the bulk of the mass is (often relatively inexpensive) oxidizer. Nevertheless, at take-off the rocket has a great deal of energy in the fuel and oxidizer stored within the vehicle. It is of course desirable that as much of the energy of the propellant end up as kinetic energy|kinetic or potential energy of the body of the rocket as possible.

Energy from the fuel is lost in air drag and gravity drag and is used for the rocket to gain altitude and speed. However, much of the lost energy ends up in the exhaust.<ref name="RPE7"/>rp|37–38

In a chemical propulsion device, the engine efficiency is simply the ratio of the kinetic power of the exhaust gases and the power available from the chemical reaction:<ref name="RPE7"/>rp|37–38

:<math>\eta_c= \frac {\frac {1} {2}\dot{m}v_e^2} {\eta_{combustion} P_{chem} }</math>

100% efficiency within the engine (engine efficiency <math>\eta_c = 100\%</math>) would mean that all the heat energy of the combustion products is converted into kinetic energy of the jet. Heat Engine#Efficiency|This is not possible, but the near-adiabatic rocket engine nozzle|high expansion ratio nozzles that can be used with rockets come surprisingly close: when the nozzle expands the gas, the gas is cooled and accelerated, and an energy efficiency of up to 70% can be achieved. Most of the rest is heat energy in the exhaust that is not recovered.<ref name="RPE7"/>rp|37–38 The high efficiency is a consequence of the fact that rocket combustion can be performed at very high temperatures and the gas is finally released at much lower temperatures, and so giving good Carnot efficiency.

However, engine efficiency is not the whole story. In common with the other jet engine|jet-based engines, but particularly in rockets due to their high and typically fixed exhaust speeds, rocket vehicles are extremely inefficient at low speeds irrespective of the engine efficiency. The problem is that at low speeds, the exhaust carries away a huge amount of kinetic energy rearward. This phenomenon is termed propulsive efficiency (<math>\eta_p</math>).<ref name="RPE7"/>rp|37–38

However, as speeds rise, the resultant exhaust speed goes down, and the overall vehicle energetic efficiency rises, reaching a peak of around 100% of the engine efficiency when the vehicle is travelling exactly at the same speed that the exhaust is emitted. In this case the exhaust would ideally stop dead in space behind the moving vehicle, taking away zero energy, and from conservation of energy, all the energy would end up in the vehicle. The efficiency then drops off again at even higher speeds as the exhaust ends up traveling forwards – trailing behind the vehicle.

File:Average propulsive efficiency of rockets.png|thumb|Plot of instantaneous propulsive efficiency (blue) and overall efficiency for a rocket accelerating from rest (red) as percentages of the engine efficiencyFrom these principles it can be shown that the propulsive efficiency <math>\eta_p</math> for a rocket moving at speed <math>u</math> with an exhaust velocity <math>c</math> is:
:<math>\eta_p= \frac {2 \frac {u} {c {1 + ( \frac {u} {c} )^2 }</math><ref name="RPE7"/>rp|37–38

And the overall (instantaneous) energy efficiency <math>\eta</math> is:
:<math>\eta= \eta_p \eta_c</math>

For example, from the equation, with an <math>\eta_c</math> of 0.7, a rocket flying at Mach 0.85 (which most aircraft cruise at) with an exhaust velocity of Mach 10, would have a predicted overall energy efficiency of 5.9%, whereas a conventional, modern, air-breathing jet engine achieves closer to 35% efficiency. Thus a rocket would need about 6x more energy; and allowing for the specific energy of rocket propellant being around one third that of conventional air fuel, roughly 18x more mass of propellant would need to be carried for the same journey. This is why rockets are rarely if ever used for general aviation.

Since the energy ultimately comes from fuel, these considerations mean that rockets are mainly useful when a very high speed is required, such as ICBMs or orbital spaceflight|orbital launch. For example, NASA's space shuttle fires its engines for around 8.5 minutes, consuming 1,000&nbsp;tonnes of solid propellant (containing 16% aluminium) and an additional 2,000,000&nbsp;litres of liquid propellant (106,261&nbsp;kg of liquid hydrogen fuel) to lift the 100,000&nbsp;kg vehicle (including the 25,000&nbsp;kg payload) to an altitude of 111&nbsp;km and an orbital velocity of 30,000&nbsp;km/h. At this altitude and velocity, the vehicle has a kinetic energy of about 3&nbsp;TJ and a potential energy of roughly 200&nbsp;GJ. Given the initial energy of 20&nbsp;TJ,#tag:ref|The energy density is 31MJ per kg for aluminum and 143&nbsp;MJ/kg for liquid hydrogen, this means that the vehicle consumes around 5&nbsp;TJ of solid propellant and 15&nbsp;TJ of hydrogen fuel.|group=nb the Space Shuttle is about 16% energy efficient at launching the orbiter.

Thus jet engines, with a better match between speed and jet exhaust speed (such as turbofans—in spite of their worse <math>\eta_c</math>)—dominate for subsonic and supersonic atmospheric use, while rockets work best at hypersonic speeds. On the other hand, rockets serve in many short-range ''relatively'' low speed military applications where their low-speed inefficiency is outweighed by their extremely high thrust and hence high accelerations.

Oberth effect
Main|Oberth effect
One subtle feature of rockets relates to energy. A rocket stage, while carrying a given load, is capable of giving a particular delta-v. This delta-v means that the speed increases (or decreases) by a particular amount, independent of the initial speed. However, because kinetic energy is a square law on speed, this means that the faster the rocket is travelling before the burn the more orbital energy it gains or loses.

This fact is used in interplanetary travel. It means that the amount of delta-v to reach other planets, over and above that to reach escape velocity can be much less if the delta-v is applied when the rocket is travelling at high speeds, close to the Earth or other planetary surface; whereas waiting until the rocket has slowed at altitude multiplies up the effort required to achieve the desired trajectory.

The reliability of rockets, as for all physical systems, is dependent on the quality of engineering design and construction.

Costs and economics
The costs of rockets can be roughly divided into propellant costs, the costs of obtaining and/or producing the 'dry mass' of the rocket, and the costs of any required support equipment and facilities.<ref name=aday>[http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/rocketaday.html "A Rocket a Day Keeps the High Costs Away"] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103045215/http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/rocketaday.html |date=2008-11-03  by John Walker.

Most of the takeoff mass of a rocket is normally propellant. However propellant is seldom more than a few times more expensive than gasoline per kilogram (as of 2009 gasoline was about convert|1|$/kg|abbr=on|disp=sqbr or less), and although substantial amounts are needed, for all but the very cheapest rockets, it turns out that the propellant costs are usually comparatively small, although not completely negligible.<ref name=aday/> With liquid oxygen costing convert|0.15|$/kg and liquid hydrogen convert|2.20|$/kg|abbr=on, the Space Shuttle in 2009 had a liquid propellant expense of approximately $1.4 million for each launch that cost $450 million from other expenses (with 40% of the mass of propellants used by it being liquids in the external fuel tank, 60% solids in the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|SRBs).<ref>cite web|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/pdf/ssp.pdf |title=Space Shuttle Use of Propellants and Fluids |publisher=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017180215/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/pdf/SSP.pdf |archivedate=October 17, 2011 </ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/nasafact/count2.htm |title=NASA Launch Vehicles and Facilities |publisher=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427020520/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/nasafact/count2.htm |archivedate=2011-04-27 |df= </ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/shuttle_faq.html |title=NASA – Space Shuttle and International Space Station |publisher=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507113329/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/shuttle_faq.html |archivedate=2011-05-07 |df= </ref>

Even though a rocket's non-propellant, dry mass is often only between 5–20% of total mass,<ref>cite web |url=http://www.spacetethers.com/massfraction.html |title=Mass Fraction |publisher=Andrews Space and Technology (original figure source) |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425073303/http://www.spacetethers.com/massfraction.html |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= </ref> nevertheless this cost dominates. For hardware with the performance used in orbital launch vehicles, expenses of $2000–$10,000+ per kilogram of dry weight are common, primarily from engineering, fabrication, and testing; raw materials amount to typically around 2% of total expense.<ref>Regis, Ed (1990),''Great Mambo Chicken And The Transhuman Condition: Science Slightly Over The Edge'', Basic Books, ISBN|0-201-56751-2.

Retrieved April 29, 2011.</ref> For most rockets except reusable ones (shuttle engines) the engines need not function more than a few minutes, which simplifies design.

Extreme performance requirements for rockets reaching orbit correlate with high cost, including intensive quality control to ensure reliability despite the limited safety factors allowable for weight reasons.<ref name=CheapRockets/> Components produced in small numbers if not individually machined can prevent amortization of R&D and facility costs over mass production to the degree seen in more pedestrian manufacturing.<ref name=CheapRockets/> Amongst liquid-fueled rockets, complexity can be influenced by how much hardware must be lightweight, like pressure-fed engines can have two orders of magnitude lesser part count than pump-fed engines but lead to more weight by needing greater tank pressure, most often used in just small maneuvering thrusters as a consequence.<ref name=CheapRockets/>

To change the preceding factors for orbital launch vehicles, proposed methods have included mass-producing simple rockets in large quantities or on large scale,<ref name=aday/> or developing reusable launch system|reusable rockets meant to fly very frequently to amortize their up-front expense over many payloads, or reducing rocket performance requirements by constructing a non-rocket spacelaunch system for part of the velocity to orbit (or all of it but with most methods involving some rocket use).

The costs of support equipment, range costs and launch pads generally scale up with the size of the rocket, but vary less with launch rate, and so may be considered to be approximately a fixed cost.<ref name=aday/>

Rockets in applications other than launch to orbit (such as military rockets and JATO|rocket-assisted take off), commonly not needing comparable performance and sometimes mass-produced, are often relatively inexpensive.
