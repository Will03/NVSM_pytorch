The illumination problem is a resolved mathematical problem first posed by Ernst Straus in the 1950s.<ref name="Weisstein">Cite web

  | accessdate = 19 December 2010</ref> Straus asked if a room with mirrored walls can always be illuminated by a single point light source, allowing for repeated reflection of light off the mirrored walls. Alternatively, the question can be stated as asking that if a billiard table can be constructed in any required shape, is there a shape possible such that there is a point where it is impossible to Cuegloss|Pot|pot the cue ball|billiard ball in a Cuegloss|Pocket|pocket at another point, assuming the ball is point-like and continues infinitely rather than stopping due to friction.

The problem was first solved in 1958 by Roger Penrose using ellipses to form the ''Penrose unilluminable room''.<ref name="Weisstein"/> He showed there exists a room with curved walls that must always have dark regions if lit only by a single point source. This problem was also solved for polygonal rooms by George Tokarsky in 1995 for 2 dimensions, which showed there exists an unilluminable polygonal 26-sided room with a "dark spot" which is not illuminated from another point in the room, even allowing for repeated reflections.<ref>Cite journal

An improved solution was put forward by D. Castro in 1997, with a 24-sided room with the same properties.<ref>Cite journal

In 2016, Lelièvre, Monteil and Weiss showed that a light source in a polygonal room whose angles (in degrees) are all rational numbers will illuminate the entire polygon, with the possible exception of a finite number of points.<ref>cite journal |last1=Lelièvre |first1=Samuel |last2=Monteil |first2=Thierry |last3=Weiss |first3=Barak |title=Everything is illuminated |journal=Geometry & Topology |date=4 July 2016 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=1737–1762 |doi=10.2140/gt.2016.20.1737 </ref>
