The Japanese and Korean term ''mu'' (CJKV|j=無|k=무) or Chinese ''wu'' (CJKV|t=無|s=无), meaning "not have; without", is a key word in Buddhism, especially Zen traditions.

The word
The Chinese word ''wú'' 無 "not; nothing" was borrowed by East Asian languages, particularly the Sino-Xenic "CJKV" languages of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese.

=Pronunciations=
The Standard Chinese pronunciation ''wú'' historically derives from (c. 7th century CE) Middle Chinese ''mju'', (c. 3rd century CE) Late Han Chinese ''muɑ'', and reconstructed (c. 6th century BCE) Old Chinese *''ma''.<ref name="Schuessler">cite book|ref=harv|last=Schuessler|first=Axel|authorlink=Axel Schuessler|title=ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIvqAC7FNBQC|year=2007|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2975-9, p. 518.</ref>

Other varieties of Chinese have differing pronunciations of zh|c=無. Compare Cantonese ''mou4''; and Southern Min IPA-all|bo˧˥ (Quanzhou) and IPA-all|bə˧˥ (Zhangzhou).

The common Chinese word ''wú'' 無 was adopted in the Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese, Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean, and Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese vocabularies. The Japanese ''kanji'' 無 has ''Kanji#On'yomi|on'yomi'' readings of ''mu'' or ''bu'', and a ''Kanji#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|kun'yomi'' (Japanese reading) of ''na''. The Korean ''hanja'' 無 is read ''mu'' (in Revised Romanization of Korean|Revised, McCune–Reischauer, and Yale romanization of Korean|Yale romanization systems). The Vietnamese Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Hán-Việt pronunciation is ''vô'' or ''mô''.

=Etymology=
Old Chinese *''ma'' 無 is cognate with the Proto-Tibeto-Burman language|Proto-Tibeto-Burman *''ma'' "not". This reconstructed root is widely represented in Tibeto-Burman languages; for instance, ''ma'' means "not" in both Written Tibetan and Written Burmese.<ref>Schuesler, p. 519.</ref>

=Characters=
In traditional Chinese character classification, the uncommon class of Chinese character classification#Rebus (phonetic loan) characters|phonetic loan characters involved borrowing the character for one word to write another near-homophone. For instance, the character 其 originally depicted a ''ji'' "winnowing basket", and scribes used it as a graphic loan for ''qi'' 其 "his; her; its", which resulted in a new character ''ji'' 箕 (clarified with the Radical 118|bamboo radical ⺮) to specify the basket.

The character ''wu'' wikt:無|無 originally meant "dance" and was later used as a graphic loan for ''wu'' "not". The earliest graphs for 無 pictured a person with outstretched arms holding something (possibly sleeves, tassels, ornaments) and represented the word ''wu'' "dance; dancer". After ''wu'' 無 "dance" was borrowed as a loan for ''wu'' "not; without", the original meaning was elucidated with the 舛 "Radical 136|opposite feet" at the bottom of ''wu'' wikt:舞|舞 "dance".

The Mu-koan
''The Gateless Gate'', which is a 13th-century collection of Chan or Zen kōans,  uses the word ''wu'' or ''mu'' in its title (''Wumenguan'' or ''Mumonkan'' 無門關) and first kōan case ("Zhao Zhou's Dog" 趙州狗子). Chinese Chan calls the word ''mu'' 無 "the gate to enlightenment".<ref>Muller.</ref> The Japanese Rinzai school classifies the Mu Kōan as ''hosshin'' wikt:発心|発心 "resolve to attain enlightenment", that is, appropriate for beginners seeking ''kenshō'' "to see the Buddha-nature"'.<ref>Baroni, p. 228.</ref>

=Origins=
In the original text, the question is used as a conventional beginning to a question-and-answer exchange (mondo (scripture)|mondo). The reference is to the ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra''<ref>cite book |title=Sitting with Koans: essential writings on Zen Koan introspection |last=Loori |first=J.D. |authorlink=John Daido Loori |year=2005 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |location=Somerville, MA |isbn=978-0-86171-369-1 |page=266 </ref> which says for example:

Koan 363 in the ''Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu'' shares the same beginning question.<ref>Cite book |last=Green |first=James, ed. and trans. |title=The Recorded Sayings of Zen Master Joshu |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Rowman Altamira |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7619-8985-1 |page=116</ref>

=Interpretations=
This koan is one of several traditionally used by Rinzai school to initiate students into Zen study,<ref name="baroni"/> and interpretations of it vary widely. Hakuun Yasutani of the Sanbo Kyodan maintained that
quote|The koan is not about whether a dog does or does not have a Buddha-nature because everything is Buddha-nature, and either a positive or negative answer is absurd because there is no particular thing called Buddha-nature.<ref>Grenard, Jerry L. "The Phenomenology of Koan Meditation in Zen Buddhism". ''Journal of Phenomenological Psychology'' 39 (2008) 151–188.</ref>

This koan is discussed in Part 1 of Hau Hoo's ''The Sound of the One Hand: 281 Zen Koans with Answers''. In it, the answer of "negative", mu, is clarified as although all beings have potential Buddha-nature, beings who do not have the capacity to see it and develop it essentially do not have it. The purpose of this primary koan to a student is to free the mind from analytic thinking and into intuitive knowing. A student who understands the nature of his question would understand the importance of awareness of potential to begin developing it.<ref>Hau, "The Sound of the One Hand: 281 Zen Koans with Answers", 1975</ref>

One-sided interpretation
The Japanese scholar Ruth Fuller Sasaki#Her research team in Kyoto|Iriya Yoshitaka made the following comment on the two versions of the koan:
quote|I have held doubts for some time even with regard to the way the so-called "Chao-chou's Word No" has been previously dealt with. To the question "Does a dog have the Buddha-nature?", on the one hand Monk Chao-chou replied affirmatively, but on the other hand he replied negatively. However, Zen adherents in Japan have rendered the koan exclusively in terms of his negative response, and completely ignored the affirmative one. Moreover, it has been the custom from the outset to reject the affirmative response as superficial compared to the negative one. It seems that the ''The Gateless Gate|Wu-men kuan'' is responsible for this peculiarity.<ref>cite book |title=The Zen canon: understanding the classic texts |last=Heine |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Heine |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-19-515067-4 |page=230 </ref>

A similar critique has been given by Steven Heine:
quote|The common approach espoused [...] emphasizes a particular understanding of the role of the koan based on the “head-word” or “critical phrase” method developed by the prominent twelfth century Chinese master, Dahui Zonggao|Daie. This approach takes the “Mu” response in a non-literal way to express a transcendental negation that becomes the topic of an intensive contemplative experience, during which any and all thoughts or uses of reason and words are to be cut off and discarded for good rather than investigated for their expressive nuances and ramifications. Yet, historical studies demonstrate quite persuasively that an overemphasis on this single approach to one version of the kōan is somewhat misleading.<ref>[http://blog.oup.com/2012/04/four-myths-about-zen-buddhisms-mu-koan/ Steven Heine, ''Four myths about Zen Buddhism’s “Mu Koan”'']</ref>

"Unasking" the question
The term is often used or translated to mean that the question itself must be "unasked": no answer can exist in the terms provided. Zhaozhou's answer, which literally means that dogs do not have Buddha nature, has been interpreted by Robert M. Pirsig|Robert Pirsig and Douglas Hofstadter to mean that such categorical thinking is a delusion, that yes and no are both correct and incorrect.

In popular culture

In Robert M. Pirsig's 1974 novel ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'', ''mu'' is translated as "no thing", saying that it meant "unask the question". He offered the example of a electronic circuit|computer circuit using the binary numeral system, in effect using ''mu'' to represent high impedance:
quote|For example, it's stated over and over again that computer circuits exhibit only two states, a voltage for "one" and a voltage for "zero." That's silly! Any computer-electronics technician knows otherwise. Try to find a voltage representing one or zero when the power is off! The circuits are in a ''mu'' state.''<ref>Cite book |last=Pirsig |first=Robert M. |authorlink=Robert M. Pirsig |title=Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values |location=New York
|publisher=Harper Perennial |id=First Perennial Classics edition |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-06-095832-9 |page=328 |url=</ref>

The word features prominently with a similar meaning in Douglas Hofstadter's 1979 book, ''Gödel, Escher, Bach''. It is used fancifully in discussions of First-order logic|symbolic logic, particularly Gödel's incompleteness theorems, to indicate a question whose "answer" is to
* un-ask the question,
* indicate the question is fundamentally flawed, or
* reject the premise that a non-dual|dualistic answer can or will be given.<ref>Cite book  | last1 = Hofstadter| first1 = Douglas R.  | title = Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid  | publisher = Basic Books  | year = 1999  | origyear= 1979  | isbn = 978-0-465-02656-2 .</ref>

"Mu" may be used similarly to "wikt:N/A|N/A" or "not applicable," a term often used to indicate the question cannot be answered because the conditions of the question do not match the reality. A layperson's example of this concept is often invoked by the loaded question "Have you stopped beating your wife?",<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dstZTHdMn8U NBA Commish David Stern to Jim Rome "Do you still beat your wife?" – YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> to which "mu" would be the only respectable response.<ref>cite web | url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/mu.html | title=mu | work=The New Hackers' Dictionary (Jargon File) | last=Raymond | first=Eric S. | authorlink=Eric S. Raymond</ref>

Because of this meaning, programming language Perl 6 uses "Mu" for the root of its type hierarchy.<ref>[http://doc.perl6.org/type/Mu class Mu<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In the Japanese manga series, ''Death Note'', ends in a thematic conclusion which contains MU's usage as "not applicable": "All humans, without exception, will eventually die. The place they go after is MU (無, Nothingness)".<ref name="deathnote1">cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 12|year=2007|page=188|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-1327-0</ref>

Tsugumi Ohba, the writer of ''Death Note'', explained in the postmortem follow-up volume that the meaning behind "MU after death" was that "the dead person should never come back to life, and it's cheating to revive dead characters as manga. So it became MU". Ohba further explained that "all humans die someday, and when we die, we can never come back to life, so let's do our best while we are at it" was the single most important theme Ohba wanted to express in writing the series.<ref name="deathnote2">cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|page=68|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-1888-6</ref>
