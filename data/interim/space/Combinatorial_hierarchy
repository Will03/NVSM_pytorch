The combinatorial hierarchy is a mathematics|mathematical structure of hierarchical sets of "Bit-string_physics|bit-strings" generated from an algorithm based on Distinction (philosophy)|"discrimination" (or equivalently XOR). Discovered by Frederick Parker-Rhodes, the hierarchy gives the physical coupling constants from a simple aphysical model. Remarkably, the relative strengths of the four forces—such as the Dimensionless physical constant|dimensionless electromagnetic (fine-structure constant) or gravitational coupling constant—can be produced from the hierarchy, without any reference to physics.
