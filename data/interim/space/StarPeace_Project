The StarPeace Project was a global special project first organised in conjunction with the International Year of Astronomy in 2009.<ref>[http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/specialprojects/ List of IYA Special Projects]</ref> StarPeace project participants held public star party|star parties near a border of their country with a neighboring country. The intention was to show that there are no borders in the real Earth, borders are man-made and science has no borders.<ref>[http://starpeace.org/En/Project/Default.aspx/ ''StarPeace Project'']</ref><ref>[http://www.irpedia.com/iran-news/1025/ ''Iran, the Land of Civilization and Friendship'']</ref>

Vision
In accordance with the goals of the International Year of Astronomy 2009, the Starpeace project has these aims:

*To encourage astronomy groups in one country to cooperate with those in neighboring countries, creating a network of active astronomy groups in that region.
*To give particular encouragement to the growth and survival of astronomy groups in developing countries.
*To use these star parties as a means of increasing scientific awareness and to improve the knowledge of astronomy through talks and photographs.
*To make a contribution towards regional peace and harmony. 
*To provide an opportunity for people to use astronomical equipment that they might not otherwise have encountered or experienced at first hand.
