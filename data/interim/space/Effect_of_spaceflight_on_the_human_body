The engineering problems associated with leaving Earth and developing space propulsion systems have been examined for over a century, and millions of man-hours of research have been spent on them. In recent years there has been an increase in research on the issue of how humans can survive and work in space for extended and possibly indefinite periods of time. This question requires input from the physical and biological sciences and has now become the greatest challenge (other than funding) facing human space exploration. A fundamental step in overcoming this challenge is trying to understand the effects and impact of long-term space travel on the human body.

In October 2015, the NASA Office of Inspector General issued a health hazards report related to human space exploration|space exploration, including a human mission to Mars|human mission to Mars.<ref name="AP-20151029">cite news |last=Dunn |first=Marcia |title=Report: NASA needs better handle on health hazards for Mars |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20151029/us-sci-space-travel-health-6dfd5b2c76.html |date=October 29, 2015 |work=AP News |accessdate=October 30, 2015 </ref><ref name="NASA-20151029oig">cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA's Efforts to Manage Health and Human Performance Risks for Space Exploration (IG-16-003) |url=https://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY16/IG-16-003.pdf |format=PDF |date=October 29, 2015 |work=NASA |accessdate=October 29, 2015 </ref>

Physiological effects
Many of the Environment (biophysical)|environmental conditions experienced by humans during spaceflight are very different from those in which humans evolved; however, technology such as that offered by a spaceship or spacesuit is able to shield people from the harshest conditions. The immediate needs for breathable air and drinkable water are addressed by a life support system, a group of devices that allow human beings to survive in outer space.<ref>cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast13nov_1.htm |title=Breathing Easy on the Space Station |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921141609/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast13nov_1.htm |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= </ref> The life support system supplies air, water and space food|food. It must also maintain temperature and pressure within acceptable limits and space toilet|deal with the body's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites is also necessary.

Some hazards are difficult to mitigate, such as weightlessness, also defined as a Micro-g environment|microgravity environment. Living in this type of environment impacts the body in three important ways: loss of proprioception, changes in fluid distribution, and deterioration of the musculoskeletal system.

On 2 November 2017, scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the brain have been found in astronauts who have taken Human spaceflight|trips in space, based on Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI studies. Astronauts who took longer space trips were associated with greater brain changes.<ref name="NEJM-20171102">cite journal |author=Roberts, Donna R. et al. |title=Effects of Spaceflight on Astronaut Brain Structure as Indicated on MRI |date=2 November 2017 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=377 |issue=18 |pages=1746–1753  |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1705129 </ref><ref name="QTZ-20171103">cite web |last=Foley |first=Katherine Ellen |title=Astronauts who take long trips to space return with brains that have floated to the top of their skulls |url=https://qz.com/1119668/space-travel-changes-astronauts-brains/ |date=3 November 2017 |work=Quartz (publication)|Quartz |accessdate=3 November 2017 </ref>

In October 2018, NASA-funded researchers found that lengthy journeys into outer space, including travel to the Mars|planet Mars, may substantially damage the  Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tissues of astronauts.

=Research=
Main|Space medicine
Space medicine is a developing medicine|medical practice that studies the health of astronauts living in outer space. The main purpose of this academic pursuit is to discover how well and for how long people can survive the extreme conditions in space, and how fast they can re-adapt to the Earth's environment after returning from space. Space medicine also seeks to develop Preventive medicine|preventative and Palliative care|palliative measures to ease the suffering caused by living in an environment to which humans are not well adapted.

=Ascent and reentry=
See also|High-G training
During takeoff and reentry space travelers can experience several times normal gravity. An untrained person can usually withstand about 3g, but can blackout at 4 to 6g. G-force in the vertical direction is more difficult to tolerate than a force perpendicular to the spine because blood flows away from the brain and eyes. First the person experiences temporary loss of vision and then at higher g-forces loses consciousness. G-force training and a G-suit which constricts the body to keep more blood in the head can mitigate the effects. Most spacecraft are designed to keep g-forces within comfortable limits.

=Space environments=
The environment of space is lethal without appropriate protection: the greatest threat in the vacuum of space derives from the lack of oxygen and pressure, although temperature and radiation also pose risks. The effects of space exposure can result in ebullism, hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia, hypocapnia, and decompression sickness. In addition to these, there is also Health threat from cosmic rays|cellular mutation and Cell death|destruction from high energy photons and Subatomic particle|sub-atomic particles that are present in the surroundings.<ref name = Pilmanis2003>cite journal|last=Pilmanis|first=Andrew|author2=William Sears |title=Physiological hazards of flight at high altitude|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2003|volume=362|pages=s16–s17|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)15059-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603150593</ref> Decompression is a serious concern during the Extra-vehicular activity|extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) of astronauts.<ref name="Conkin2001">Conkin, Johnny (January 2001), [http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2001-210196.pdf "Evidence-Based Approach to the Analysis of Serious Decompression Sickness With Application to EVA Astronauts"] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005100715/http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2001-210196.pdf |date=2006-10-05  NASA TP-2001-210196.

Image:An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1768.jpg|thumb|This painting, ''An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump'' depicts an experiment performed by Robert Boyle in 1660 to test the effect of a vacuum on a living system.

Human physiology is adapted to living within the atmosphere of Earth, and a certain amount of oxygen is required in Breathing gas|the air we breathe. If the body does not get enough oxygen, then the astronaut is at risk of becoming unconscious and dying from Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia. In the vacuum of space, gas exchange in the lungs continues as normal but results in the removal of all gases, including oxygen, from the bloodstream. After 9 to 12 seconds, the deoxygenated blood reaches the brain, and it results in the loss of consciousness.<ref name=Landis>cite web |url=http://www.geoffreylandis.com/vacuum.html |title=Human Exposure to Vacuum |date=7 August 2007 |first=Geoffrey A. |last=Landis |authorlink=Geoffrey A.

In December 1966, Aerospace engineering|aerospace engineer and test subject Jim LeBlanc of NASA was partaking in a test to see how well a pressurized Apollo/Skylab A7L|space suit prototype would perform in vacuum conditions.

Temperature
In a vacuum, there is no medium for removing heat from the body by conduction or convection. Loss of heat is by radiation from the 310 K temperature of a person to the 3 K of outer space. This is a slow process, especially in a clothed person, so there is no danger of immediately freezing.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99383.htm |title=Ask a scientist. Why is space cold? |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory, Division of Educational Programs</ref> Rapid evaporative cooling of skin moisture in a vacuum may create frost, particularly in the mouth, but this is not a significant hazard.

Exposure to the intense radiation of direct, unfiltered sunlight would lead to local heating, though that would likely be well distributed by the body's conductivity and blood circulation. Other solar radiation, particularly ultraviolet rays, however, may cause severe sunburn.

Crew living on the International Space Station (ISS) are partially protected from the space environment by Earth's magnetic field, as the magnetosphere deflects solar wind around the earth and the ISS. Nevertheless, solar flares are powerful enough to warp and penetrate the magnetic defences, and so are still a hazard to the crew. The crew of Expedition 10 took shelter as a precaution in 2005 in a more heavily shielded part of the station designed for this purpose.<ref>cite web|title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars|author=Ker Than|publisher=Space.com|date=23 February 2006|url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html</ref><ref>cite web|title=A new kind of solar storm|publisher=NASA|date=10 June 2005|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/</ref> However, beyond the limited protection of Earth's magnetosphere, interplanetary manned missions are much more vulnerable.

In particular, it causes 'chromosomal aberrations' in lymphocytes. As these cells are central to the immune system, any damage weakens the immune system, which means that in addition to increased vulnerability to new exposures, viruses already present in the body—which would normally be suppressed—become active. In space, T-cells (a form of lymphocyte) are less able to reproduce properly, and the T-cells that do reproduce are less able to fight off infection. Over time immunodeficiency results in the rapid spread of infection among crew members, especially in the confined areas of space flight systems.

Following the advent of space stations that can be inhabited for long periods of time, exposure to weightlessness has been demonstrated to have some deleterious effects on human health. Humans are well-adapted to the physical conditions at the surface of the earth, and so in response to weightlessness, various Biological system|physiological systems begin to change, and in some cases, atrophy. Though these changes are usually temporary, some do have a long-term impact on human health.

Short-term exposure to microgravity causes space adaptation syndrome, a self-limiting nausea caused by derangement of the vestibular system. Long-term exposure causes multiple health problems, one of the most significant being loss of bone and muscle mass. Over time these deconditioning effects can impair astronauts' performance, increase their risk of injury, reduce their aerobic capacity, and slow down their cardiovascular system.<ref>cite web |url=http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/SOPO/ICHO/HRP/ExPC/ |title=Exercise Physiology and Countermeasures Project (ExPC): Keeping Astronauts Healthy in Reduced Gravity |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504165244/http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/SOPO/ICHO/HRP/ExPC/ |archivedate=2012-05-04 |df= </ref> As the human body consists mostly of fluids, gravity tends to force them into the lower half of the body, and our bodies have many systems to balance this situation. When released from the pull of gravity, these systems continue to work, causing a general redistribution of fluids into the upper half of the body. This is the cause of the round-faced 'puffiness' seen in astronauts.<ref name="JCB"/> Redistributing fluids around the body itself causes balance disorders, distorted vision, and a loss of taste and smell.

Motion sickness
Main|Space adaptation syndrome|Motion sickness
File:Bruce McCandless II during EVA in 1984.jpg|thumb|right|Bruce McCandless floating free in orbit with a space suit and Manned Maneuvering Unit.
The most common problem experienced by humans in the initial hours of weightlessness is known as space adaptation syndrome or SAS, commonly referred to as space sickness. It is related to motion sickness, and arises as the vestibular system adapts to weightlessness.<ref name="sciencedaily">cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080521112119.htm | title = Why Do Astronauts Suffer From Space Sickness? | publisher = ScienceDaily | date = 2008-05-23 </ref> Symptoms of SAS include nausea and vomiting, Vertigo (medical)|vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise.<ref name=spp22_15/> The first case of SAS was reported by cosmonaut Gherman Titov in 1961. Since then, roughly 45% of all people who have flown in space have suffered from this condition. The duration of space sickness varies, but rarely has it lasted for more than 72 hours,<!-- Not always, per Kanas and Manzey (2008) --> after which the body adjusts to the new environment.

On Earth, our bodies react automatically to gravity, maintaining both posture and locomotion in a downward pulling world. In microgravity environments, these constant signals are absent: the otolith organs in the inner ear are sensitive to linear acceleration and no longer perceive a downwards bias; muscles are no longer required to contract to maintain posture, and pressure receptors in the feet and ankles no longer signal the direction of "down". These changes can immediately result in visual-orientation illusions where the astronaut feels he has flipped 180 degrees.  Over half of astronauts also experience symptoms of motion sickness for the first three days of travel due to the conflict between what the body expects and what the body actually perceives.<ref>cite web|url=http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.cfm?exp_index=747 |title=The Effects of Long-Duration Space Flight on Eye, Head, and Trunk Coordination During Locomotion (9307191) |date=1996 |author1=Bloomberg, Jacob J. |author2=Kozlovskaya, Inessa B. |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207204112/http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.cfm?exp_index=747 |archivedate=2012-02-07 |df= </ref> Over time however the brain adapts and although these illusions can still occur, most astronauts begin to see "down" as where the feet are. People returning to Earth after extended weightless periods have to readjust to the force of gravity and may have problems standing up, focusing their gaze, walking and turning. This is just an initial problem, as they recover these abilities quickly.vague|date=June 2012

NASA jokingly measures SAS using the "Garn scale", named for United States Senator Jake Garn, whose sickness during STS-51-D was the worst on record. Accordingly, one "Garn" is equivalent to the most severe possible case of space sickness.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/StevensonRE/RES_5-13-99.pdf |title=Oral History 2 Transcript |date=13 May 1999 |author1=Robert E. Stevenson |author2=interviewed by Carol Butler |quote=Jake Garn was sick, was pretty sick.  I don't know whether we should tell stories like that. But anyway, Jake Garn, he has made a mark in the Astronaut Corps because he represents the maximum level of space sickness that anyone can ever attain, and so the mark of being totally sick and totally incompetent is one Garn.  Most guys will get maybe to a tenth Garn, if that high.  And within the Astronaut Corps, he forever will be remembered by that. |work=Johnson Space Center Oral History Project |accessdate=2012-05-10 </ref> By studying how changes can affect balance in the human body—involving the senses, the brain, the inner ear, and blood pressure—NASA hopes to develop treatments that can be used on Earth and in space to correct balance disorders. Until then, astronauts rely on medication, such as midodrine and dimenhydrinate anti-nausea patches, as required (such as when space suits are worn, because vomiting into a space suit could be fatal).

Bone and muscle deterioration
Main|Spaceflight osteopenia
File:Frank De Winne on treadmill cropped.jpg|thumb|Aboard the International Space Station, astronaut Frank De Winne is attached to the COLBERT with bungee cords
A major effect of long-term weightlessness involves the loss of bone and muscle mass. Without the effects of gravity, skeletal muscle is no longer required to maintain posture and the muscle groups used in moving around in a weightless environment differ from those required in terrestrial locomotion.Citation needed|date=February 2007 In a weightless environment, astronauts put almost no weight on the back muscles or leg muscles used for standing up.  Those muscles then start to weaken and eventually get smaller. Consequently, some muscles atrophy rapidly, and without regular exercise astronauts can lose up to 20% of their muscle mass in just 5 to 11 days<ref>cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/64249main_ffs_factsheets_hbp_atrophy.pdf |title=Muscle Atrophy |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2013-08-03</ref> The types of muscle fibre prominent in muscles also change. Slow twitch endurance fibres used to maintain posture are replaced by fast twitch rapidly contracting fibres that are insufficient for any heavy labour. Advances in research on exercise, hormone supplements and medication may help maintain muscle and body mass.

Bone metabolism also changes. Normally, bone is laid down in the direction of mechanical stress. However, in a microgravity environment there is very little mechanical stress. This results in a Spaceflight osteopenia|loss of bone tissue approximately 1.5% per month especially from the lower vertebrae, hip and femur.<ref name=NASAbones>cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast01oct_1.htm |title=Space Bones |date=October 1, 2001 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-05-12 </ref> Due to microgravity and the decreased load on the bones, there is a rapid increase in bone loss, from 3% cortical bone loss per decade to about 1% every month the body is exposed to microgravity, for an otherwise healthy adult.<ref>O'Flaherty EJ. Modeling Normal Aging Bone Loss, with Consideration of Bone Loss in Osteoporosis. Toxicol Sci 55 (1): 171–88, 2000.</ref> The rapid change in bone density is dramatic, making bones frail and resulting in symptoms which resemble those of osteoporosis. On Earth, the bones are constantly being shed and regenerated through a well-balanced system which involves signaling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.<ref>Rodan GA. Bone Homeostasis. P Natl A Sci USA 95 (23): 13361–62, 1998.</ref> These systems are coupled, so that whenever bone is broken down, newly formed layers take its place—neither should happen without the other, in a healthy adult. In space, however, there is an increase in osteoclast activity due to microgravity. This is a problem, because osteoclasts break down the bones into minerals that are reabsorbed by the body.<ref>Citation needed</ref> Osteoblasts are not consecutively active with the osteoclasts, causing the bone to be constantly diminished with no recovery.<ref>Blaber E, Dvorochkin N, Lee C, Alwood JS, Yousuf R, Pianetta P, Globus RK, Burns BP, Almeida EAC. Microgravity induces pelvic bone loss through osteocloastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblastic cell cycle inhibition by CDKN1a/p21. ''PLoS ONE'' 8(4): e61372, 2013.</ref> This increase in osteoclasts activity has been seen particularly in the pelvic region, because this is the region which carries the biggest load with gravity present. A study demonstrated that in healthy mice, osteoclasts appearance increased by 197%, accompanied by a down-regulation of osteoblasts and growth factors that are known to help with the formation of new bone, after only sixteen days of exposure to microgravity. Elevated blood calcium levels from the lost bone result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation.<ref name=NASAbones /> It is still unknown whether bone recovers completely. Unlike people with osteoporosis, astronauts eventually regain their bone density.Citation needed|date=January 2010 After a 3–4 month trip into space, it takes about 2–3 years to regain lost bone density.Citation needed|date=January 2010 New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research on diet, exercise and medication may hold the potential to aid the process of growing new bone.

To prevent some of these adverse physiological effects, the ISS is equipped with two treadmills (including the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation System|COLBERT), and the aRED (advanced Resistive Exercise Device), which enable various weight-lifting exercises which add muscle but do nothing for bone density,<ref>cite journal |vauthors=Schneider SM, Amonette WE, Blazine K, Bentley J, Lee SM, Loehr JA, ((Moore AD Jr)), Rapley M, Mulder ER, Smith SM |date=November 2003 |title=Training with the International Space Station interim resistive exercise device. |journal=Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise|volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=1935–45 |pmid=14600562 |doi=10.1249/01.MSS.0000093611.88198.08</ref> and a stationary bicycle; each astronaut spends at least two hours per day exercising on the equipment.<ref name="ESALife">cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAH1V0VMOC_astronauts_0.html|publisher=ESA|accessdate=28 October 2009|date=19 July 2004|title=Daily life</ref><ref name="NASACrewEquip">cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/126_payload.html|title=Station Prepares for Expanding Crew|publisher=NASA|author=Cheryl L.

Fluid redistribution

Image:Clayton Anderson zero g.jpg|thumb|right|Astronaut Clayton Anderson observes as a water bubble floats in front of him on the Discovery. Water cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion plays a bigger role in microgravity than on Earth
The second effect of weightlessness takes place in human fluids. The body is made up of 60% water, much of it intra-vascular and inter-cellular. Within a few moments of entering a microgravity environment, fluid is immediately re-distributed to the upper body resulting in bulging neck veins, puffy face and sinus and nasal congestion which can last throughout the duration of the trip and is very much like the symptoms of the common cold. In space the autonomic reactions of the body to maintain blood pressure are not required and fluid is distributed more widely around the whole body. This results in a decrease in Blood plasma|plasma volume of around 20%. These fluid shifts initiate a cascade of adaptive systemic effects that can be dangerous upon return to earth. Orthostatic intolerance results in astronauts returning to Earth after extended space missions being unable to stand unassisted for more than 10 minutes at a time without fainting. This is due in part to changes in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and the loss of plasma volume. Although this effect becomes worse the longer the time spent in space, as yet all individuals have returned to normal within at most a few weeks of landing.Citation needed|date=February 2007

In space, astronauts lose fluid volume—including up to 22% of their blood volume. Because it has less blood to pump, the heart will atrophy. A weakened heart results in low blood pressure and can produce a problem with "orthostatic tolerance", or the body's ability to send enough oxygen to the brain without the astronaut's fainting or becoming dizzy. "Under the effects of the earth's gravity, blood and other body fluids are pulled towards the lower body. When gravity is taken away or reduced during space exploration, the blood tends to collect in the upper body instead, resulting in facial edema and other unwelcome side effects. Upon return to earth, the blood begins to pool in the lower extremities again, resulting in orthostatic hypotension."<ref>cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/25mar_dizzy.htm |title=When Space Makes You Dizzy |year=2002 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826230313/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/25mar_dizzy.htm |archivedate=2009-08-26 |df= </ref>

If indeed elevated intracranial pressure is the cause, artificial gravity might present one solution, as it would for many human health risks in space. However, such artificial gravitational systems have yet to be proven. More, even with sophisticated artificial gravity, a state of relative microgravity may remain, the risks of which remain unknown.

One effect of weightlessness on humans is that some astronauts report a change in their sense of taste when in space.<ref>cite web|title=NASAexplores 5–8: A Matter Of Taste|url=http://www.nasaexplores.com/show2_5_8a.php?id=03-038&gl=58|archive-url=https://archive.is/20080107131502/http://www.nasaexplores.com/show2_5_8a.php?id=03-038&gl=58|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 7, 2008|website=NASAexplores|publisher=NASAexplores|date=May 29, 2003</ref> Some astronauts find that their food is bland, others find that their favorite foods no longer taste as good (one who enjoyed coffee disliked the taste so much on a mission that he stopped drinking it after returning to Earth); some astronauts enjoy eating certain foods that they would not normally eat, and some experience no change whatsoever. Multiple tests have not identified the cause,<ref name=bourland20060407>cite interview | title=Charles T.

Astronauts often choose strong-tasting food to combat the loss of taste.

Psychological effects

=Research=
The psychological effects of living in space have not been clearly analyzed but analogies on Earth do exist, such as Arctic research stations and submarines. The enormous stress on the crew, coupled with the body adapting to other environmental changes, can result in anxiety, insomnia and depression.<ref name=Dickens-MR-2017-03>cite web|author=Dickens, Peter| date=March 2017|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2017/03/01/astronauts-at-work/ | title=Astronauts at Work: The Social Relations of Space Travel|publisher= ''Monthly Review''</ref>

=Stress=

There has been considerable evidence that psychosocial stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>cite book| author1 =Peter Suedfeld1| author2 = Kasia E. Wilk| author3 = Lindi Cassel| title = Flying with Strangers: Postmission Reflections of Multinational Space Crews</ref> Cosmonaut Valery Ryumin, twice Hero of the Soviet Union, quotes this passage from ''The Handbook of Hymen'' by O. Henry in his autobiographical book about the Salyut 6 mission: "If you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in a eighteen by twenty-foot cabin for a month. Human nature won't stand it."<ref>[http://epizodsspace.airbase.ru/bibl/ryumin/god/01.html Ryumin, Valery ''A Year off of Earth: A cosmonaut's journal.''] (In Russian). Moscow: Molodaya Gvardia Publishing, 1987. Retrieved 01.21.2013</ref>

NASA's interest in psychological stress caused by space travel, initially studied when their manned missions began, was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the Russian space station Mir. Common sources of stress in early American missions included maintaining high performance while under public scrutiny, as well as isolation from peers and family. On the ISS, the latter is still often a cause of stress, such as when NASA Astronaut Daniel Tani's mother died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.citation needed|date=January 2013

=Sleep=
Main|Sleep in space
The amount and quality of sleep experienced in space is poor due to highly variable light and dark cycles on flight decks and poor illumination during daytime hours in the space craft. Even the habit of looking out of the window before retiring can send the wrong messages to the brain, resulting in poor sleep patterns. These disturbances in circadian rhythm have profound effects on the neurobehavioural responses of crew and aggravate the psychological stresses they already experience (see Fatigue and sleep loss during spaceflight for more information). Sleep is disturbed on the ISS regularly due to mission demands, such as the scheduling of incoming or departing space vehicles. Sound levels in the station are unavoidably high because the atmosphere is unable to thermosiphon; fans are required at all times to allow processing of the atmosphere, which would stagnate in the freefall (zero-g) environment. Fifty percent of space shuttle astronauts take sleeping pills and still get 2 hours less sleep each night in space than they do on the ground. NASA is researching two areas which may provide the keys to a better night’s sleep, as improved sleep decreases fatigue and increases daytime productivity.  A variety of methods for combating this phenomenon are constantly under discussion.<ref>cite web|title=Wide Awake in Outer Space|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast04sep_1/|accessdate=9 September 2013</ref>

=Duration of space travel=

A study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks represent a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>cite journal |author1=Dietrich Manzey |author2=Bernd Lorenz |author3=Valeri Poljakov |year=1998 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537–559 |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |pmid=9557591</ref> While Skylab's three crews remained in space 1, 2, and 3 months respectively, long-term crews on Salyut 6, Salyut 7, and the ISS remain about 5–6 months, while MIR expeditions often lasted longer. The ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak different languages. First generation space stations had crews who spoke a single language, while 2nd and 3rd generation stations have a crew from many cultures who speak many languages. The ISS is unique because visitors are not classed automatically into 'host' or 'guest' categories as with previous stations and spacecraft, and may not suffer from feelings of isolation in the same way.

Future use
Image:Stanford torus under construction.jpg|thumb|right|Space colonization efforts must take into account the effects of space on the human body.
The sum of human experience has resulted in the accumulation of 58 solar years in space and a much better understanding of how the human body adapts. In the future, Space manufacturing|industrialisation of space and exploration of inner and outer planets will require humans to endure longer and longer periods in space. The majority of current data comes from missions of short duration and so some of the long-term physiological effects of living in space are still unknown. A round trip to Mars<ref name="WIRED-20140212" />  with current technology is estimated to involve at least 18 months in transit alone. Knowing how the human body reacts to such time periods in space is a vital part of the preparation for such journeys. On-board medical facilities need to be adequate for coping with any type of trauma or emergency as well as contain a huge variety of diagnostic and medical instruments in order to keep a crew healthy over a long period of time, as these will be the only facilities available on board a spacecraft for coping not only with trauma, but also with the adaptive responses of the human body in space.

At the moment only rigorously tested humans have experienced the conditions of space.  If Space colonization|off-world colonization someday begins, many types of people will be exposed to these dangers, and the effects on the very young are completely unknown. On October 29, 1998, John Glenn, one of the original Mercury 7, returned to space at the age of 77. His space flight, which lasted 9 days, provided NASA with important information about the effects of space flight in older people. Factors such as nutritional requirements and physical environments which have so far not been examined will become important. Overall, there is little data on the manifold effects of living in space, and this makes attempts toward mitigating the risks during a lengthy space habitation difficult. Test beds such as the ISS are currently being utilized to research some of these risks.

The environment of space is still largely unknown, and there will likely be as-yet-unknown hazards.  Meanwhile, future technologies such as artificial gravity and more complex bioregenerative life support systems may someday be capable of mitigating some risks.
