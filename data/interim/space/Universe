 Chronology and the Big Bang

The prevailing model for the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory.<ref>cite book|author=Joseph Silk|title=Horizons of Cosmology|publisher=Templeton Pressr|date=2009|page=208</ref><ref>cite book|author=Simon Singh|title=Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe|publisher=Harper Perennial|date=2005|page=560</ref> The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was an extremely hot and dense one, and that the Universe subsequently expanded and cooled. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.

The initial hot, dense state is called the Planck epoch, a brief period extending from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10<sup>−43</sup> seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, and gravity - currently the weakest by far of the fundamental interactions|four known forces - is believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been grand unification|unified. Since the Planck epoch, space has been metric expansion of space|expanding to its present scale, with a very short but intense period of cosmic inflation believed to have occurred within the first Scientific Notation|10<sup>−32</sup> seconds.<ref name=Sivaram>cite journal | author=C. Sivaram | journal=Astrophysics and Space Science | date=1986 | volume=125 | issue=1 | pages=189–99 | doi=10.1007/BF00643984 | bibcode=1986Ap&SS.125..189S | title= Evolution of the Universe through the Planck epoch</ref> This was a kind of expansion different from those we can see around us today. Objects in space did not physically move; instead the metric expansion of space|metric that defines space itself changed. Although objects in spacetime cannot move faster than the speed of light, this limitation does not apply to the metric governing spacetime itself. This initial period of inflation is believed to explain why space appears to be very flat, and much larger than light could travel since the start of the universe.

Within the first fraction of a second of the universe's existence, the four fundamental forces had separated. As the universe continued to cool down from its inconceivably hot state, various types of subatomic particles were able to form in short periods of time known as the quark epoch, the hadron epoch, and the lepton epoch. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. These elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations, including stable protons and neutrons, which then formed more complex atomic nuclei through nuclear fusion. This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, only lasted for about 17 minutes and ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred. About 25% of the protons and all the neutrons in the universe, by mass, were converted to helium, with small amounts of deuterium (a isotope|form of hydrogen) and traces of lithium. Any other chemical element|element was only formed in very tiny quantities. The other 75% of the protons remained unaffected, as hydrogen nuclei.

After nucleosynthesis ended, the universe entered a period known as the photon epoch. During this period, the Universe was still far too hot for matter to form neutral atoms, so it contained a hot, dense, foggy Plasma (physics)|plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. After about 377,000 years, the universe had cooled enough that electrons and nuclei could form the first stable atoms. This is known as recombination (cosmology)|recombination for historical reasons; in fact electrons and nuclei were combining for the first time. Unlike plasma, neutral atoms are Opacity (optics)|transparent to many wavelengths of light, so for the first time the universe also became transparent. The photons released ("photon decoupling|decoupled") when these atoms formed can still be seen today; they form the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

As the Universe expands, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. At around 47,000 years, the energy density of matter became larger than that of photons and neutrinos, and began to dominate the large scale behavior of the universe. This marked the end of the radiation-dominated era and the start of the matter-dominated era.

In the earliest stages of the universe, tiny fluctuations within the universe's density led to filament (cosmology)|concentrations of dark matter gradually forming. Ordinary matter, attracted to these by gravity, formed large gas clouds and eventually, stars and galaxies, where the dark matter was most dense, and void (cosmology)|voids where it was least dense. After around 100 - 300 million years,citation needed|date=May 2018 the first stars formed, known as Population III stars. These were probably very massive, luminous, metallicity|non metallic and short-lived. They were responsible for the gradual reionization of the Universe between about 200-500 million years and 1 billion years, and also for seeding the universe with elements heavier than helium, through stellar nucleosynthesis.<ref>cite news | work=Scientific American | title= The First Stars in the Universe |author1=Richard B.

After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era.<ref>Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33</ref> In this era, the expansion of the Universe is accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating due to dark energy.

Of the four fundamental interactions, gravitation is the dominant at astronomical length scales. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on astronomical length scales. The remaining two interactions, the weak nuclear force|weak and strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.

The size of the Universe is somewhat difficult to define. According to the general theory of relativity, far regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.<ref name="Kaku2008">cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ube-MQcFFZQC&pg=PA202|date=March 11, 2008|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-385-52544-2|pages=202–</ref>

Distant regions of space are assumed to exist and to be part of reality as much as we are, even though we can never interact with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still.

The more matter there is in the Universe, the stronger the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the Universe were ''too'' dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too ''little'' matter then the self-gravity would be too weak for astronomical structures, like galaxies or planets, to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Anthropic principle#Anthropic coincidences|Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has Critical Mass Density of the Universe|just the right mass-energy density, equivalent to about 5 protons per cubic meter, which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.<ref>cite AV media | author=Sean Carroll (physicist)|Sean Carroll and Michio Kaku | title=How the Universe Works 3 | volume=End of the Universe | date=2014 | publisher=Discovery Channel</ref>

There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, it was expected that the expansion rate would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe; and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter, which most cosmologists expected to be positive and related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be negative, approximately -0.55, which technically implies that the second derivative of the cosmic scale factor cosmology|scale factor <math> \ddot{a}</math> has been positive in the last 5-6 billion years.<ref name="nobel_2011" /><ref>cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=A 'Cosmic Jerk' That Reversed the Universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/11/us/a-cosmic-jerk-that-reversed-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 11, 2003</ref> This acceleration does not, however, imply that the Hubble parameter is currently increasing; see deceleration parameter for details.

Spacetimes are the arenas in which all physical events take place. The basic elements of spacetimes are event (relativity)|events. In any given spacetime, an event is defined as a unique position at a unique time.

Cosmologists often work with a given space-like slice of spacetime called the Comoving distance|comoving coordinates. The section of spacetime which can be observed is the backward light cone, which delimits the cosmological horizon.
The cosmological horizon (also called the particle horizon or the light horizon) is the maximum distance from which Elementary particle|particles can have traveled to the observation|observer in the age of the Universe.

Other than neutrinos, a form of hot dark matter, dark matter has not been detected directly, making it one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics.

Ordinary matter commonly exists in four state of matter|states (or phase (matter)|phases): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma (physics)|plasma. However, advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases, such as Bose–Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates.

</ref> For example, the proton is formed of two up quarks and one down quark; the neutron is formed of two down quarks and one up quark; and the electron is a kind of lepton. An atom consists of an atomic nucleus, made up of protons and neutrons, and electrons that orbit the nucleus. Because most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus, which is made up of baryons, astronomers often use the term ''baryonic matter'' to describe ordinary matter, although a small fraction of this "baryonic matter" is electrons.

Soon after the Big Bang, primordial protons and neutrons formed from the quark–gluon plasma of the early Universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in a process known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium, but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, carbon, was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of metallicity|heavier elements resulted from stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.<ref name=Clayton1983>cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Donald D.|title=Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis|date=1983|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10953-4|pages=362–435</ref>

 Hadrons 
Main|Hadron
A hadron is a composite particle made of quarks bound state|held together by the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one antiparticle|antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.
From approximately 10<sup>−6</sup> seconds after the Big Bang, during a period is known as the hadron epoch, the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the Universe was dominated by hadrons. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium. However, as the temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle annihilation reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.<ref name=Allday2002>cite book|last1=Allday|first1=Jonathan|title=Quarks, Leptons and the Big Bang|date=2002|publisher=IOP Publishing|isbn=978-0-7503-0806-9|edition=Second</ref>rp|244–66

The lepton epoch was the period in the evolution of the early Universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created.<ref>cite web|title=Thermal history of the Universe and early growth of density fluctuations|url=http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~gamk/TUM_Lectures/Lecture4.pdf|work=Guinevere Kauffmann|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics|accessdate=January 6, 2016</ref> Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons.

 Photons 
Main|Photon epoch
See also|Photino
A photon is the quantum of light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation. It is the force carrier for the electromagnetic force, even when Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|static via virtual photons. The effects of this force are easily observable at the microscopic scale|microscopic and at the macroscopic scale|macroscopic level because the photon has zero rest mass; this allows long distance fundamental interaction|interactions. Like all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by quantum mechanics and exhibit wave–particle duality, exhibiting properties of waves and of wikt:particle|particles.

The photon epoch started after most leptons and anti-leptons were annihilation|annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch, about 10 seconds after the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei were created in the process of nucleosynthesis which occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch. For the remainder of the photon epoch the Universe contained a hot dense plasma (physics)|plasma of nuclei, electrons and photons. About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms. As a result, photons no longer interacted frequently with matter and the Universe became transparent. The highly redshifted photons from this period form the cosmic microwave background. Tiny variations in temperature and density detectable in the CMB were the early "seeds" from which all subsequent structure formation took place.<ref name=Allday2002/>rp|244–66

 Cosmological models 
= Model of the Universe based on general relativity =
main|Solutions of the Einstein field equations
See also|Big Bang|Ultimate fate of the Universe
General relativity is the Differential geometry|geometric Theoretical physics|theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics. It is the basis of current Physical cosmology|cosmological models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and Time in physics|time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.<ref name="zeilik_cosmology" />

With the assumption of the cosmological principle that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, a specific solution of the field equations that describes the Universe is the metric tensor called the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric,
:<math>
ds^2 = -c^{2} dt^2 +
R(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2 \right)
</math>
where (''r'', θ, φ) correspond to a spherical coordinate system. This metric (mathematics)|metric has only two undetermined parameters. An overall dimensionless length scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor ''R'' describes the size scale of the Universe as a function of time; an increase in ''R'' is the expansion of the Universe.<ref>harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=12</ref> A curvature index ''k'' describes the geometry. The index ''k'' is defined so that it can take only one of three values: 0, corresponding to flat Euclidean geometry; 1, corresponding to a space of positive curvature; or −1, corresponding to a space of positive or negative curvature.<ref name="RaineThomas66" /> The value of ''R'' as a function of time ''t'' depends upon ''k'' and the cosmological constant ''Λ''.<ref name="zeilik_cosmology">cite book |title=Introductory Astronomy & Astrophysics |last1=Zeilik |first1=Michael |last2=Gregory |first2=Stephen A. |date=1998 |edition=4th |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-006228-5 | section=25-2</ref> The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy.<ref name="peebles" /> The equation describing how ''R'' varies with time is known as the Friedmann equation after its inventor, Alexander Friedmann.<ref>cite journal|author = Friedmann A.|date = 1922|title = Über die Krümmung des Raumes|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 377–86|doi = 10.1007/BF01332580|bibcode = 1922ZPhy...10..377F|authorlink = Alexander Friedmann|url=http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/16735/E001554876.pdf</ref>

The solutions for ''R(t)'' depend on ''k'' and ''Λ'', but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale ''R'' of the Universe can remain constant ''only'' if the Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (''k''=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein.<ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /> However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe is known to be inhomogeneous on smaller scales, ''R'' must change over time. When ''R'' changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light-years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago<ref>cite web

</ref> and never moved faster than the speed of light.

Second, all solutions suggest that there was a gravitational singularity in the past, when ''R'' went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because it is based on the questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, ''R'' grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when ''R'' had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity, which has not yet been formulated.<ref>harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|pp=122–23</ref>

Third, the curvature index ''k'' determines the sign of the mean spatial curvature of spacetime<ref name="RaineThomas66">harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=66</ref> averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light-years). If ''k''=1, the curvature is positive and the Universe has a finite volume.<ref name="RaineThomas70" /> A Universe with positive curvature is often visualized as a 3-sphere|three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if ''k'' is zero or negative, the Universe has an infinite volume.<ref name="RaineThomas70">harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=70</ref> It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when ''R''=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when ''k'' does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions.

The ultimate fate of the Universe is still unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index ''k'' and the cosmological constant ''Λ''. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, ''k'' would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch,<ref>harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=84</ref> possibly starting a new Universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, ''k'' would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Future of an expanding universe|Big Freeze and the heat death of the Universe.<ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /> Modern data suggests that the rate of expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (''k'' = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.<ref>harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|pp=88, 110–13</ref>

The pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic Greek philosophers and Indian philosophers developed some of the earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe.<ref name=Routledge/><ref>cite book|title=The Unfinished Universe|page=21|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=Louise|last=B. Young</ref> The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or ''arche''. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be Water (classical element)|water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless ''Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron''. Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be Air (classical element)|air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the ''arche'' to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of ''Nous'' (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (classical element)|fire (and spoke of ''logos''). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through a void (astronomy)|void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers Drag (physics)|resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.<ref name=Routledge/>

Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change, his contemporary Parmenides made the radical suggestion that all change is an illusion, that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature. Parmenides denoted this reality as lang|grc|τὸ ἐν (The One). Parmenides' idea seemed implausible to many Greeks, but his student Zeno of Elea challenged them with several famous Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes. Aristotle responded to these paradoxes by developing the notion of a potential countable infinity, as well as the infinitely divisible continuum. Unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles of time, he believed that the world is bounded by the celestial spheres and that cumulative stellar magnitude is only finitely multiplicative.

The Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika school, developed a notion of atomism and proposed that light and heat were varieties of the same substance.<ref>Will Durant, ''Our Oriental Heritage'': quote|"Two systems of Hindu thought propound physical theories suggestively similar to those of Ancient Greece|Greece.

(1930, 1962), ''Buddhist Logic'', Volume 1, p. 19, Dover, New York: quote|"The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether.

Both systems <nowiki>[</nowiki>Samkhya|Sānkhya, and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called "qualities" (''guna-dharma'') in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality,... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in Sānkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called ''guna'', "quality", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called ''dharmas'' ('qualities')."</ref>

Astronomical models of the Universe were proposed soon after astronomy began with the Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers, who viewed the Universe as a Flat Earth|flat disk floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps like those of Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus.

Later Ancient Greece|Greek philosophers, observing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were concerned with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on empirical evidence. The first coherent model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, celestial spheres eternally uniform circular motion|rotate with uniform motion around a stationary Earth. Normal classical elements|matter is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.

''De Mundo'' (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC), stated, "Five elements, situated in spheres in five regions, the less being in each case surrounded by the greater—namely, earth surrounded by water, water by air, air by fire, and fire by ether—make up the whole Universe".<ref name=1908DeMundo>cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/demundoarisrich|title=De Mundo|year=1914|author=Aristotle; Forster, E. S. (Edward Seymour), 1879–1950; Dobson, J. F. (John Frederic), 1875–1947|page=2|publisher=Oxford : The Clarendon Press</ref>

This model was also refined by Callippus and after concentric spheres were abandoned, it was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations by Ptolemy. The success of such a model is largely due to the mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) can be decomposed into a set of circular functions (the Fourier series|Fourier modes). Other Greek scientists, such as the Pythagoreans|Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus, postulated (according to Stobaeus account) that at the center of the Universe was a "central fire" around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion.<ref>Boyer, C. (1968) [https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfMathematics ''A History of Mathematics'']. Wiley, p. 54.</ref>

The Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first known individual to propose a Heliocentrism|heliocentric model of the Universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book ''The Sand Reckoner'' describes Aristarchus's heliocentric model. Archimedes wrote:

<blockquote>You, King Gelon, are aware the Universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the Universe is many times greater than the Universe just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface</blockquote>

Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why stellar parallax had not been observed, that is, the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, was assumed to be an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests (''On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon''):

<blockquote>Cleanthes [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the Stoics] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe [i.e. the Earth], ... supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the Earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis</blockquote>

File:ThomasDiggesmap.JPG|thumb|left|Copernican heliocentrism|Model of the Copernican Universe by Thomas Digges in 1576, with the amendment that the stars are no longer confined to a sphere, but spread uniformly throughout the space surrounding the planets.

The Aristotelian model was accepted in the Western world for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the Earth rotated on its axis and if the Sun were placed at the center of the Universe.

In 1919, when Hooker Telescope was completed, the prevailing view still was that the Universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, Edwin Hubble identified Cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum Nebula|Triangulum among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that Universe consists of multitude of galaxies.<ref name="SharovNovikov1993">cite book|last1=Sharov|first1=Aleksandr Sergeevich|last2=Novikov|first2=Igor Dmitrievich|title=Edwin Hubble, the discoverer of the big bang universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttEwkEdPc70C&pg=PA34|accessdate=December 31, 2011|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-41617-7|page=34</ref>

The modern era of physical cosmology began in 1917, when Albert Einstein first applied his general theory of relativity to model the structure and dynamics of the Universe.<ref name="einstein_1917">cite journal|last = Einstein|first = A|authorlink = Albert Einstein|date = 1917|title = Kosmologische Betrachtungen zur allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie|series = 1917|journal = Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Sitzungsberichte|volume = (part 1)|pages = 142–52</ref>
