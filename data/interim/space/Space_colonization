Space colonization (also called space settlement, or extraterrestrial colonization) is permanent human habitation off the planet Earth.

Many arguments have been made for and against space colonization.<ref>For example, [http://www.thespaceshow.com The Space Show], an online radio program, has had on average 16 shows per month going back to 2001, many of which discuss space settlement.</ref> The two most common in favor of colonization are survival of human civilization and the biosphere in the event of a Global catastrophic risk|planetary-scale disaster (natural or man-made), and the availability of additional resources in space that could enable expansion of human society. The most common objections to colonization include concerns that the commodification of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and military institutions, and to exacerbate pre-existing detrimental processes such as wars, economic inequality, and environmental degradation.<ref name=Dickens-MR-2010-11>cite book| last1 = Dickens| first1=Peter|last2=Ormrod|first2=James| url=http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end/ |title=The Humanization of the Cosmos - to What End?|date=Nov 2010|publisher=Monthly Review</ref><ref name=Dickens-MR-2008-02>Dickens, Peter (Feb 2008).

No space colonies have been built so far. Currently, the building of a space colony would present a set of huge technological and economic challenges. Space settlements would have to provide for nearly all (or all) the material needs of hundreds or thousands of humans, in an environment out in space that is Effect of spaceflight on the human body|very hostile to human life. They would involve technologies, such as controlled ecological life support systems, that have yet to be developed in any meaningful way. They would also have to deal with the as-yet unknown issue of how humans would behave and thrive in such places long-term. Because of the present cost of sending anything from the surface of the Earth into orbit (around $2,500 per-pound to orbit, expected to further decrease),<ref>cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space/is-spacex-changing-the-rocket-equation-132285884/?no-ist|title=Is SpaceX Changing the Rocket Equation?|author=Andrew Chaikin|work=Air & Space Magazine|accessdate=4 June 2015</ref> a space colony would currently be a massively expensive project.

There are yet no plans for building space colonies by any large-scale organization, either government or private. However, many proposals, speculations, and designs for space settlements have been made through the years, and a considerable number of space colonization space advocacy|advocates and groups are active. Several famous scientists, such as Freeman Dyson, have come out in favor of space settlement.<ref name=dyson>cite web |author=Britt, Robert Roy |date=8 October 2001 |title=Stephen Hawking: Humanity Must Colonize Space to Survive |website=space.com |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/colonize_why_011008-1.html |accessdate=2006-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125083046/http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/colonize_why_011008-1.html |archivedate=25 November 2010 |df= .</ref>

On the technological front, there is ongoing progress in making access to space cheaper (reusable launch systems could reach $10 per-pound to orbit),<ref>cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a7446/elon-musk-on-spacexs-reusable-rocket-plans-6653023/|title=Elon Musk on SpaceX's Reusable Rocket Plans|date=7 February 2012|publisher=</ref> and in creating Space manufacturing|automated manufacturing and construction techniques.<ref>cite news |last=Anthony|first=Sebastian |title=Space giants join forces to battle SpaceX: This is how cheap space travel begins |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/184434-space-giants-join-forces-to-battle-spacex-this-is-how-cheap-space-travel-begins |accessdate=2014-10-10 |newspaper=NASAspaceflight.com |date=2014-06-16 </ref>

Reasons

=Survival of human civilization=
Main|Space and survival

The primary argument calling for space colonization is the long-term survival of human civilization. By developing alternative locations off Earth, the planet's species, including humans, could live on in the event of Global catastrophic risk|natural or man-made disasters on our own planet.<ref>cite book | last = Kaku | first = Michio | author-link = Michio Kaku | title = The Future of Humanity: Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth | publisher = Doubleday, a division of Penguin Random House | year = 2018 | pages = 3–6 | isbn = 9780385542760 | quote = It is as inescapable as the laws of physics that humanity will one day confront some type of extinction-level Extinction event|event. . . .

On two occasions, theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking has argued for space colonization as a means of saving humanity. In 2001, Hawking predicted that the human race would become extinct within the next thousand years, unless colonies could be established in space.<ref>cite news |last=Highfield |first=Roger |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1359562/Colonies-in-space-may-be-only-hope-says-Hawking.html |title=Colonies in space may be only hope, says Hawking |work=The Telegraph |date=16 October 2001 |accessdate=5 August 2012</ref> In 2006, he stated that humanity faces two options: either we colonize space within the next two hundred years and build residential units on other planets, or we will face the prospect of Human extinction|long-term extinction.<ref>"Mankind must colonize other planets to survive, says Hawking". Daily Mail(London). 2006-12-01. Retrieved March 11, 2013</ref>

In 2005, then NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin|Michael Griffin identified space colonization as the ultimate goal of current spaceflight programs, saying:
quote|...&nbsp;the goal isn't just scientific exploration&nbsp;... it's also about extending the range of human habitat out from Earth into the solar system as we go forward in time&nbsp;... In the long run a single-planet species will not survive&nbsp;... If we humans want to survive for hundreds of thousands or millions of years, we must ultimately populate other planets. Now, today the technology is such that this is barely conceivable. We're in the infancy of it.&nbsp;... I'm talking about that one day, I don't know when that day is, but there will be more human beings who live off the Earth than on it. We may well have people living on the Moon. We may have people living on the moons of Jupiter and other planets. We may have people making habitats on asteroids&nbsp;... I know that humans will colonize the solar system and one day go beyond.<ref>Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/23/AR2005092301691.html| title=NASA's Griffin: 'Humans Will Colonize the Solar System'|date=September 25, 2005| publisher=Washington Post| pages=B07</ref>

Louis J. Halle, formerly of the United States Department of State, wrote in ''Foreign Affairs'' (Summer 1980) that the colonization of space will protect humanity in the event of global nuclear warfare.<ref>Cite journal| url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800601faessay8146/louis-j-halle/a-hopeful-future-for-mankind.html| title=A Hopeful Future for Mankind| first=Louis J.| last=Halle| journal=Foreign Affairs| date=Summer 1980| doi=10.2307/20040585| volume=58| issue=5| pages=1129–1136| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013051342/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800601faessay8146/louis-j-halle/a-hopeful-future-for-mankind.html| archivedate=2004-10-13| df=| jstor=20040585</ref> The physicist Paul Davies also supports the view that if a planetary catastrophe threatens the survival of the human species on Earth, a self-sufficient colony could "reverse-colonize" Earth and restore Civilization|human civilization. The author and journalist William E. Burrows and the biochemist Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro proposed a private project, the Alliance to Rescue Civilization, with the goal of establishing an off-Earth "backup" of human civilization.<ref>

Based on his Copernican principle, J. Richard Gott has estimated that the human race could survive for another 7.8 million years, but it is not likely to ever colonize other planets. However, he expressed a hope to be proven wrong, because "colonizing other worlds is our best chance to hedge our bets and improve the survival prospects of our species".<ref>Cite news|last=Tierney |first=John |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/science/17tier.html?ex=1342324800&en=ccf375ae9f268470&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |title=A Survival Imperative for Space Colonization |date=July 17, 2007 |work=The New York Times</ref>

=Vast resources in space=
See also | Steady-state economy #Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space 
Resources in space, both in materials and energy, are enormous. The Solar System alone has, according to different estimates, enough material and energy to support anywhere from several thousand to over a billion times that of the current Earth-based human population.<ref>Estimated 3000 times the land area of Earth.

Asteroid mining will also be a key player in space colonization. Water and materials to make structures and shielding can be easily found in asteroids. Instead of resupplying on Earth, mining and fuel stations need to be established on asteroids to facilitate better space travel.<ref>[https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2017_Phase_I_Phase_II/Sustainable_Human_Exploration Optical Mining of Asteroids, Moons, and Planets to Enable Sustainable Human Exploration and Space Industrialization]; April 6, 2017; NASA</ref> Optical mining is the term NASA uses to describe extracting materials from asteroids.

=Expansion with fewer negative consequences=
Further|Holocene extinction

Expansion of humans and technological progress has usually resulted in some form of environmental devastation, and destruction of ecosystems and their accompanying wildlife. In the past, expansion has often come at the expense of displacing many indigenous peoples, the resulting treatment of these peoples ranging anywhere from encroachment to genocide. Because space has no known life, this need not be a consequence, as some space settlement advocates have pointed out.<ref>Cite news| url=http://www.space-settlement-institute.org/meaning.html| title=The Meaning of Space Settlement| publisher = Space Settlement Institute| accessdate=5 September 2014</ref><ref>Savage, Marshall (1992, 1994).

=Alleviating overpopulation and resource demand=
See also|Human overpopulation #Extraterrestrial settlement
Another argument for space colonization is to mitigate the negative effects of Human overpopulation|overpopulation.<ref>Cite journal|date=1976-01-01|title=The impact of space colonization on world dynamics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040162576900196|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=361–399|doi=10.1016/0040-1625(76)90019-6|issn=0040-1625|last1=Vajk|first1=J.Peter</ref>clarify|date=February 2016<!-- Is this to mitigate "negative effects" for some group of persons who settle off Earth, or to generally mitigate a perceived overpopulation problem on Earth? Looking for sources on the latter argument, if it is being made. -->
If the resources of space were opened to use and viable life-supporting habitats were built, Earth would no longer define the limitations of growth. Although many of Earth's resources are non-renewable, off-planet colonies could satisfy the majority of the planet's resource requirements. With the availability of extraterrestrial resources, demand on terrestrial ones would decline.<ref>O'Neill, ''Colonies in Space''; Pournelle, ''A Step Farther Out''.</ref>

=Other arguments=
Additional goals cite the innate human drive to explore and discover, a quality recognized at the core of progress and thriving civilizations.<ref>cite book |author= Clarke, Arthur C. |title= Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry Into the Limits of the Possible |year= 1962 |chapter= Rocket to the Renaissance</ref><ref>cite web | url= http://www.spacedaily.com/news/oped-03y.html | title= The Space Settlement Summit | author= McKnight, John Carter | publisher= Space Daily | date= 20 March 2003</ref>

Nick Bostrom has argued that from a utilitarianism|utilitarian perspective, space colonization should be a chief goal as it would enable a very large population to live for a very long period of time (possibly billions of years), which would produce an enormous amount of utility (or happiness).<ref>cite journal |url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html |title= Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological Development |journal= Utilitas |volume= 15 |number= 3 |date= November 2003 |pages= 308–314 | doi= 10.1017/S0953820800004076|last1= Bostrom |first1= Nick |citeseerx= 10.1.1.429.2849 </ref> He claims that it is more important to reduce existential risks to increase the probability of eventual colonization than to accelerate technological development so that space colonization could happen sooner. In his paper, he assumes that the created lives will have positive ethical value despite the problem of suffering.

In a 2001 interview with Freeman Dyson, J.&nbsp;Richard Gott and Sid Goldstein, they were asked for reasons why some humans should live in space.<ref name=dyson /> Their answers were:
* Spread life and beauty throughout the universe
* Ensure the survival of our species
* Make money through new forms of Commercialization of space|space commercialization such as space-based solar power|solar-power satellites, asteroid mining, and space manufacturing
* Save the environment (biophysical)|environment of Earth by moving people and industry into space

Goals

Although some items of the infrastructure requirements above can already be easily produced on Earth and would therefore not be very valuable as trade items (oxygen, water, base metal ores, silicates, etc.), other high value items are more abundant, more easily produced, of higher quality, or can only be produced in space. These would provide (over the long-term) a very high return on the initial investment in space infrastructure.<ref>[http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/the_technical_and_economic_feasibility_of_mining_the_near_earth_asteriods.shtml The Technical and Economic Feasibility of Mining the Near-Earth Asteroids] Presented at 49th IAF Congress, Sept 28 – Oct 2, 1998, Melbourne, Australia by Mark J Sonter&nbsp;— Space Future</ref>

The mining and extraction of metals from a small asteroid the size of 3554 Amun or (6178) 1986 DA, both small near-Earth asteroids, would be 30 times as much metal as humans have mined throughout history. A metal asteroid this size would be worth approximately US$20 trillion at 2001 market prices.

Space colonization is seen as a long-term goal of some national space programs. Since the advent of the 21st-century commercialization of space, which saw greater cooperation between NASA and the private sector, several private companies have announced plans toward the colonization of Mars. Among entrepreneurs leading the call for space colonization are Elon Musk, Dennis Tito and Bas Lansdorp.<ref>[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4729211/Billionaire-PayPal-founder-announces-Mars-city-bid.html Billionaire PayPal founder announces dramatic Mars city bid], by Jack Losh; The Sun, January 6, 2013</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/business/global/reality-tv-for-the-red-planet.html Reality TV for the Red Planet], by Nicola Clark; The New York Times, March 8, 2013</ref><ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/02/130222-manned-mission-mars-tito-space-science/ Businessman Dennis Tito Financing Manned Mission to Mars], by Jane J.

Method
Building colonies in space would require access to water, food, space, people, construction materials, energy, transportation, communications, life support system|life support, simulated gravity, radiation protection and capital investment. It is likely the colonies would be located near the necessary physical resources. The practice of space architecture seeks to transform spaceflight from a heroic test of human endurance to a normality within the bounds of comfortable experience. As is true of other frontier-opening endeavors, the capital investment necessary for space colonization would probably come from governments,<ref>cite journal|url=http://www.jetpress.org/volume4/space.htm |title=The Political Economy of Very Large Space Projects |author=John Hickman |journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology |volume=4 |date=November 1999 |accessdate=2013-12-14 |issn=1541-0099</ref> an argument made by John Hickman<ref>John Hickman. 2010.

=Materials=
Further|Asteroid mining

Colonies on the Moon, Mars, or asteroids could extract local materials. The Moon is deficient in volatiles such as argon, helium and compounds of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen. The LCROSS impacter was targeted at the Cabeus crater which was chosen as having a high concentration of water for the Moon. A plume of material erupted in which some water was detected. Mission chief scientist Anthony Colaprete estimated that the Cabeus crater contains material with 1% water or possibly more.<ref>Cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/NASA-s-moon-blast-called-a-smashing-success-3213973.php | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=David | last=Perlman | title=NASA's moon blast called a smashing success | date=2009-10-10</ref> Water ice should also be in other permanently shadowed craters near the lunar poles. Although helium is present only in low concentrations on the Moon, where it is deposited into regolith by the solar wind, an estimated million tons of He-3 exists over all.<ref>[http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4588/ ] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308151604/http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4588/ |date=March 8, 2012 </ref> It also has industrially significant oxygen, silicon, and metals such as iron, aluminum, and titanium.

Launching materials from Earth is expensive, so bulk materials for colonies could come from the Moon, a near-Earth object (NEO), Phobos (moon)|Phobos, or Deimos (moon)|Deimos. The benefits of using such sources include: a lower gravitational force, no Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag on cargo vessels, and no biosphere to damage. Many NEOs contain substantial amounts of metals. Underneath a drier outer crust (much like oil shale), some other NEOs are inactive comets which include billions of tons of water ice and kerogen hydrocarbons, as well as some nitrogen compounds.<ref>cite conference |title=Discovery of Abundant, Accessible Hydrocarbons nearly Everywhere in the Solar System |last1= Zuppero|first1= Anthony |year= 1996 |publisher= American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE |booktitle= Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Space '96 |doi= 10.1061/40177(207)107|isbn= 0-7844-0177-2</ref>

Recycling of some raw materials would almost certainly be necessary.

=Energy=
Solar energy in orbit is abundant, reliable, and is commonly used to power satellites today. There is no night in free space, and no clouds or atmosphere to block sunlight. Light intensity obeys an inverse-square law. So the solar energy available at distance ''d'' from the Sun is ''E'' = 1367/''d''<sup>2</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>, where ''d'' is measured in astronomical units (AU) and 1367 watts/m<sup>2</sup> is the energy available at the distance of Earth's orbit from the Sun, 1 AU.<ref>McGRAW-HILL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF Science & Technology, 8th Edition (c)1997; vol. 16 page 654</ref>

In the weightlessness and vacuum of space, high temperatures for industrial processes can easily be achieved in solar ovens with huge parabolic reflectors made of metallic foil with very lightweight support structures. Flat mirrors to reflect sunlight around radiation shields into living areas (to avoid line-of-sight access for cosmic rays, or to make the Sun's image appear to move across their "sky") or onto crops are even lighter and easier to build.

Large solar power photovoltaic cell arrays or thermal power plants would be needed to meet the electrical power needs of the settlers' use. In developed parts of Earth, electrical consumption can average 1 kilowatt/person (or roughly 10 watt-hour|megawatt-hours per person per year.)<ref>[http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm UNESCAP Electric Power in Asia and the Pacific] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213083253/http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm |date=February 13, 2011 </ref> These power plants could be at a short distance from the main structures if wires are used to transmit the power, or much farther away with wireless power transmission.

A major export of the initial space settlement designs was anticipated to be large solar power satellites that would use wireless power transmission (phase-locked microwave beams or lasers emitting wavelengths that special solar cells convert with high efficiency) to send power to locations on Earth, or to colonies on the Moon or other locations in space. For locations on Earth, this method of getting power is extremely benign, with zero emissions and far less ground area required per watt than for conventional solar panels. Once these satellites are primarily built from lunar or asteroid-derived materials, the price of SPS electricity could be lower than energy from fossil fuel or nuclear energy; replacing these would have significant benefits such as the elimination of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste from electricity generation.

Transmitting solar energy wirelessly from the Earth to the Moon and back is also an idea proposed for the benefit of space colonization and energy resources. Physicist Dr. David Criswell, who worked for NASA during the Apollo missions, came up with the idea of using power beams to transfer energy from space. These beams, microwaves with a wavelength of about 12&nbsp;cm, will be almost untouched as they travel through the atmosphere. They can also be aimed at more industrial areas to keep away from humans or animal activities.<ref name="i2massociates.com">[http://www.i2massociates.com/downloads/AAPG_Memoir_101-July18-2012.pdf Nuclear Power and Associated Environmental Issues in the Transition of Exploration and Mining on Earth to the Development of Off-World Natural Resources in the 21st Century]</ref> This will allow for safer and more reliable methods of transferring solar energy.

In 2008, scientists were able to send a 20 watt microwave signal from a mountain in Maui to the island of Hawaii. Since then JAXA and Mitsubishi has teamed up on a $21 billion project in order to place satellites in orbit which could generate up to 1 gigawatt of energy.<ref>[http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-06/satellites-could-gather-energy-sun-and-beam-it-down-earth Space Based Solar Power],<!--Author?--> ''Popular Science'', June 2, 2011.page needed|date=September 2017</ref> These are the next advancements being done today in order to make energy be transmitted wirelessly for space-based solar energy.

However, the value of SPS power delivered wirelessly to other locations in space will typically be far higher than to Earth. Otherwise, the means of generating the power would need to be included with these projects and pay the heavy penalty of Earth launch costs. Therefore, other than proposed demonstration projects for power delivered to Earth,<ref name="NatSecSpaceOffice2007"/> the first priority for SPS electricity is likely to be locations in space, such as communications satellites, fuel depots or "orbital tugboat" boosters transferring cargo and passengers between low-Earth orbit (LEO) and other orbits such as geosynchronous orbit (GEO), lunar orbit or highly-eccentric Earth orbit (HEEO).<ref name="Lewis1997">Mining the Sky</ref>rp|132 The system will also rely on satellites and receiving stations on Earth to convert the energy into electricity. Because of this energy can be transmitted easily from dayside to nightside meaning power is reliable 24/7.<ref>[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/moon-solar-energy-power Beaming solar energy from the Moon could solve Earth's energy crisis]; March 29, 2017; WIRED]</ref>

Nuclear power is sometimes proposed for colonies located on the Moon or on Mars, as the supply of solar energy is too discontinuous in these locations; the Moon has nights of two Earth weeks in duration. Mars has nights, relatively high gravity, and an atmosphere featuring Climate of Mars#Effect of dust storms|large dust storms to cover and degrade solar panels. Also, Mars' greater distance from the Sun (1.5 astronomical units, AU) translates into ''E/(1.5<sup>2</sup> = 2.25)'' only ½–⅔ the solar energy of Earth orbit.<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091004020806.htm 'Trash Can' Nuclear Reactors Could Power Human Outpost On Moon Or Mars]; October 4, 2009; ScienceDaily</ref> Another method would be transmitting energy wirelessly to the lunar or Martian colonies from solar power satellites (SPSs) as described above; the difficulties of generating power in these locations make the relative advantages of SPSs much greater there than for power beamed to locations on Earth. In order to also be able to fulfill the requirements of a moon base and energy to supply life support, maintenance, communications, and research, a combination of both nuclear and solar energy will be used in the first colonies.<ref name="i2massociates.com"/>

For both solar thermal and nuclear power generation in airless environments, such as the Moon and space, and to a lesser extent the very thin Martian atmosphere, one of the main difficulties is dispersing the Carnot cycle|inevitable heat generated. This requires fairly large radiator areas.

=Life support=
Further|Effect of spaceflight on the human body|Space medicine|Space food

In space settlements, a life support system must recycle or import all the nutrients without "crashing." The closest terrestrial analogue to space life support is possibly that of a nuclear submarine. Nuclear submarines use mechanical life support systems to support humans for months without surfacing, and this same basic technology could presumably be employed for space use. However, nuclear submarines run "open loop"—extracting oxygen from seawater, and typically dumping carbon dioxide overboard, although they recycle existing oxygen.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.airitilibrary.com.libproxy1.usc.edu/Publication/alDetailedMesh?DocID=P20100106003-200911-201004190023-201004190023-1642-1650|title=A Novel Application of the SAWD-Sabatier-SPE Integrated System for CO2 Removal and O2 Regeneration in Submarine Cabins during Prolonged Voyages|last=Huang|first=Zhi|date=|website=Airiti Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 September 2018</ref> Recycling of the carbon dioxide has been approached in the literature using the Sabatier process or the Bosch reaction.

Although a fully mechanistic life support system is conceivable, a closed ecological system is generally proposed for life support. The Biosphere 2 project in Arizona has shown that a complex, small, enclosed, man-made biosphere can support eight people for at least a year, although there were many problems. A year or so into the two-year mission oxygen had to be replenished, which strongly suggests that they achieved atmospheric closure.

The relationship between organisms, their habitat and the non-Earth environment can be:
* Organisms and their habitat fully isolated from the environment (examples include artificial biosphere, Biosphere 2, life support system)
* Changing the environment to become a life-friendly habitat, a process called terraforming
* Changing organisms to become more compatible with the environment (see genetic engineering, transhumanism, cyborg)

A combination of the above technologies is also possible.

To protect life, settlements must be surrounded by sufficient mass to absorb most incoming radiation, unless magnetic or plasma radiation shields were developed.<ref name = spacecraftshielding>[http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~simon_g_shepherd/research/Shielding/ Spacecraft Shielding] engineering.dartmouth.edu.

Space manufacturing could enable self-replication. Some think it's the ultimate goal because it allows an exponential growth|exponential increase in colonies, while eliminating costs to and dependence on Earth.<ref>Ian Crawford, "Where are they?," ''Scientific American'' 283, no. 1 (2000 July): 38.</ref> It could be argued that the establishment of such a colony would be Earth's first act of self-replication.<ref>Lynn Margulis and Ricardo Guerrero, "Life as a planetary phenomenon: the colonization of Mars," ''Microbiología'' 11 (1995): 173–84.</ref> Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as integrated circuits, medicines, DNA|genetic material and tools.

=Psychological adjustment=
The monotony and loneliness that comes from a prolonged space mission can leave astronauts susceptible to cabin fever or having a psychotic break. Moreover, lack of sleep, fatigue, and work overload can affect an astronaut's ability to perform well in an environment such as space where every action is critical.<ref>Clynes, Manfred E. and Nathan S. Kline, (1960) "Cyborgs and Space," Astronautics, September, pp.&nbsp;26–27 and 74–76;</ref>

=Population size=
In 2002, the Anthropology|anthropologist John H. Moore [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1936-magic-number-for-space-pioneers-calculated. estimated] that a population of 150–180 would permit a stable society to exist for 60 to 80 generations&nbsp;— equivalent to 2000 years.

A much smaller initial population of as little as two women should be viable as long as human embryos are available from Earth. Use of a sperm bank from Earth also allows a smaller starting base with negligible inbreeding.

Researchers in conservation biology have tended to adopt the "50/500" rule of thumb initially advanced by Franklin and Soule. This rule says a short-term effective population size (''N''<sub>e</sub>) of 50 is needed to prevent an unacceptable rate of breed|inbreeding, whereas a long‐term ''N''<sub>e</sub> of 500 is required to maintain overall genetic variability. The ''N''<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50 prescription corresponds to an inbreeding rate of 1% per generation, approximately half the maximum rate tolerated by domestic animal breeders. The ''N''<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;500 value attempts to balance the rate of gain in genetic variation due to mutation with the rate of loss due to genetic drift.

Assuming a journey of 6,300 years, the astrophysicist Frédéric Marin and the particle physicist Camille Beluffi calculated that the minimum viable population for a generation ship to reach Proxima Centauri would be 98 settlers at the beginning of the mission (then the crew will breed until reaching a stable population of several hundred settlers within the ship) .<ref>cite journal |arxiv=1806.03856|last1=Marin|first1=F|title=Computing the minimal crew for a multi-generational space travel towards Proxima Centauri b|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=71|pages=45|last2=Beluffi|first2=C|year=2018|bibcode=2018JBIS...71...45M</ref><ref>cite news |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611485/this-is-how-many-people-wed-have-to-send-to-proxima-centauri-to-make-sure-someone-actually/amp/ |publisher=''MIT Technology Review'' |title=This is how many people we’d have to send to Proxima Centauri to make sure someone actually arrives |date=June 22, 2018 |quote=“We can then conclude that, under the parameters used for those simulations, a minimum crew of 98 settlers is needed for a 6,300-year multi-generational space journey towards Proxima Centauri b,” say Marin and Beluffi.</ref>

Location

Location is a frequent point of contention between space colonization advocates. The location of colonization can be on a physical body planet, dwarf planet, natural satellite, or asteroid or orbiting one. For colonies not on a body see also space habitat.

=Near-Earth space=

The Moon
Main|Colonization of the Moon
Due to its proximity and familiarity, Earth's Moon is discussed as a target for colonization. It has the benefits of proximity to Earth and lower escape velocity, allowing for easier exchange of goods and services. A drawback of the Moon is its low abundance of volatiles necessary for life such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. Water-ice deposits that exist in some polar Impact crater|craters could serve as a source for these elements. An alternative solution is to bring hydrogen from near-Earth asteroids and combine it with oxygen extracted from lunar rock.

The Moon's low surface gravity is also a concern, as it is unknown whether 1/6g-force|g is enough to maintain human health for long periods.citation needed|date=February 2017 <!--add, or link to, something about zero-gee bone decay and the like-->

The Moon's lack of atmosphere provides no protection from space radiation or meteoroids. The early Moon colonies may shelter in ancient Lunar lava tubes to gain protection. The two-week day/night cycle makes use of solar power more difficult.

Lagrange points
Main|Lagrange point colonization
File:Lagrange points.jpg|thumb|A contour plot of the gravitational potential of the Sun and Earth, showing the five Earth–Sun Lagrange points

Another near-Earth possibility are the five Earth–Moon Lagrangian point|Lagrange points. Although they would generally also take a few days to reach with current technology, many of these points would have near-continuous solar power because their distance from Earth would result in only brief and infrequent eclipses of light from the Sun. However, the fact that the  Earth–Moon Lagrange points L4 and L5 tend to collect dust and debris, whereas L1-L3 require active orbital stationkeeping|station-keeping measures to maintain a stable position, make them somewhat less suitable places for habitation than was originally believed. Additionally, the orbit of L2–L5 takes them out of the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere for approximately two-thirds of the time, exposing them to the health threat from cosmic rays.

The five Earth–Sun Lagrange points would totally eliminate eclipses, but only L1 and L2 would be reachable in a few days' time. The other three Earth–Sun points would require months to reach.

Mercury

specific|section|date=August 2018
Colonizing Mercury would involve similar challenges as the Moon as there are few volatile elements, no atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than Earth's. However, the planet also receives almost seven times the solar flux as the Earth/Moon system.citation needed|date=August 2018

Geologist Stephen Gillett suggested in 1996 that this could make Mercury an ideal place to build and launch solar sail spacecraft, which could launch as folded up "chunks" by mass driver from Mercury's surface.  Once in space the solar sails would deploy. Since Mercury's solar constant is 6.5 times higher than Earth's, energy for the mass driver should be easy to come by, and solar sails near Mercury would have 6.5 times the thrust they do near Earth. This could make Mercury an ideal place to acquire materials useful in building hardware to send to (and terraform) Venus. Vast solar collectors could also be built on or near Mercury to produce power for large scale engineering activities such as laser-pushed lightsails to nearby star systems.<ref>Stanley Schmidt and Robert Zubrin, eds., "Islands in the Sky: Bold New Ideas for Colonizing Space"; Wiley, 1996, p. 71-84</ref>

Colonization of asteroids would require space habitats. The asteroid belt has significant overall material available, the largest object being Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres, although it is thinly distributed as it covers a vast region of space. Unmanned supply craft should be practical with little technological advance, even crossing 500 million kilometers of space. The colonists would have a strong interest in assuring their asteroid did not hit Earth or any other body of significant mass, but would have extreme difficulty in moving an asteroidcitation needed|date=August 2017 of any size. The orbits of the Earth and most asteroids are very distant from each other in terms of delta-v and the asteroidal bodies have enormous momentum. Rockets or mass drivers can perhaps be installed on asteroids to direct their path into a safe course.

The Artemis Project designed a plan to colonize Europa (moon)|Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. Scientists were to inhabit igloos and drill down into the Europan ice crust, exploring any sub-surface ocean. This plan discusses possible use of "air pockets" for human habitation. Europa is considered one of the more habitable bodies in the Solar System and so merits investigation as a possible abode for life.

Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus is a small, icy moon orbiting close to Saturn, notable for its extremely bright surface and the geyser-like plumes of ice and water vapor that erupt from its southern polar region.

=Outside the Solar System=
File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|right|A star forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud
Looking beyond the Solar System, there are up to several hundred billion potential stars with possible colonization targets. The main difficulty is the vast distances to other stars: roughly a hundred thousand times further away than the planets in the Solar System. This means that some combination of very high speed (some percentage of the speed of light), or travel times lasting centuries or millennia, would be required. These speeds are far beyond what current spacecraft propulsion systems can provide.

Many scientific papers have been published about interstellar travel. Given sufficient travel time and engineering work, both unmanned and generational voyages seem possible, though representing a very considerable technological and economic challenge unlikely to be met for some time, particularly for manned probes.citation needed|date=October 2015

Space colonization technology could in principle allow human expansion at high, but sub-relativistic speeds, substantially less than the speed of light, ''c''.&nbsp; An interstellar colony ship would be similar to a space habitat, with the addition of major propulsion capabilities and independent energy generation.

Hypothetical starship concepts proposed both by scientists and in hard science fiction include:
* A generation ship would travel much slower than light, with consequent interstellar trip times of many decades or centuries. The crew would go through generations before the journey is complete, so that none of the initial crew would be expected to survive to arrive at the destination, assuming current human lifespans.
* A sleeper ship, in which most or all of the crew spend the journey in some form of hibernation or suspended animation, allowing some or all who undertake the journey to survive to the end.
* An embryo space colonization|embryo-carrying interstellar starship (EIS), much smaller than a generation ship or sleeper ship, transporting human embryos or DNA in a frozen or dormant state to the destination. (Obvious biological and psychological problems in birthing, raising, and educating such voyagers, neglected here, may not be fundamental.)
* A nuclear fusion or nuclear fission|fission powered ship (e.g. ion drive) of some kind, achieving velocities of up to perhaps 10% ''c''&nbsp; permitting one-way trips to nearby stars with durations comparable to a human lifetime.
* A Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion-ship, a nuclear-powered concept proposed by Freeman Dyson which would use nuclear bomb|nuclear explosions to propel a starship. A special case of the preceding nuclear rocket concepts, with similar potential velocity capability, but possibly easier technology.
* Solar sail|Laser propulsion concepts, using some form of beaming of power from the Solar System might allow a solar sail|light-sail or other ship to reach high speeds, comparable to those theoretically attainable by the fusion-powered electric rocket, above. These methods would need some means, such as supplementary nuclear propulsion, to stop at the destination, but a hybrid (light-sail for acceleration, fusion-electric for deceleration) system might be possible.

The above concepts all appear limited to high, but still sub-relativistic speeds, due to fundamental energy and reaction mass considerations, and all would entail trip times which might be enabled by space colonization technology, permitting self-contained habitats with lifetimes of decades to centuries. Yet human interstellar expansion at average speeds of even 0.1% of ''c''&nbsp; would permit settlement of the entire Galaxy in less than one half of a galactic rotation period of ~250,000,000 years, which is comparable to the timescale of other galactic processes. Thus, even if interstellar travel at near relativistic speeds is never feasible (which cannot be clearly determined at this time), the development of space colonization could allow human expansion beyond the Solar System without requiring technological advances that cannot yet be reasonably foreseen. This could greatly improve the chances for the survival of intelligent life over cosmic timescales, given the many natural and human-related hazards that have been widely noted.

If humanity does gain access to a large amount of energy, on the order of the mass-energy of entire planets, it may eventually become feasible to construct Alcubierre drives. These are one of the few methods of superluminal travel which may be possible under current physics. However it is probable that such a device could never exist, due to the fundamental challenges posed. For more on this see Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|Difficulties of making and using an Alcubierre Drive.

Intergalactic travel
Main|Intergalactic travel 
Looking beyond the Milky Way, there are at least 2 trillion other galaxies in the observable universe. The distances between galaxies are on the order of a million times farther than those between the stars. Because of the speed of light limit on how fast any material objects can travel in space, intergalactic travel would either have to involve voyages lasting millions of years,<ref>Stuart Armstrong and Anders Sandberg, "Eternity in six hours: Intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox," ''Acta Astronautica'' 89 (2013): 1–13.</ref> or a possible faster than light propulsion method based on speculative physics, such as the Alcubierre drive. There are, however, no scientific reasons for stating that intergalactic travel is impossible in principle.

Funding
Space colonization can roughly be said to be possible when the necessary methods of space colonization become Economic behavior|cheap enough (such as space access by cheaper launch systems) to meet the cumulative funds that have been gathered for the purpose.

The first known work on space colonization was ''The Brick Moon'', a work of fiction published in 1869 by Edward Everett Hale, about an inhabited artificial satellite.<ref>E. E. Hale. ''The Brick Moon''. Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 24, 1869.</ref>

The Russian schoolmaster and physicist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky foresaw elements of the space community in his book ''Beyond Planet Earth'' written about 1900. Tsiolkovsky had his space travelers building greenhouses and raising crops in space.<ref>K. E. Tsiolkovsky. ''Beyond Planet Earth''. Trans. by Kenneth Syers. Oxford, 1960</ref> Tsiolkovsky believed that going into space would help perfect human beings, leading to immortality and peace.<ref name="bio">[http://www.informatics.org/museum/tsiol.html The life of Konstantin Eduardovitch Tsiolkovsky 1857–1935] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615044125/http://www.informatics.org/museum/tsiol.html |date=June 15, 2012 </ref>

Others have also written about space colonies as Lasswitz in 1897 and Bernal, Oberth, Von Pirquet and Noordung in the 1920s. Wernher von Braun contributed his ideas in a 1952 ''Colliers'' article. In the 1950s and 1960s, Dandridge M. Cole<ref>Dandridge M. Cole and Donald W. Cox ''Islands in Space.'' Chilton, 1964</ref> published his ideas.

Another seminal book on the subject was the book ''The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space'' by Gerard K. O'Neill<ref>G. K. O'Neill. ''The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space''. Morrow, 1977.</ref> in 1977 which was followed the same year by ''Colonies in Space '' by T. A. Heppenheimer.<ref>T. A. Heppenheimer. ''Colonies in Space''. Stackpole Books, 1977</ref>

M. Dyson wrote ''Home on the Moon; Living on a Space Frontier'' in 2003;<ref>Marianne J. Dyson: Living on a Space Frontier. National Geographic, 2003</ref> Peter Eckart wrote ''Lunar Base Handbook'' in 2006<ref>Peter Eckart. ''Lunar Base Handbook''.

Planetary protection

Robotic spacecraft to Mars are required to be sterilized, to have at most 300,000 spores on the exterior of the craft—and more thoroughly sterilized if they contact "special regions" containing water,<ref name=groundwatercontamination>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-27526981 Queens University Belfast scientist helps NASA Mars project] "No-one has yet proved that there is deep groundwater on Mars, but it is plausible as there is certainly surface ice and atmospheric water vapour, so we wouldn't want to contaminate it and make it unusable by the introduction of micro-organisms."</ref><ref name="COSPAR PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICY">[https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2012/05/04/COSPAR_Planetary_Protection_Policy_v3-24-11.pdf COSPAR PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICY] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306111646/https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2012/05/04/COSPAR_Planetary_Protection_Policy_v3-24-11.pdf |date=2013-03-06  (20 October 2002; As Amended to 24 March 2011)</ref> otherwise there is a risk of contaminating not only the life-detection experiments but possibly the planet itself.

It is impossible to sterilize human missions to this level, as humans are host to typically a hundred trillion microorganisms of thousands of species of the human microbiome, and these cannot be removed while preserving the life of the human. Containment seems the only option, but it is a major challenge in the event of a hard landing (i.e. crash).<ref name=biospherescollide>[http://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/when_biospheres_collide_detail.html#.U_uVh_mwJcQ When Biospheres Collide – a history of NASA's Planetary Protection Programs], Michael Meltzer , May 31, 2012, see Chapter 7, Return to Mars – final section: "Should we do away with human missions to sensitive targets"</ref> There have been several planetary workshops on this issue, but with no final guidelines for a way forward yet.<ref>Johnson, James E.

A contaminated vehicle or item of equipment returned to Earth could also be a source of contamination."</ref>

 Objections

A corollary to the Fermi paradox—"nobody else is doing it"<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/06/26/no-we-cannot-know-whether-humans-are-alone-in-the-universe/|title=No, We Haven't Solved The Drake Equation, The Fermi Paradox, Or Whether Humans Are Alone|last=Siegel|first=Ethan|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en</ref>—is the argument that, because no evidence of Fermi paradox#Alien constructs|alien colonization technology exists, it is statistically unlikely to even be possible to use that same level of technology ourselves.<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/why-aliens-have-not-contacted-humans-2015-9|title=The likeliest reasons why we haven’t contacted aliens are deeply unsettling|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-14</ref>

Colonizing space would require massive amounts of financial, physical, and human capital devoted to research, development, production, and deployment. Earth's natural resources do not increase to a noteworthy extent (which is in keeping with the "only one Earth" position of environmentalists). Thus, considerable efforts in colonizing places outside Earth would appear as a hazardous waste of the Earth's limited resources for an aim without a clear end.

The fundamental problem of public things, needed for survival, such as space programs, is the free rider problem. Convincing the public to fund such programs would require additional self-interest arguments: If the objective of space colonization is to provide a "backup" in case everyone on Earth is killed, then why should someone on Earth pay for something that is only useful after they are dead? This assumes that space colonization is not widely acknowledged as a sufficiently valuable social goal.<ref>Cite news|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/free-rider/|title=Free Rider - Overview, Examples of Free Rider Problem in Society|work=Corporate Finance Institute|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US</ref>

Seen as a relief to the problem of overpopulation even as early as 1758,<ref name = tsr2009>[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1296/1 Planetary demographics and space colonization]; Nader Elhefnawy, The Space Review, February 2, 2009.</ref><!--would be best if the original article that Otto Diederich Lutken published were put here--> and listed as one of Stephen Hawking's reasons for pursuing space exploration,<ref>cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/7935505/Stephen-Hawking-mankind-must-move-to-outer-space-within-a-century.html|title=Stephen Hawking: mankind must move to outer space within a century|publisher=|date=2010-08-09|last1=Alleyne|first1=Richard</ref> it has become apparent that space colonisation in response to overpopulation is unwarranted. Indeed, the List of sovereign states and dependent territories by fertility rate|birth rates of many developed countries, specifically spacefaring|spacefaring ones, are at or below replacement rates, thus negating the need to use colonisation as a means of population control.<ref name = tsr2009/>

Other objections include concerns that the forthcoming colonization and commodification of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and military institutions e.g. the large financial institutions, the major aerospace companies and the military–industrial complex, to lead to new wars, and to exacerbate pre-existing exploitation of Exploitation of labour|workers and Exploitation of natural resources|resources, economic inequality, poverty, social Social division|division and Social exclusion|marginalization, environmental degradation, and other detrimental processes or institutions.<ref name=Dickens-MR-2010-11/><ref name=Dickens-MR-2008-02/><ref name=Dickens-MR-2017-03/>

Additional concerns include creating a culture in which humans are no longer seen as human, but rather as material assets. The issues of human dignity, morality, philosophy, culture, bioethics, and the threat of megalomaniac leaders in these new "societies" would all have to be addressed in order for space colonization to meet the psychology|psychological and Group (sociology)|social needs of people living in isolated colonies.<ref>[http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/sociology.html Sociology and Space Development] B.J. Bluth, Sociology Department, California State University, Northridge, SPACE SOCIAL SCIENCE</ref>

As an alternative or addendum for the future of the human race, many science fiction writers have focused on the realm of the 'inner-space', that is the computer-aided exploration of the human mind and human consciousness—possibly en route developmentally to a Matrioshka Brain.<ref>Cite web|url=https://curiosity.com/topics/a-matrioshka-brain-is-a-computer-the-size-of-a-solar-system-curiosity/|title=A Matrioshka Brain Is A Computer The Size Of A Solar System|website=curiosity.com|access-date=2018-08-14</ref>

Another concern is the potential to cause interplanetary contamination on planets that may harbor hypothetical extraterrestrial life.
