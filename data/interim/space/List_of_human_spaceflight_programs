For|a chronological list of human spaceflights, including crews, dates and mission summaries|List of human spaceflights

This is a list of human spaceflight programs, including successful programs, programs that were canceled, and programs planned for the future. The criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI defines spaceflight as any flight over convert|100|km|mi|sp=us. In the United States, professional, military, and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of convert|80|km|mi|sp=us are awarded astronaut wings. This article follows the FAI definition of spaceflight.

Until the 21st century, human spaceflight programs were sponsored exclusively by governments, through either the military or civilian space agencies. With the launch of the privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004, a new category of human spaceflight programs – commercial astronaut|commercial human spaceflight – arrived.

Successful programs
Programs in this section are sorted by the years when the first successful crewed spaceflight took place.

=Vostok program (USSR, 1956–1964)=
Image:Vostok spacecraft.jpg|thumb|300px|Model of Vostok spacecraft with third stage of launcher
The Vostok program was a project that succeeded in putting a person into orbit for the first time. Sergei Korolev and Konstantin Feoktistov began, in June 1956, manned spacecraft research.<ref>http://www.astronautix.com/project/vostok.htm#chrono</ref> The program developed the Vostok spacecraft from the Zenit spy satellite project and adapted the Vostok rocket from an existing ICBM design. Just before the first release of the name Vostok to the press, it was a classified word. By August/September 1958 a division had been formed devoted to producing the first Vostok craft. The official approval (decree) for the Vostok was delayed until 22 May 1959 by competition with photo reconnaissance programs.

Vostok 1 was the first human spaceflight. The Vostok 3KA spacecraft was launched on April 12, 1961, taking  into space Yuri Gagarin, a astronaut|cosmonaut from the Soviet Union. The Vostok 1 mission was the first time anyone had journeyed into outer space and the first time anyone had entered into Orbit (celestial mechanics)|orbit.

There were six Vostok flights in total. Another seven Vostok flights (Vostok 7 to 13) were originally planned, going through to April 1966, but these were canceled and the components recycled into the Voskhod program, which was intended to achieve more Soviet firsts in space.

=Project Mercury (USA, 1959–1963)=<!--considering how wrong the vostok timeline was, this could probably use checking as well-->
Image:Mercury Capsule2.png|thumb|left|Mercury capsule with escape tower

Project Mercury was the first human spaceflight program of the  United States. It ran from 1959 through 1963 with the goal of putting a human in orbit around the Earth. The Mercury-Atlas 6 flight on 20 February 1962 was the first Mercury flight to achieve this goal.

Early planning and research was carried out by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and the program was officially conducted by the newly created NASA.

Because of their small size it was said that the Mercury spacecraft capsules were worn, not ridden. With 1.7 cubic meters of habitable volume, the capsule was just large enough for the single crew member. Inside were 120 controls: 55 electrical switches, 30 fuses and 35 mechanical levers. The spacecraft was designed by Maxime Faget|Max Faget and NASA's Space Task Group.

NASA ordered 20 production spacecraft, numbered 1 through 20, from McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell Aircraft Company, St. Louis, Missouri. Five of the twenty spacecraft, #10, 12, 15, 17, and 19, were not flown. Spacecraft #3 and #4 were destroyed during unmanned test flights. Mercury-Redstone 4|Spacecraft #11 sank and was recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after 38 years. Some spacecraft were modified after initial production (refurbished after launch abort, modified for longer missions, etc.) and received a letter designation after their number, examples 2A, 15B. Some spacecraft were modified twice; for example, spacecraft 15 became 15A and then 15B.

=North American X-15 (USA, 1954–1968)=
Image:X-15 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|X-15 in flight
The North American Aviation|North American X-15 rocket-powered aircraft was part of the X-plane (aircraft)|X-series of experimental aircraft, initiated with the Bell X-1, that were made for the USAF, NASA, and the USN. The X-15 set speed and altitude records in the early 1960s, reaching the Kármán line|edge of outer space and returning with valuable data used in aircraft and spacecraft design. It currently holds the world record for the fastest speed ever reached by a manned aircraft.<ref name="Fastest">[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/research/x15/ "Aerospaceweb.org | Aircraft Museum X-15".] Aerospaceweb.org, 24 November 2008.</ref>

During the X-15 program, 13 of the flights (by eight pilots) met the USAF human spaceflight|spaceflight criteria by exceeding the altitude of 50&nbsp;miles (80.47&nbsp;km. 264,000&nbsp;ft.), thus qualifying the pilots for astronaut status; some pilots also qualified for NASA astronaut wings.<ref name="Jenkins">Jenkins, Dennis R.

=Voskhod program (USSR, 1964–1965)=
<!-- WP:NFCC violation: Image:Voskhod2.jpg|left -->

The Voskhod program (lang-ru|Восход, ''"ascent"'', ''"dawn"'') was a Soviet human spaceflight project. Voskhod development was both a follow-on to the Vostok program, recycling components left over from that program's cancellation following its first six flights. The two missions flown used the Voskhod spacecraft and Voskhod rocket|rocket.

The Voskhod spacecraft was basically a Vostok spacecraft that had a backup, solid fuel retrorocket added to the top of the descent module. The heavier weight of the craft was made possible by improvements to the R-7 Semyorka-derived booster. The ejection seat was removed and two or three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the Vostok crew position. However, the position of the in-flight controls was not changed, so the crew had to crane their heads 90 degrees to see the instruments.

While the Vostok program was dedicated more towards understanding the effects of space travel and microgravity on the human body, Voskhod's two flights were more aimed towards spectacular "firsts". Although achieving the first Extra-vehicular activity|EVA ("spacewalk") became the main success of the program, beating the U.S. Gemini project to put the first multi-person crew in orbit was the objective that initially motivated the program. Once both goals were realized, the program was abandoned. This followed the change in Soviet leadership, which was less concerned about stunt and prestige flights, and allowed the Soviet designers to concentrate on the Soyuz program.

=Project Gemini (USA, 1965–1966)=

Image:Gemini 6 7.jpg|right|250px|Gemini spacecraft on orbit

Project Gemini was the second human spaceflight program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It operated between Projects Mercury and Apollo, with 10 manned flights occurring in 1965 and 1966. Its objective was to develop techniques for advanced space travel, notably those necessary for Project Apollo, whose objective was to land humans on the Moon. Gemini missions included the first American Extra-vehicular activity|extravehicular activity, and new orbital maneuvers including Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking.

Gemini was originally seen as a simple extrapolation of the Mercury program, and thus early on was called ''Mercury Mark II''. The actual program had little in common with Mercury and was Big Gemini|superior to even Apollo in some ways. This was mainly a result of its late start date, which allowed it to benefit from much that had been learned during the early stages of the Apollo project (which, despite its later launch dates, was actually begun before Gemini).
Of all the X-15 missions, two flights by Joseph A. Walker in 1963 qualified as space flights, per the international Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI definition of a spaceflight by exceeding a 100&nbsp;kilometer (62.137&nbsp;mi, 328,084&nbsp;ft) altitude.

=Soyuz program (USSR/Russia, 1967–ongoing)=
Image:Soyuz rocket ASTP.jpg|thumb|left|Soyuz rocket on launch pad.

The Soyuz program (lang-ru|Союз, IPA-ru|sɐˈjus|pron, meaning "Union") is a human spaceflight program that was initiated by the Soviet Union in early 1967. It was originally part of a Moon landing program intended to put a Soviet astronaut|cosmonaut on the Moon. All experimental or unsuccessful starts received the status of satellites of a series Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos, and flights of the Lunar orbital ships around the Moon – the name Zond program|Zond. Both the Soyuz spacecraft and the Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket are part of this program, which is now the responsibility of the Russian Federal Space Agency.

The basic Soyuz spacecraft design was the basis for many projects, many of which never came to light. Its earliest form was intended to travel to the moon without employing a huge booster like the Saturn V or the Soviet N1 rocket|N-1 by repeatedly docking with upper stages that had been put in orbit using the same rocket as the Soyuz. This and the initial civilian designs were done under the Soviet Chief Designer Sergei Korolev|Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, who did not live to see the craft take flight. Several military derivatives actually took precedence in the Soviet design process, though they never came to pass.

The launch vehicles used in the Soyuz expendable launch system are manufactured at the Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center (TsSKB-Progress) in Samara, Russia. As well as being used in the Soyuz program as the launcher for the manned Soyuz spacecraft, Soyuz launch vehicles are now also used to launch unmanned Progress spacecraft|Progress supply spacecraft to the International Space Station and commercial launches marketed and operated by TsSKB-Progress and the Starsem company.  There were 11 Soyuz launches in 2001 and 9 in 2002. Currently, Soyuz vehicles are launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwest Russia. Since 2009 Soyuz launch vehicles are also being launched from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana.<ref name=sitehw>cite web |url=http://www.arianespace.com/news-soyuz-vega/2008/2008-10-03-Vega-Soyuz.asp |title=The Spaceport’s new Soyuz launch site is ready for installation of its mission equipment |date=October 3, 2008 |publisher=Arianespace |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415214124/http://www.arianespace.com/news-soyuz-vega/2008/2008-10-03-Vega-Soyuz.asp |archivedate=April 15, 2009 |df= </ref>

=Project Apollo (USA, 1961–1975)=
File:Apollo 15 Lunar Rover and Irwin.jpg|thumb|Lunar Roving Vehicle used on Apollos 15–17

Apollo was a program undertaken by NASA during the years 1961–1975 with the goal of conducting manned moon landing missions. In 1961, President of the United States|President John F. Kennedy announced a goal of landing a man on the moon by the end of the decade.  It was accomplished on July 20, 1969, by the landing of astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, with Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins orbiting above during the Apollo 11 mission. Five other Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last one in 1972. These six Apollo spaceflights are the only times humans have landed on another celestial body.<ref>[https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/missions.htm 30th Anniversary of Apollo 11, Manned Apollo Missions], NASA, 1999.</ref>

Apollo was the third human spaceflight program undertaken by NASA, the space agency of the United States. It used Apollo spacecraft and Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn launch vehicles, which were later used for the Skylab|Skylab program and the joint American-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. These later programs are thus often considered to be part of the overall Apollo program.

The goal of the program, as articulated by President Kennedy, was accomplished with only two major failures. The first failure resulted in the deaths of three astronauts, Gus Grissom, Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White and Roger Chaffee, in the Apollo 1 launchpad fire. The second was an in-space explosion on Apollo 13, which badly damaged the spacecraft on the moonward leg of its journey. The three astronauts aboard narrowly escaped with their lives, thanks to the efforts of flight controllers, project engineers, backup crew members and the skills of the astronauts themselves.

=Space Shuttle (USA, 1972–2011)=
Image:STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg|thumb|Space Shuttle ''Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery'' launches at the start of STS-120
NASA's Space Shuttle, officially called "Space Transportation System" (STS), is the United States government's most recent manned launch vehicle and is retired from service as of|2011|lc=y. The winged Space Shuttle orbiter is launched vertically, usually carrying five to seven astronauts (although eight have been carried) and up to 50,000&nbsp;Pound (mass)|lb  (22&nbsp;700&nbsp;kg) of payload into low earth orbit. When its mission is complete, the Space Shuttle|shuttle can independently move itself out of orbit (by means of making a 180-degree turn and firing its main engines, thus slowing it down) and  atmospheric reentry|re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. During descent and landing, the orbiter acts as a glider and makes a completely unpowered landing.

The shuttle is the only winged manned spacecraft to achieve orbit and land, and the only reusable space vehicle that has ever made multiple flights into orbit. Its List of space shuttle missions|missions involve carrying large payloads to various orbits (including segments to be added to the International Space Station), providing crew rotation for the International Space Station, and performing service missions. The orbiter can also recover satellites and other payloads from orbit and return them to Earth, but its use in this capacity is rare. However, the shuttle has previously been used to return large payloads from the ISS to Earth, as the Russian Soyuz spacecraft has limited capacity for return payloads. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years' operational life.

=Shenzhou programme (China, 1992–ongoing)=
File:Post S-7 Shenzhou spacecraft.png|thumb|left
The Shenzhou program (zh|c=神舟 |p=Shén Zhōu) is a manned spaceflight initiative by the People's Republic of China. The program put the first Chinese citizen into orbit on 15 October 2003.

Development began in 1992, under the name of Project 921-1. The Space program of China|Chinese National Manned Space Program was given the designation Project 921 with Project 921-1 as its first significant goal. The plan called for a manned launch in October 1999, prior to the new millennium. The first four unmanned test flights happened in 1999, 2001 and 2002.  These were followed with three manned launches in 2003, 2005, and 2008. Unmanned and manned launches to test docking occurred in 2011 and 2012 respectively. It is launched on the Long March 2F from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.  The command center of the mission is the Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center.

The name is variously translated as "Divine Craft", "Divine Vessel" or similar, but is also a reference to a literary Names of China|name for China with the same pronunciation (神州; literally "Divine Land").

=SpaceShipOne/SpaceShipTwo (United States, 2004–ongoing)=
File:SpaceShipOne Flight 15P photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|300px|right
Virgin Galactic is a company within Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group, which is developing a privately funded spacecraft in conjunction with Scaled Composites to offer sub-orbital spaceflights and later orbital spaceflights to the paying public. SpaceShipOne reached space with a pilot in three test flights in 2004.

Tier One is Scaled Composites' program of suborbital human spaceflight using the Reusable launch system|reusable spacecraft Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne and its launcher Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight. The craft are designed by Burt Rutan, and the project is funded 20 million US Dollars by Paul Allen.  In 2004 it made the SpaceShipOne flight 15P|first privately funded human spaceflight and won the 10 million US Dollars Ansari X Prize for the first non-governmental reusable manned spacecraft.

The objective of the project is to develop technology for low-cost routine access to space.  Tier One is not itself intended to carry paying passengers, but it is envisioned that there will be commercial spinoffs, initially in space tourism.  The company Mojave Aerospace Ventures was formed to manage commercial exploitation of the technology.  A deal with Virgin Galactic could see routine space tourism, using a spacecraft based on Tier One technology.

The model finally developed into SpaceShipTwo, Virgin Galactic's second generation suborbital vehicle. On 10 October 2010, VSS ''Enterprise'', the first SpaceShipTwo spaceplane, made its first manned gliding test flight. By October 2014 SpaceShipTwo had conducted 54 test flights.<ref name="space20141008">cite news |url=http://www.space.com/27376-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-test-flight.html |title= Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo Aces Glide Test Flight |work=Space.com |date=8 October 2014 |accessdate=8 October 2014 |last=Wall |first=Mike</ref> On October 31, 2014, SpaceShipTwo VSS ''Enterprise'' suffered an in-flight breakup during a powered flight test,<ref>cite web|url=http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x1143260271/SpaceShipTwo-experiences-in-flight-anomaly|title=SpaceShipTwo disaster: Industry mourns pilot but vows to keep ... - BakersfieldCalifornian.com|work=The Bakersfield Californian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023044651/http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x1143260271/SpaceShipTwo-experiences-in-flight-anomaly|archivedate=2015-10-23|df=</ref><ref name = nbc_premature_deploy>Cite news|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/virgin-voyage/spaceshiptwo-feather-tail-system-deployed-prematurely-ntsb-n239721|title = SpaceShipTwo 'Feather' Tail System Deployed Prematurely: NTSB|last = |first = |date = |work = </ref> resulting in a crash killing one pilot and injuring the other.

Successful Space station programs

(Dates refer to periods when stations were inhabited by crews.)

=Salyut stations (USSR, 1971–1986)=
<!-- Commented out: Image:Salyut 7 from Soyuz T-13.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Salyut 7, the final Salyut station to be launched, as seen from the departing Soyuz T-13 spacecraft -->
The Salyut program was the first space station program undertaken by the Soviet Union, which consisted of a series of four crewed scientific research space stations and two crewed military reconnaissance space stations over a period of 15 years from 1971 to 1986. Two other Salyut launches failed.  Salyut was, on the one hand, designed to carry out long-term research into the problems of living in space and a variety of astronomical, biological and Earth-resources experiments, and on the other hand this civilian program was used as a cover for the highly secretive military Almaz stations, which flew under the Salyut designation. Salyut 1, the first station in the program, became the world's first crewed space station. Salyut broke several spaceflight records, including several mission duration records, the first ever orbital handover of a space station from one crew to another, and various spacewalk records.

*Salyut 1/DOS-1 (1971, 1 crew and 1 failed docking)
*Salyut 2/Almaz/OPS-1 (1973, failed shortly after launch)
*Salyut 3/Almaz/OPS-2 (1974, 1 crew and 1 failed docking)
*Salyut 4/DOS-4 (1975–1976, 2 crews)
*Salyut 5/Almaz/OPS-3 (1976–1977, 2 crews and 1 failed docking)
*Salyut 6/DOS-5 (1977–1981, 16 crews (5 long duration, 11 short duration) and 1 failed docking)
*Salyut 7/DOS-6 (1982–1986, 10 crews (6 long duration, 4 short duration) and 1 failed docking)

=Skylab (USA, 1973–1974)=
File:Skylab (SL-4).jpg|thumb
Skylab was launched and operated by NASA and was the United States' first space station. Skylab orbited Earth from 1973 to 1979, and included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems. It was launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of convert|169,950|lb|MT|0. Three manned missions to the station, conducted between 1973 and 1974 using the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) atop the smaller Saturn IB, each delivered a three-astronaut crew. On the last two manned missions, an additional Apollo / Saturn IB stood by ready to rescue the crew in orbit if it was needed.

=Mir (USSR/Russia, 1986–2001)=
File:Mir Space Station viewed from Endeavour during STS-89.jpg|thumb|left
Mir was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986&nbsp;to&nbsp;1996.  It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. Until 21 March 2001 it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit, succeeded by the International Space Station after Mir's Orbital decay|orbit decayed. The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space.

Mir was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit and set the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days until 23 October 2010 when it was surpassed by the International Space Station|ISS.<ref name="Mirrecord">cite news|last=Jackman|first=Frank|title=ISS Passing Old Russian Mir In Crewed Time|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&id=news/asd/2010/10/28/11.xml|newspaper=Aviation Week|date=29 October 2010</ref> It holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight, with Valeri Polyakov spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995. Mir was occupied for a total of twelve and a half years out of its fifteen-year lifespan, having the capacity to support a resident crew of three, or larger crews for short term visits. Mir had List of Mir Expeditions|28 long duration crews.

The XCOR Lynx is a suborbital HTHL|horizontal-takeoff, horizontal-landing (HTHL),
rocket-powered aircraft|rocket-powered spaceplane under development by the California-based company XCOR Aerospace to compete in the emerging suborbital spaceflight market. The Lynx is projected to carry one pilot, a ticketed passenger, and/or a payload above 100&nbsp;km altitude. The Mark I test model will reach only convert|200,000|ft|km; the Mark II production model will be sub-orbital.

According to a September 2015 report, the first flight of the Lynx spaceplane was likely to be in the second quarter of 2016 from Midland, Texas,<ref>http://www.mrt.com/business/development/article_59287c2e-5682-11e5-b319-e7ad9e129220.html?mode=jqm</ref> but the company halted spaceplane development in May 2016 and refocused on its LOX/H2 engine technology.<ref name=sn20160531>
