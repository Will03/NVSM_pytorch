Bremermann's limit, named after  Hans-Joachim Bremermann, is the maximum computational speed of a self-contained system in the material universe.  It is derived from Albert Einstein|Einstein's E = mc2|mass-energy equivalency and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and is ''speed of light|c''<sup>2</sup>/''Planck's constant|h'' ≈ 1.36&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>50</sup> bits per second per kilogram.<ref>Bremermann, H.J.

Yovits et al., Spartan Books, Washington, D.C. pp. 93–106.</ref><ref>Bremermann, H.J. (1965) [http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bsmsp/1200513783 Quantum noise and information]. 5th Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability; Univ. of California Press, Berkeley, California.</ref> This value is important when designing cryptography|cryptographic algorithms, as it can be used to determine the minimum size of encryption keys or hash values required to create an algorithm that could never be cracked by a brute-force search.

For example, a computer with the mass of the entire Earth operating at the Bremermann's limit could perform approximately 10<sup>75</sup> mathematical computations per second. If one assumes that a cryptographic key can be tested with only one operation, then a typical 128-bit key could be cracked in under 10<sup>−36</sup> seconds. However, a 256-bit key (which is already in use in some systems) would take about two minutes to crack. Using a 512-bit key would increase the cracking time to approaching 10<sup>72</sup> years, without increasing the time for encryption by more than a constant factor (depending on the encryption algorithms used).

The limit has been further analysed in later literature as the maximum rate at which a system with energy spread <math>\Delta E</math> can evolve into an orthogonal and hence distinguishable state to another, <math>\Delta t = \pi \hbar / 2 \Delta E</math>.<ref name="Aharonov1961">Cite journal
