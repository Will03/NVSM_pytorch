 <span id="The Omega Point">The Omega Point cosmology</span> 
The ''Omega Point'' is a term Tipler uses to describe a Physical cosmology|cosmological state in the distant Proper time|proper-time future of the universe that he maintains is required by the known physical laws.  According to this cosmology, it is required for the known laws of physics to be mutually consistent that intelligent life take over all matter in the universe and eventually force its collapse. During that collapse, the computational capacity of the universe diverges to infinity and environments Computer simulation|emulated with that computational capacity last for an Immortality|infinite duration as the universe attains a solitary-point Gravitational singularity|cosmological singularity. This singularity is Tipler's Omega Point.<ref name = "Tipler2007">Harvnb | Tipler | Graber | McGinley | Nichols-Barrer | 2007.</ref> With computational resources diverging to infinity, Tipler states that a society far in the future would be able to resurrect the dead by emulating all Many-worlds interpretation|alternative universes of our universe from its start at the Big Bang.Sfn | Tipler | 1989  Tipler identifies the Omega Point with God, since, in his view, the Omega Point has all the properties of God, claimed by most of the traditional religions.Sfn | Tipler | 1989<ref name = "Tipler1997">Harvnb | Tipler |  1997 | p = 560</ref>

Tipler's argument that the omega point cosmology is required by the known physical laws is a more recent development that arose after the publication of his 1994 book ''The Physics of Immortality''. In that book (and in papers he had published up to that time), Tipler had offered the Omega Point cosmology as a hypothesis, while still claiming to confine the analysis to the known laws of physics.<ref name ="Tipler1986">Citation | first = Frank J | last = Tipler | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/vlj3180664373268/ | title = Cosmological Limits on Computation | journal = International Journal of Theoretical Physics | volume = 25 | number = 6 | date = June 1986 | pages = 617–61 | doi = 10.1007/BF00670475 | bibcode = 1986IJTP...25..617T (first paper on the Omega Point Theory).</ref>

Tipler defined the "final anthropic principle" (FAP) along with co-author physicist John D. Barrow in their 1986 book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' as a generalization of the anthropic principle thus:
Quote | Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, will never die out.''<ref>BarrowTipler1986</ref>

One paraphrasing of Tipler's argument for FAP runs as follows. For the universe to logically exist, it must contain observers; otherwise it would be logically meaningless to state whether the universe does or doesn't exist. Our universe obviously exists. If the last observer in our universe died and there were no more observers, then the universe would no longer exist. It is inconsistent with the laws of physics for the universe to stop existing; therefore, there must be an "Omega Point" that sustains life forever.<ref name=nytimes>cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=George|title=The Odds on God|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/books/the-odds-on-god.html|accessdate=9 April 2018|date=1994|language=en</ref>

=Reception=
Tipler's Omega Point ideas have received vigorous criticism by physicists and skeptics.<ref name = "CSI">cite web | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_strange_case_of_frank_jennings_tipler | title =The Strange Case of Frank Jennings Tipler | last = Gardner | first = Martin | date = March–April 2008 |work=Book Review, "The Physics of Christianity" | publisher = The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry | accessdate = 29 June 2010</ref><ref>cite journal | first = John | last = Polkinghorne |title= I am the Alpha and the Omega Point | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14519634.400-i-am-the-alpha-and-the-omega-point.html | journal = New Scientist | date = 1995 | issue =1963 | page = 41</ref><ref>cite journal | title = Fossils Worth Studying | first = Richard G | last = Baker | format = PDF | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/sci;267/5200/1043?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&volume=267&firstpage=1043&resourcetype=HWCIT.pdf | journal = Science (journal)|Science | date = 1995 |volume= 267 | issue = 5200 | pages = 1043–44 |doi= 10.1126/science.267.5200.1043 | pmid = 17811443 | bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1043E</ref>  Some critics say its arguments violate the Copernican principle, that it incorrectly applies the laws of probability, and that it is really a theology or metaphysics principle made to sound plausible to laypeople by using the esoteric language of physics. Martin Gardner dubbed the Final Anthropic Principle, (FAP), the "completely ridiculous anthropic principle" (CRAP).<ref>Martin Gardner|Gardner, M., "WAP, SAP, PAP, and FAP," ''The New York Review of Books 23'', No. 8 (May 8, 1986): 22–25.</ref> Oxford-based philosopher Nick Bostrom writes that the final anthropic principle is "pure speculation" with no claim on any special methodological status, despite attempts to elevate it by calling it a "principle", but considers the Omega Point hypothesis to be an interesting philosophical hypothesis in its own right.<ref>cite book | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=TZ5FLwnCTMAC&pg=PA50 | title = Anthropic bias: observation selection effects in science and philosophy | accessdate= March 16, 2011 | last = Bostrom | first = Nick | date =2002 | publisher =Psychology Press | isbn = 978-0-415-93858-7</ref> Philosopher Rem B.

Physicist David Deutsch defends the physics of the Omega Point cosmology, and incorporates it as a central feature of the fourth strand of his "four strands" concept of fundamental reality;<ref name = "Deutsch1997">cite book | first = David | last = Deutsch |date = 1997 |title= The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications |location = London | publisher = Penguin Press |isbn=0-7139-9061-9 | chapter = The Ends of the Universe</ref> although he is highly critical of Tipler's theological conclusions<ref name = "Mackey">cite book | last = Mackey | first = James Patrick | date = 2000 |title= The critique of theological reason |url = https://books.google.com/?id=jNZy1docFVsC&pg=PA128 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-77293-8</ref> and what Deutsch states are exaggerated claims that have caused other scientists and philosophers to reject his theory out of hand.

George Francis Rayner Ellis|George Ellis, writing in the journal ''Nature (journal)|Nature'', described Tipler's book on the Omega Point as "a masterpiece of pseudoscience… the product of a fertile and creative imagination unhampered by the normal constraints of scientific and philosophical discipline",<ref name = "ellis1994b">cite journal | author-link = George Francis Rayner Ellis | first = George | last =  Ellis | title =Review of The Physics of Immortality |journal = Nature (journal)|Nature | format = PDF | date = 1994 | page = 115 |volume= 371 | issue = 6493 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v371/n6493/pdf/371115a0.pdf | doi = 10.1038/371115a0 | bibcode = 1994Natur.371..115E</ref> and Michael Shermer devoted a chapter of ''Why People Believe Weird Things'' to enumerating what he thought to be flaws in Tipler's thesis.<ref name = "Shermer">cite book | last= Shermer | first = Michael | title = Why People Believe Weird Things |date=1997 |publisher= W.H.
