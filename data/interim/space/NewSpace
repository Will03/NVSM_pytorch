History
The Space Race, which began in the mid-1950s and gave birth in earnest to spaceflight, was famously a manifestation of the then larger politico-economic competition between capitalism (represented by the United States) and communism (represented by the former Soviet Union). For this reason, from the very beginning, the American business establishment—particularly those bellwether private firms directly involved in the U.S. space program—has championed the private development of space and space activity. In 1961, writing as one of the deans of the American business establishment, Ralph J. Cordiner, then chairman of General Electric (a blue-chip, charter-prime contractor to NASA and the U.S. space program), contributed a chapter titled "Competitive Private Enterprise in Space" to the anthology ''Peacetime Uses of Outer Space''.<ref name="Peacetime">Cite book|title=Peacetime Uses of Outer Space|last=Ramo|first=Simon|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc.|year=1961|isbn=0070511659|location=|pages=213–240|quote=|via=</ref><ref name="Jacobson">Cite web|url=https://rjacobson.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cordiner-article-1961.pdf|title=Competitive Private Enterprise in Space|last=Cordiner|first=Ralph|date=1961|website=wordpress.com|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc.|access-date=2016-11-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117213456/https://rjacobson.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cordiner-article-1961.pdf|archivedate=17 November 2016|df=dmy-all</ref> While recognizing at the time the realities of having to initially rely on the U.S. government's vast and convenient organization, resources, and power in order to effectively address the immediate Soviet space challenge, Cordiner nonetheless advocated private sector dominance—ultimately—of space activity, consistent with textbook American capitalist ideals.<ref name="Peacetime" /><ref name="Jacobson" />

In fact, Syncom, Hughes Aircraft Company's pioneering commercial communications satellite system, was originally conceived as a direct competitive response by American private industry to the Soviet's successful deployment of Sputnik 1|Sputnik in 1957, the iconic Cold War event that triggered the Space Race.<ref name="Harold Rosen">Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/harold-rosen-launched-an-era-of-global-satellite-communications-1486738806|title=Harold Rosen Launched an Era of Global Satellite Communications|last=Hagerty|first=James|date=2017-02-10|website=wsj.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221080857/https://www.wsj.com/articles/harold-rosen-launched-an-era-of-global-satellite-communications-1486738806|archive-date=21 February 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-02-21|quote=After the Soviet Union launched its Sputnik satellite in 1957, American scientists were under the gun to top that stunning feat.

He later explained the Syncom project's lengthy gestation period:<blockquote>This was not the most auspicious time [late 1950s] to propose a commercial space program...The most vivid impression most people then had of space-related activities was of rockets blowing up at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral.<ref name="Harold Rosen" /></blockquote>

Notwithstanding the free-enterprise sentiments and preferences of American industry, space remained a firmly government-controlled and -directed endeavor well after the capstone Apollo moon landing in 1969.<ref name="Barcomb" /> The term "alt.space" was first used in the early 1980s to describe companies that were at last beginning to take up Cordiner's mantle and make serious efforts to reach outer space without needing or relying on the cooperation of NASA or other governmental agencies (or, by extension, even their major contractors); efforts which were catalyzed by an historic shift in U.S. policy favoring private space activity, culminating in the landmark Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984.<ref>[http://www.jeffkrukin.com/Space-Economy-Consulting/] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704110927/http://www.jeffkrukin.com/Space-Economy-Consulting/ |date=4 July 2008 </ref><ref>Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/09/dayintech0909privaterocket/|title=Sept. 9, 1982: 3-2-1 ...

Unfortunately, due to a lack of clear and consistent policies, the U.S. space community and NASA in particular has been slow to exploit these opportunities. In this paper an improved strategy for NASA's pursuit of Russian cooperation is developed that specifies the recommended areas in which to cooperate and the suggested means for implementation. [...] The strategy was developed using lessons learned from past and on-going joint aerospace projects with Russian as well as other international partners. [...] The analysis identifies newly emerging objectives for international space ventures in support of foreign policy and industrial competitiveness goals. NASA's present approach to cooperating with Russia is built upon short-term government-led projects that neglect these broader objectives. Recommendations for making space policy structures at NASA and at the national level more responsive to U.S. long-term strategic interests are presented to overcome this shortcoming.

Every bit as eccentric as the efforts that ''How to Make a Spaceship'' describes, Sea Launch fired large [Russian Zenit] rockets from a ship at the equator—equatorial water is the ideal position for space access—compiling a record of 32 successes, three failures and one satellite functioning but in the wrong orbit.<ref name="How To Make" /></blockquote>In 2001, the FAA/AST confirmed that NewSpace pioneer Sea Launch was indeed "[t]he first privately financed, working launch system and infrastructure...".<ref name="QLReport" />

The Mojave Air and Space Port is the spiritual heart of the industry that people call 'New Space.' [...] Old Space (and this is still the dreamers talking) is slow, bureaucratic, government-directed, completely top-down. Old Space is NASA, cautious and halting, supervising every project down to the last thousand-dollar widget. Old Space is Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman. Old Space coasts on the glory of the Apollo era and isn’t entirely sure what to do next. [...] New Space is the opposite of all that. It’s wild. It’s commercial, bootstrapping, imaginative, right up to the point of being (and this is no longer the dreamers talking) delusional. [...] Many of the New Space enterprises are still in the PowerPoint stage, with business models built around spaceships that haven’t yet gone to space. A bold attitude and good marketing aren’t enough to put a vehicle into orbit. The skeptics among the Old Space people will say to the upstarts: Where’s your rocket? How many times have you launched? Can you deliver reliably? Repeatedly? Safely? We put a man on the moon — what have you done? [...] Old Space and New Space turn out to be symbiotic.

=2000s: Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurial space initiatives=
Things changed further in the early 2000s as Elon Musk formed SpaceX with significantly more private capital while he articulated a strong and consistent vision of the "colonization of space, beginning with Mars."<ref name=ars20161006/>

However, one company in a worldwide milieu of government-driven spaceflight activities simply did not cement a movement.<ref name=ars20161006/> This began to change with the increasingly public revelations and pronouncements of Blue Origin after 2014. Even though the company was formed about the same time as SpaceX, it had maintained a very low profile in its first decade-and-a-half of existence. By 2016, both of these private companies, with billion-US-dollar-plus backing by committed investors, were successfully VTVL|vertically landing and reusable launch vehicle|reusing space launch vehicles. Both companies are building large reusable orbital launch systems<!-- Blue's New Glenn and SpaceX BFR (rocket) --> that will utilize currently-under-development rocket engines<!-- Blue BE-3 and BE-4; SpaceX Raptor rocket engine --> that are each at least four years along in development, and are already in use or under development test on ground test stands, all with a focus on radically lowering the price of carrying people and cargo to space.<ref name=ars20161006/><ref name="bt20120627">cite news |title=That "NewSpace Moment": Silicon Valley Redux |url=http://bigthink.com/above-the-clouds/that-newspace-moment-silicon-valley-redux |accessdate=2012-07-04 |newspaper=Big Think |date=2012-06-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007044847/http://bigthink.com/above-the-clouds/that-newspace-moment-silicon-valley-redux |archivedate=7 October 2012 |df=dmy-all </ref>

=Regulatory schemes=
In the United States, NewSpace firms and activities are primarily regulated by the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (generally referred to as FAA/AST). However, given the intersection of potentially many and varied agency-interests at stake in any NewSpace venture (e.g., FAA, Federal Communications Commission|FCC, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA, United States Department of Defense|DOD, NASA, Food and Drug Administration|FDA, United States Department of Energy|DOE, United States Department of Commerce|DOC, etc.), and the sheer infancy of NewSpace as an industry, it appears a comprehensive and Userfriendliness|userfriendly U.S. regulatory scheme has yet to be developed and put into place to the general satisfaction of NewSpace players:<ref name="Harrison">Cite web|url=http://breakingdefense.com/2016/07/commercial-space/|title=Commercial Space Needs Regulatory Clarity|last=Harrison|first=Todd|date=2016-07-26|website=breakingdefense.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309073616/http://breakingdefense.com/2016/07/commercial-space/|archive-date=9 March 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-03-08|df=dmy-all</ref><blockquote>Right now there are significant gaps in the U.S. government's regulatory authority and licensing process for newly emerging commercial space ventures [i.e., NewSpace firms and projects]. Processes exist for some ventures, but not for others. [...] In many cases, it's not clear what agency, if any, a commercial firm should go through to get approval. [...] The lack of clear rules, authorities, and process is needlessly driving up risk for these firms. Worse yet, it may lead some of them to move to countries where there is greater regulatory clarity or less oversight.<ref name="Harrison" />  </blockquote>
