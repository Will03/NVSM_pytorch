=Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz (1967–present)=
* Russian - three person Earth orbital spacecraft;<ref>Gatland, pp.148-165</ref> Early versions were operated by the Soviet Union and later versions by Russia after 1991. As of December 2018 Soyuz has made 139 crewed spaceflights, including two emergency sub-orbital flights, Soyuz 7K-T No.39|Soyuz 18a and Soyuz MS-10. There have been 2 accidental spacecraft losses resulting in the deaths of four cosmonauts, Soyuz 1 and Soyuz 11.
