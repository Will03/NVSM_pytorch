distinguish|Combinatoriality
Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite set|finite Mathematical structure|structures.  It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics, from evolutionary biology to computer science, etc.

To fully understand the scope of combinatorics requires a great deal of further amplification, the details of which are not universally agreed upon.<ref>cite web|first=Igor|last=Pak|title=What is Combinatorics?|url= //www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/hidden/papers/Quotes/Combinatorics-quotes.htm|access-date=1 November 2017</ref> According to H.J. Ryser, a definition of the subject is difficult because it crosses so many mathematical subdivisions.<ref>harvnb|Ryser|1963|loc=p. 2</ref> Insofar as an area can be described by the types of problems it addresses, combinatorics is involved with
* the ''enumeration'' (counting) of specified structures, sometimes referred to as arrangements or configurations in a very general sense, associated with finite systems,
* the ''existence'' of such structures that satisfy certain given criteria,
* the ''construction'' of these structures, perhaps in many ways, and
* ''optimization'', finding the "best" structure or solution among several possibilities, be it the "largest",  "smallest" or satisfying some other optimality criterion.

Leon Mirsky has said: "combinatorics is a range of linked studies which have something in common and yet diverge widely in their objectives, their methods, and the degree of coherence they have attained."<ref>citation|first=Leon|last=Mirsky|title=Book Review|journal=Bulletin (New Series) of the American Mathematical Society|volume=1|year=1979|url=//www.ams.org/journals/bull/1979-01-02/S0273-0979-1979-14606-8/S0273-0979-1979-14606-8.pdf|pages=380–388</ref> One way to define combinatorics is, perhaps, to describe its subdivisions with their problems and techniques. This is the approach that is used below. However, there are also purely historical reasons for including or not including some topics under the combinatorics umbrella.<ref>cite book|last1=Rota|first1=Gian Carlo|title=Discrete Thoughts|date=1969|publisher=Birkhaüser|page=50|quote=... combinatorial theory has been the mother of several of the more active branches of today's mathematics, which have become independent ... . The typical ... case of this is algebraic topology (formerly known as combinatorial topology)</ref> Although primarily concerned with finite systems, some combinatorial questions and techniques can be extended to an infinite (specifically, Countable set|countable) but Discrete mathematics|discrete setting.

Combinatorics is well known for the breadth of the problems it tackles. Combinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure mathematics, notably in algebra, probability theory, topology, and geometry,<ref>Björner and Stanley, p. 2</ref> as well as in its many application areas. Many combinatorial questions have historically been considered in isolation, giving an ''ad hoc'' solution to a problem arising in some mathematical context. In the later twentieth century, however, powerful and general theoretical methods were developed, making combinatorics into an independent branch of mathematics in its own right.<ref>cite book|last1=Lovász|first1=László|title=Combinatorial Problems and Exercises|date=1979|publisher=North-Holland|quote=In my opinion, combinatorics is now growing out of this early stage.</ref> One of the oldest and most accessible parts of combinatorics is graph theory, which by itself has numerous natural connections to other areas.  Combinatorics is used frequently in computer science to obtain formulas and estimates in the analysis of algorithms.

A mathematician who studies combinatorics is called a ''dfn|combinatorialist''.

main|History of combinatorics

Basic combinatorial concepts and enumerative results appeared throughout the Ancient history|ancient world. In the 6th century BCE, Timeline of Indian history|ancient Indian physician Sushruta asserts in Sushruta Samhita that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc., thus computing all 2<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 possibilities.  Ancient Greece|Greek historian Plutarch discusses an argument between Chrysippus (3rd century BCE) and Hipparchus (2nd century BCE) of a rather delicate enumerative problem, which was later shown to be related to Schröder–Hipparchus numbers.<ref>Richard P. Stanley|Stanley, Richard P.; "Hipparchus, Plutarch, Schröder, and Hough", ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 104 (1997), no. 4, 344–350.</ref><ref>Habsieger, Laurent; Kazarian, Maxim; and Lando, Sergei; "On the Second Number of Plutarch", ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 105 (1998), no. 5, 446.</ref> In the ''Ostomachion'', Archimedes (3rd century BCE) considers a tiling puzzle.

In the Middle Ages, combinatorics continued to be studied, largely outside of the Culture of Europe|European civilization.  The Indian mathematician Mahāvīra (mathematician)|Mahāvīra (c. 850) provided formulae for the number of permutations and combinations,<ref>MacTutor | id=Mahavira</ref><ref>Citation |last=Puttaswamy |first=Tumkur K. |contribution= The Mathematical Accomplishments of Ancient Indian Mathematicians |editor-last=Selin |editor-first=Helaine |title=Mathematics Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Mathematics |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |location=Netherlands |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hTyfurOH8AC&printsec=frontcover |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-4020-0260-1 |page=417 <!-- pages 409–422 --></ref> and these formulas may have been familiar to Indian mathematicians as early as the 6th century CE.<ref>cite journal | last1 = Biggs | first1 = Norman L. | year = 1979 | title = The Roots of Combinatorics | url = | journal = Historia Mathematica | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 109–136 | doi=10.1016/0315-0860(79)90074-0</ref>  The philosopher and astronomer Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (c. 1140) established the symmetry of binomial coefficients, while a closed formula was obtained later by the talmudist and mathematician Levi ben Gerson (better known as Gersonides), in 1321.<ref>citation|title=Probability Theory: A Historical Sketch|first=L.E.|last=Maistrov|publisher=Academic Press|year=1974|isbn=978-1-4832-1863-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZbiBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA35|page=35. (Translation from 1967 Russian ed.)</ref>
The arithmetical triangle— a graphical diagram showing relationships among the binomial coefficients— was presented by mathematicians in treatises dating as far back as the 10th century, and would eventually become known as Pascal's triangle. Later, in Medieval England, campanology provided examples of what is now known as Hamiltonian cycles in certain Cayley graphs on permutations.<ref>

During the Renaissance, together with the rest of mathematics and the sciences, combinatorics enjoyed a rebirth. Works of Blaise Pascal|Pascal, Isaac Newton|Newton, Jacob Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler|Euler became foundational in the emerging field. In modern times, the works of James Joseph Sylvester|J.J. Sylvester (late 19th century) and Percy Alexander MacMahon|Percy MacMahon (early 20th century) helped lay the foundation for Enumerative combinatorics|enumerative and algebraic combinatorics. Graph theory also enjoyed an explosion of interest at the same time, especially in connection with the four color problem.

In the second half of the 20th century, combinatorics enjoyed a rapid growth, which led to establishment of dozens of new journals and conferences in the subject.<ref>See [http://www.math.iit.edu/~kaul/Journals.html#CGT Journals in Combinatorics and Graph Theory]</ref> In part, the growth was spurred by new connections and applications to other fields, ranging from algebra to probability, from functional analysis to number theory, etc.  These connections shed the boundaries between combinatorics and parts of mathematics and theoretical computer science, but at the same time led to a partial fragmentation of the field.

 Approaches and subfields of combinatorics 

=Enumerative combinatorics=
Image:Catalan 4 leaves binary tree example.svg|320px|right|thumb|Five binary trees on three Vertex (graph theory)|vertices, an example of Catalan numbers.

main|Enumerative combinatorics

Enumerative combinatorics is the most classical area of combinatorics and concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects.  Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad mathematical problem, many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description. Fibonacci numbers is the basic example of a problem in enumerative combinatorics.  The twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations, combinations and Partition of a set|partitions.

=Analytic combinatorics=
Main|Analytic combinatorics
Analytic combinatorics concerns the enumeration of combinatorial structures using tools from complex analysis and probability theory.  In contrast with enumerative combinatorics, which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and generating functions to describe the results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic formulae.

= Partition theory =
Image:Partition3D.svg|150px|right|thumb|A plane partition.

main|Partition (number theory)|l1=Partition theory

Partition theory studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to integer partitions, and is closely related to q-series, special functions and orthogonal polynomials.  Originally a part of number theory and analysis, it is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field.  It incorporates the Bijective proof|bijective approach and various tools in analysis and analytic number theory, and has connections with statistical mechanics.

=Graph theory=
Image:Petersen1 tiny.svg|thumb|150px|Petersen graph.
main|Graph theory

Graphs are basic objects in combinatorics.  The questions range from counting (e.g., the number of graphs on ''n'' vertices with ''k'' edges) to structural (e.g., which graphs contain Hamiltonian cycles) to algebraic questions (e.g., given a graph ''G'' and two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', does the Tutte polynomial ''T''<sub>''G''</sub>(''x'',''y'') have a combinatorial interpretation?).  Although there are very strong connections between graph theory and combinatorics, these two are sometimes thought of as separate subjects.<ref>Sanders, Daniel P.; [http://www.math.gatech.edu/~sanders/graphtheory/writings/2-digit.html ''2-Digit MSC Comparison''] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231163112/http://www.math.gatech.edu/~sanders/graphtheory/writings/2-digit.html |date=2008-12-31 </ref>  This is due to the fact that while combinatorial methods apply to many graph theory problems, the two are generally used to seek solutions to different problems.

=Design theory=
main|Combinatorial design

Design theory is a study of combinatorial designs, which are collections of subsets with certain Set intersection|intersection properties. Block designs are combinatorial designs of a special type. This area is one of the oldest parts of combinatorics, such as in Kirkman's schoolgirl problem proposed in 1850. The solution of the problem is a special case of a Steiner system, which systems play an important role in the classification of finite simple groups. The area has further connections to coding theory and geometric combinatorics.

=Finite geometry=
main|Finite geometry

Finite geometry is the study of Geometry|geometric systems having only a finite number of points. Structures analogous to those found in continuous geometries (Euclidean plane, real projective space, etc.) but defined combinatorially are the main items studied. This area provides a rich source of examples for Combinatorial design|design theory. It should not be confused with discrete geometry (combinatorial geometry).

= Order theory =
Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|right|150px|Hasse diagram of the Power set|powerset of {x,y,z} ordered by Inclusion map|inclusion.

main|Order theory

Order theory is the study of partially ordered sets, both finite and infinite.  Various examples of partial orders appear in abstract algebra|algebra, geometry, number theory and throughout combinatorics and graph theory.  Notable classes and examples of partial orders include Lattice (order)|lattices and Boolean algebras.

=Matroid theory=
main|Matroid theory
Matroid theory abstracts part of geometry.   It studies the properties of sets (usually, finite sets) of vectors in a vector space that do not depend on the particular coefficients in a linear independence|linear dependence relation.  Not only the structure but also enumerative properties belong to matroid theory.  Matroid theory was introduced by Hassler Whitney and studied as a part of order theory.  It is now an independent field of study with a number of connections with other parts of combinatorics.

=Extremal combinatorics=
main|Extremal combinatorics

Extremal combinatorics studies extremal questions on set systems. The types of questions addressed in this case are about the largest possible graph which satisfies certain properties.  For example, the largest triangle-free graph on ''2n'' vertices is a complete bipartite graph ''K<sub>n,n</sub>''. Often it is too hard even to find the extremal answer ''f''(''n'') exactly and one can only give an asymptotic analysis|asymptotic estimate.

Ramsey theory is another part of extremal combinatorics.  It states that any sufficiently large configuration will contain some sort of order. It is an advanced generalization of the pigeonhole principle.

=Probabilistic combinatorics=
Image:Self avoiding walk.svg|thumb|right|150px|Self-avoiding walk in a Lattice graph|square grid graph.

main|Probabilistic method

In probabilistic combinatorics, the questions are of the following type: what is the probability of a certain property for a random discrete object, such as a random graph? For instance, what is the average number of triangles in a random graph? Probabilistic methods are also used to determine the existence of combinatorial objects with certain prescribed properties (for which explicit examples might be difficult to find), simply by observing that the probability of randomly selecting an object with those properties is greater than 0. This approach (often referred to as ''the'' probabilistic method) proved highly effective in applications to extremal combinatorics and graph theory. A closely related area is the study of finite Markov chains, especially on combinatorial objects. Here again probabilistic tools are used to estimate the Markov chain mixing time|mixing time.

Often associated with Paul Erdős, who did the pioneering work on the subject, probabilistic combinatorics was traditionally viewed as a set of tools to study problems in other parts of combinatorics. However, with the growth of applications to analysis of algorithms in computer science, as well as classical probability, Additive number theory|additive and probabilistic number theory, the area recently grew to become an independent field of combinatorics.

=Algebraic combinatorics=
Image:Young diagram for 541 partition.svg|thumb|right|150px|Young diagram of a Partition (number theory)|partition (5,4,1).
main|Algebraic combinatorics

Algebraic combinatorics is an area of mathematics that employs methods of abstract algebra, notably group theory and representation theory, in various combinatorial contexts and, conversely, applies combinatorial techniques to problems in abstract algebra|algebra. Algebraic combinatorics is continuously expanding its scope, in both topics and techniques, and can be seen as the area of mathematics where the interaction of combinatorial and algebraic methods is particularly strong and significant.

=Combinatorics on words=
Image:Morse-Thue sequence.gif|thumb|right|210px|Construction of a Thue–Morse sequence|Thue–Morse infinite word.

main|Combinatorics on words

Combinatorics on words deals with formal languages.  It  arose independently within several branches of mathematics, including number theory, group theory and probability. It has applications to enumerative combinatorics, fractal analysis, theoretical computer science, automata theory and linguistics.  While many applications are new, the classical Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy of classes of formal grammars is perhaps the best-known result in the field.

=Geometric combinatorics=
Image:Icosahedron.svg|150px|thumb|right|An icosahedron.

main|Geometric combinatorics

Geometric combinatorics is related to Convex geometry|convex and discrete geometry, in particular polyhedral combinatorics.  It asks, for example, how many faces of each dimension a convex polytope can have.  Metric geometry|Metric properties of polytopes play an important role as well, e.g. the   Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy theorem on the rigidity of convex polytopes.  Special polytopes are also considered, such as permutohedron|permutohedra, associahedron|associahedra and Birkhoff polytopes.  We should note that combinatorial geometry is an old fashioned name for discrete geometry.

=Topological combinatorics=
Image:Collier-de-perles-rouge-vert.svg|150px|thumb|right|Necklace splitting problem|Splitting a necklace with two cuts.
main|Topological combinatorics

Combinatorial analogs of concepts and methods in topology are used to study graph coloring, fair division, partition of a set|partitions, partially ordered sets, decision trees, necklace problems and discrete Morse theory.  It should not be confused with combinatorial topology which is an older name for algebraic topology.

=Arithmetic combinatorics=
main|Arithmetic combinatorics

Arithmetic combinatorics arose out of the interplay between number theory, combinatorics, ergodic theory and harmonic analysis. It is about combinatorial estimates associated with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Additive number theory (sometimes also called additive combinatorics) refers to the special case when only the operations of addition and subtraction are involved.  One important technique in arithmetic combinatorics is the ergodic theory of dynamical systems.

=Infinitary combinatorics=
main|Infinitary combinatorics

Infinitary combinatorics, or combinatorial set theory, is an extension of ideas in combinatorics to infinite sets.  It is a part of set theory, an area of mathematical logic, but uses tools and ideas from both set theory and extremal combinatorics.

Gian-Carlo Rota used the name ''continuous combinatorics''<ref>[http://faculty.uml.edu/dklain/cpc.pdf ''Continuous and profinite combinatorics'']</ref> to describe geometric probability, since there are many analogies between ''counting'' and ''measure''.

 Related fields 
Image:Kissing-3d.png|150px|right|thumb|kissing number|Kissing spheres are connected to both coding theory and discrete geometry.

= Combinatorial optimization =
Combinatorial optimization is the study of optimization on discrete and combinatorial objects. It started as a part of combinatorics and graph theory, but is now viewed as a branch of applied mathematics and computer science, related to operations research, Analysis of algorithms|algorithm theory and computational complexity theory.

= Coding theory =
Coding theory started as a part of design theory with early combinatorial constructions of error-correcting codes. The main idea of the subject is to design efficient and reliable methods of data transmission. It is now a large field of study, part of information theory.

= Discrete and computational geometry =
Discrete geometry (also called combinatorial geometry) also began as a part of combinatorics, with early results on convex polytopes and kissing numbers.  With the emergence of applications of discrete geometry to computational geometry, these two fields partially merged and became a separate field of study.  There remain many connections with geometric and topological combinatorics, which themselves can be viewed as outgrowths of the early discrete geometry.

=Combinatorics and dynamical systems=
Combinatorics and dynamical systems|Combinatorial aspects of dynamical systems is another emerging field.  Here dynamical systems can be defined on combinatorial objects.  See for example
graph dynamical system.

=Combinatorics and physics=
There are increasing interactions between combinatorics and physics, particularly statistical physics. Examples include an exact solution of the Ising model, and a connection between the Potts model on one hand, and the chromatic polynomial|chromatic and Tutte polynomials on the other hand.
