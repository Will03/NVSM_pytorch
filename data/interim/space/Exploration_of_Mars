Martian system
Main|Mars|Martian surface|Atmosphere of Mars|Moons of Mars
Mars has long been the subject of human interest. Early telescopic observations revealed color changes on the surface that were attributed to seasonal vegetation and apparent martian canal|linear features were ascribed to intelligent design. Further telescopic observations found two moons, Phobos (moon)|Phobos and Deimos (moon)|Deimos, polar ice caps and the feature now known as Olympus Mons, the solar system's tallest mountain.  The discoveries piqued further interest in the study and exploration of the red planet. Mars is a rocky planet, like Earth, that formed around the same time, yet with only half the diameter of Earth, and a far thinner atmosphere; it has a cold and desert-like surface.<ref>cite web | last=Sheehan | first=William | url=http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/mars/contents.htm | title= The Planet Mars: A History of Observation and Discovery | publisher = The University of Arizona Press, Tucson| year = 1996 | accessdate=2009-02-15</ref>

=1960s=
Between 1960 and 1969, the Soviet Union launched nine probes intended to reach Mars. They all failed: three at launch; three failed to reach near-Earth orbit; one during the burn to put the spacecraft into trans-Mars trajectory; and two during the interplanetary orbit.

The Mars 1M programs (sometimes dubbed Marsnik in Western media) was the first Soviet unmanned spacecraft interplanetary exploration program, which consisted of two flyby probes launched towards Mars in October 1960, Mars 1960A and Mars 1960B (also known as ''Korabl 4'' and ''Korabl 5'' respectively). After launch, the third stage pumps on both launchers were unable to develop enough pressure to commence ignition, so Earth parking orbit was not achieved. The spacecraft reached an altitude of 120&nbsp;km before reentry.

Sputnik 22|Mars 1962A was a Mars fly-by mission, launched on October 24, 1962 and Sputnik 24|Mars 1962B an intended first Mars lander (spacecraft)|lander mission, launched in late December of the same year (1962). Both failed from either breaking up as they were going into Earth orbit or having the upper stage explode in orbit during the burn to put the spacecraft into trans-Mars trajectory.<ref name=":0" />

Mars 1 (1962 Beta Nu 1), an automatic interplanetary spacecraft launched to Mars on November 1, 1962, was the first probe of the Soviet Mars probe program to achieve interplanetary orbit. Mars 1 was intended to fly by the planet at a distance of about 11,000&nbsp;km and take images of the surface as well as send back data on cosmic radiation, micrometeoroid impacts and Mars' magnetic field, radiation environment, atmospheric structure, and possible organic compounds.<ref name='Sputnik 23'>cite web | url = http://jtgnew.sjrdesign.net/exploration_space_planetary_mars.html | title = "Journey Through the Galaxy" Mars Program: Mars ~ 1960–1974 | accessdate = 2014-01-26 | last = Robbins | first = Stuart | year = 2008 | publisher = SJR Design</ref><ref name='Mihos 2006'>cite web|url=http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/advanced/20th_soviet_mars.html |title=Mars (1960–1974): Mars 1 |accessdate=2014-01-26 |last=Mihos |first=Chris |date=11 January 2006 |website=Department of Astronomy, Case Western Reserve University. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013211415/http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/advanced/20th_soviet_mars.html |archivedate=2013-10-13 |df= </ref> Sixty-one radio transmissions were held, initially at two-day intervals and later at 5 day intervals, from which a large amount of interplanetary data was collected.

In 1964, both Soviet probe launches, of Zond 1964A on June 4, and Zond 2 on November 30, (part of the Zond program), resulted in failures. Zond 1964A had a failure at launch, while communication was lost with Zond 2 en route to Mars after a mid-course maneuver, in early May 1965.<ref name=":0" />

In 1969, and as part of the Mars probe program, the Soviet Union prepared two identical 5-ton orbiters called M-69, dubbed by NASA as Mars 1969A and Mars 1969B.  Both probes were lost in launch-related complications with the newly developed Proton rocket.<ref>cite web | url= http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_mars.html | title= NASA A Chronology of Mars Exploration | accessdate=2007-03-28</ref>

=1970s=
The USSR intended to have the first artificial satellite of Mars beating the planned American Mariner 8 and Mariner 9 Mars orbiters. In May 1971, one day after Mariner 8 malfunctioned at launch and failed to reach orbit, Kosmos 419|Cosmos 419 (Mars 1971C), a heavy probe of the Soviet Mars program M-71, also failed to launch. This spacecraft was designed as an orbiter only, while the next two probes of project M-71, Mars 2 and Mars 3, were multipurpose combinations of an orbiter and a lander with small skis-walking rover (space exploration)|rovers that would be the first planet rovers outside the Moon. They were successfully launched in mid-May 1971 and reached Mars about seven months later. On November 27, 1971 the lander of Mars 2 Emergency landing|crash-landed due to an on-board computer malfunction and became the first man-made object to reach the surface of Mars. On 2 December 1971, the Mars 3 lander became the first spacecraft to achieve a Soft landing (rocketry)|soft landing, but its transmission was interrupted after 14.5 seconds.<ref name=Perminov1>cite book|last=Perminov|first=V.G.|title=The Difficult Road to Mars – A Brief History of Mars Exploration in the Soviet Union|year=July 1999|publisher=NASA Headquarters History Division|isbn=978-0-16-058859-4|page=58|url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph15.pdf</ref>

The Mars 2 and 3 orbiters sent back a relatively large volume of data covering the period from December 1971 to March 1972, although transmissions continued through to August. By 22 August 1972, after sending back data and a total of 60 pictures, Mars 2 and 3 concluded their missions. The images and data enabled creation of surface relief maps, and gave information on the Martian gravity and magnetic fields.<ref>cite web | url= http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1971-049A | title= NASA (NSSDC) Master Catalog Display Mars 3 | accessdate=2007-03-28</ref>

In 1973, the Soviet Union sent four more probes to Mars: the Mars program#Mars 4|Mars 4 and Mars program#Mars 5|Mars 5 orbiters and the Mars program#Mars 6|Mars 6 and Mars program#Mars 7|Mars 7 fly-by/lander combinations. All missions except Mars 7 sent back data, with Mars 5 being most successful. Mars 5 transmitted just 60 images before a loss of pressurization in the transmitter housing ended the mission. Mars 6 lander transmitted data during descent, but failed upon impact. Mars 4 flew by the planet at a range of 2200&nbsp;km returning one swath of pictures and radio occultation data, which constituted the first detection of the nightside ionosphere on Mars.<ref>cite web | url= http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1973-047A | title= NASA (NSSDC) Master Catalog Display Mars 4 | accessdate=2007-03-28</ref> Mars 7 probe separated prematurely from the carrying vehicle due to a problem in the operation of one of the onboard systems (attitude control or retro-rockets) and missed the planet by convert|1300|km|au.citation needed|date=December 2015

File:Mars (Mariner 4).jpg|thumb|150px|The first close-up images taken of Mars in 1965 from Mariner 4 show an area about 330 km across by 1200 km from limb to bottom of frame.

In 1964, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory made two attempts at reaching Mars. Mariner 3 and Mariner 4 were identical spacecraft designed to carry out the first flybys of Mars. Mariner 3 was launched on November 5, 1964, but the shroud encasing the spacecraft atop its rocket failed to open properly, dooming the mission. Three weeks later, on November 28, 1964, Mariner 4 was launched successfully on a 7½-month voyage to Mars..citation needed|date=December 2015

Mariner 4 flew past Mars on July 14, 1965, providing the first close-up photographs of another planet. The pictures, gradually played back to Earth from a small tape recorder on the probe, showed impact craters.  It provided radically more accurate data about the planet; a surface atmospheric pressure of about 1% of Earth's and daytime temperatures of −100&nbsp;°C (−148&nbsp;°F) were estimated.

NASA continued the Mariner program with another pair of Mars flyby probes, Mariner 6 and 7. They were sent at the next launch window, and reached the planet in 1969. During the following launch window the Mariner program again suffered the loss of one of a pair of probes. Mariner 9 successfully entered orbit about Mars, the first spacecraft ever to do so, after the launch time failure of its sister ship, Mariner 8.  When Mariner 9 reached Mars in 1971, it and two Soviet orbiters (Mars 2 and Mars 3, see ''Mars probe program'' above) found that a planet-wide dust storm was in progress.  The mission controllers used the time spent waiting for the storm to clear to have the probe rendezvous with, and photograph, Phobos (moon)|Phobos.  When the storm cleared sufficiently for Mars' surface to be photographed by Mariner 9, the pictures returned represented a substantial advance over previous missions.  These pictures were the first to offer more detailed evidence that liquid water might at one time have flowed on the planetary surface. They also finally discerned the true nature of many Martian albedo features. For example, Nix Olympica was one of only a few features that could be seen during the planetary duststorm, revealing it to be the List of tallest mountains in the Solar System|highest mountain (volcano, to be exact) on any planet in the entire Solar System, and leading to its reclassification as Olympus Mons.citation needed|date=December 2015

After the 1992 failure of NASA's Mars Observer orbiter, NASA retooled and launched Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).  Mars Global Surveyor launched on November 7, 1996, and entered orbit on September 12, 1997. After a year and a half trimming its orbit from a looping ellipse to a circular track around the planet, the spacecraft began its primary mapping mission in March 1999. It observed the planet from a low-altitude, nearly polar orbit over the course of one complete Martian year, the equivalent of nearly two Earth years. Mars Global Surveyor completed its primary mission on January 31, 2001, and completed several extended mission phases.citation needed|date=December 2015

The mission studied the entire Martian surface, atmosphere, and interior, and returned more data about the red planet than all previous Mars missions combined. The data has been archived and remains available publicly.<ref>cite web | url=http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mgs/ | title=PDS Geosciences Node Data and Services: MGS | accessdate=2006-08-27</ref>

Map location is in Lunae Palus quadrangle and includes parts of Lunae Planum and Chryse Planitia.|A color-coded elevation map produced from data collected by Mars Global Surveyor indicating the result of floods on Mars.
Among key scientific findings, Global Surveyor took pictures of gullies and debris flow features that suggest there may be current sources of liquid water, similar to an aquifer, at or near the surface of the planet.  Similar channels on Earth are formed by flowing water, but on Mars the temperature is normally too cold and the atmosphere too thin to sustain liquid water. Nevertheless, many scientists hypothesize that liquid groundwater can sometimes surface on Mars, erode gullies and channels, and pool at the bottom before freezing and evaporating.citation needed|date=December 2015

Magnetometer readings showed that the planet's magnetic field is not globally generated in the planet's core, but is localized in particular areas of the crust. New temperature data and closeup images of the Martian moon Phobos showed that its surface is composed of powdery material at least 1 metre (3&nbsp;feet) thick, caused by millions of years of meteoroid impacts. Data from the spacecraft's laser altimeter gave scientists their first 3-D views of Mars' north polar ice cap.citation needed|date=December 2015

In 2001, NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter arrived at Mars. Its mission is to use spectrometers and imagers to hunt for evidence of past or present water and volcanic activity on Mars. In 2002, it was announced that the probe's gamma-ray spectrometer and neutron spectrometer had detected large amounts of hydrogen, indicating that there are vast deposits of water ice in the upper three meters of Mars' soil within 60° latitude of the south pole.Citation needed|date=August 2012

On June 2, 2003, the European Space Agency's Mars Express set off from Baikonur Cosmodrome to Mars. The Mars Express craft consists of the Mars Express Orbiter and the stationary lander Beagle 2. The lander carried a digging device and the smallest mass spectrometer created to date, as well as a range of other devices, on a robotic arm in order to accurately analyze soil beneath the dusty surface to look for biosignatures and biomolecules.citation needed|date=December 2015

The orbiter entered Mars orbit on December 25, 2003, and Beagle 2 entered Mars' atmosphere the same day. However, attempts to contact the lander failed. Communications attempts continued throughout January, but Beagle 2 was declared lost in mid-February, and a joint inquiry was launched by the UK and ESA. The Mars Express Orbiter confirmed the presence of water ice and carbon dioxide ice at the planet's south pole, while NASA had previously confirmed their presence at the north pole of Mars.citation needed|date=December 2015

The lander's fate remained a mystery until it was located intact on the surface of Mars in a series of images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.<ref name="NASA-20150116">cite web |last=Webster |first=Guy |title='Lost' 2003 Mars Lander Found by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter |url=http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/lost-2003-mars-lander-found-by-mars-reconnaissance-orbiter/ |date=16 January 2015 |website=NASA |accessdate=16 January 2015 </ref><ref name="NYT-20150116">cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Mars Orbiter Spots Beagle 2, European Lander Missing Since 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/science/space/missing-lander-beagle-2-finally-located-on-mars.html |date=16 January 2015 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2015-01-17</ref> The images suggest that two of the spacecraft's four solar panels failed to deploy, blocking the spacecraft's communications antenna.

The ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'' (MRO) is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of Mars from orbit. The $720 million USD spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin under the supervision of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, launched August 12, 2005, and entered Mars orbit on March 10, 2006.<ref name="spaceflightnow1">cite web| url=http://spaceflightnow.com/mars/mro/status.html| title="Spaceflight Now" MRO Mission Status Center| accessdate =23 October 2016 </ref>

The MRO contains a host of scientific instruments such as the HiRISE camera, CTX camera, CRISM, and SHARAD. The HiRISE camera is used to analyze Martian landforms, whereas CRISM and SHARAD can detect water, ice, and minerals on and below the surface.  Additionally, MRO is paving the way for upcoming generations of spacecraft through daily monitoring of Martian weather and surface conditions, searching for future landing sites, and testing a new telecommunications system that enable it to send and receive information at an unprecedented bitrate, compared to previous Mars spacecraft. Data transfer to and from the spacecraft occurs faster than all previous interplanetary missions combined and allows it to serve as an important relay satellite for other missions.citation needed|date=December 2015

Human mission proposals

Main|Human mission to Mars
Many people have long advocated a human mission to Mars, perhaps eventually leading to the permanent colonization of Mars, as the next logical step for a human space program after lunar exploration.  Aside from the prestige such a mission would bring, advocates argue that humans would easily be able to outperform robotic explorers, justifying the expense. Aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin|Bob Zubrin is one of the proponents of such missions. Various Asteroid|asteroids, moons, and places on Mars can be mined while crops are initially being planted.<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/09/26/is-there-a-fortune-to-be-made-on-mars/|title=Is There A Fortune To Be Made On Mars?|last=Forbes|first=|date=|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en</ref> This method will save lives on Earth, add potentially trillion (short scale)|trillions of Dollar|dollars to the world economy annually, and provide a stable colony on Mars. Some have also stated that persons should stay on Earth, but get food and resources from Mars and surrounding asteroids, moons, greenhouses in space and other structures. Some critics contend unmanned robots can perform better than humans at a fraction of the expense. If life exists on Mars, a human mission could contaminate it by introducing earthly microbes, so robotic exploration would be preferable.<ref>Lupisella, ML.

On October 8, 2015, NASA published its official plan for human exploration and colonization of Mars. They called it "Journey to Mars". The plan operates through three distinct phases leading up to fully sustained colonization.<ref>Cite web|title = NASA Releases Plan Outlining Next Steps in the Journey to Mars|url = http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-releases-plan-outlining-next-steps-in-the-journey-to-mars|website = NASA|accessdate = 2015-10-12|first = Erin|last = Mahoney|date = 2015-09-24</ref> 
* The first stage, already underway, is the "Earth Reliant" phase.  This phase continues utilizing the International Space Station until 2024; validating deep space technologies and studying the effects of long duration space missions on the human body.  
* The second stage, "Proving Ground," moves away from Earth reliance and ventures into cislunar space for most of its tasks.  This is when NASA plans to capture an asteroid (planned for 2020), test deep space habitation facilities, and validate capabilities required for human exploration of Mars.  Finally, phase three is the transition to independence from Earth resources.  
* The last stage, the "Earth Independent" phase, includes long term missions on the lunar surface which leverage surface habitats that only require routine maintenance, and the harvesting of Martian resources for fuel, water, and building materials.  NASA is still aiming for human missions to Mars in the 2030s, though Earth independence could take decades longer.<ref>Cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/journey-to-mars-next-steps-20151008_508.pdf|title = NASA's Journey To Mars: Pioneering Next Steps in Space Exploration|date = October 8, 2015|accessdate = October 10, 2015|website = www.nasa.gov|publisher = NASA</ref>

On August 28, 2015, NASA funded a year long simulation to study the effects of a year long Mars mission on six scientists. The scientists lived in a bio dome on a Mauna Loa mountain in Hawaii with limited connection to the outside world and were only allowed outside if they were wearing spacesuits.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/28/health/mars-simulation-hawaii/index.html|title=Mars simulation crew 'return to Earth' after 365 days in isolation|last=CNN|first=James Griffiths|website=CNN|access-date=2016-08-29</ref><ref>Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/28/mars-scientists-nasa-dome-hawaii-mountain-isolation|title=Mars scientists leave dome on Hawaii mountain after year in isolation|last=Slawson|first=Nicola|date=2016-08-28|last2=agencies|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-29</ref>

NASAs human Mars exploration plans have evolved through the NASA Mars Design Reference Missions, a series of design studies for human exploration of Mars.

Mars Direct, a low-cost human mission proposed by Robert Zubrin, founder of the Mars Society, would use heavy-lift Saturn V class rockets, such as the Ares V, to skip orbital construction, LEO rendezvous, and lunar fuel depots. A modified proposal, called "Mars to Stay", involves not returning the first immigrant explorers immediately, if ever (see Colonization of Mars).<ref name="britt_bush_vision">cite web|first=Robert|last=Britt|url=http://www.space.com/news/bush_plan_faq_040115.html#whenmars|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209192146/http://www.space.com/news/bush_plan_faq_040115.html#whenmars|archivedate=2006-02-09|title=When do we get to Mars?|website=Space.com FAQ: Bush's New Space Vision|accessdate=2006-06-13</ref><ref name="mars_daily">cite news|url=http://www.marsdaily.com/reports/NASA_aims_to_put_man_on_Mars_by_2037_999.html|agency=AFP|title=NASA aims to put man on Mars by 2037</ref><ref name=marshome/><ref name="marshome">cite web|url=http://www.marshome.org/|title=The Mars Homestead Project—Arrive, Survive, & Thrive!|publisher=Marshome.org|accessdate=2009-09-20</ref>

The challenge, complexity and length of Mars missions have led to many mission failures.<ref name=universetoday>[http://www.universetoday.com/2008/03/22/the-mars-curse-why-have-so-many-missions-failed/ The "Mars Curse": Why Have So Many Missions Failed?].

Two Soviet probes were sent to Mars in 1988 as part of the Phobos program. Phobos 1 operated normally until an expected communications session on 2 September 1988 failed to occur. The problem was traced to a software error, which deactivated attitude thrusters causing the spacecrafts' solar arrays to no longer point at the Sun, depleting Phobos 1 batteries. Phobos 2 operated normally throughout its cruise and Mars orbital insertion phases on January 29, 1989, gathering data on the Sun, interplanetary medium, Mars, and Phobos. Shortly before the final phase of the mission, during which the spacecraft was to approach within 50 m of Phobos' surface and release two landers, one a mobile 'hopper', the other a stationary platform, contact with Phobos 2 was lost. The mission ended when the spacecraft signal failed to be successfully reacquired on March 27, 1989. The cause of the failure was determined to be a malfunction of the on-board computer.citation needed|date=August 2012

Just a few years later in 1992 Mars Observer, launched by NASA, failed as it approached Mars. Mars 96, an orbiter launched on November 16, 1996 by Russia failed, when the planned second burn of the Block D-2 fourth stage did not occur.<ref>cite web |author=Igor Lissov, with comments from Jim Oberg |title=What Really Happened With Mars-96? |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |url=http://www.fas.org/spp/eprint/mars96lo.htm |date=1996-09-19 |accessdate=2012-08-20</ref>

Following the success of Global Surveyor and Pathfinder, another spate of failures occurred in 1998 and 1999, with the Japanese Nozomi (probe)|Nozomi orbiter and NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter, Mars Polar Lander, and Deep Space 2 penetrators all suffering various fatal errors. The Mars Climate Orbiter was noted for mixing up U.S. customary units with metric system|metric units, causing the orbiter to burn up while entering Mars' atmosphere.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9909/30/mars.metric.02/index.html|title=CNN – Metric mishap caused loss of NASA orbiter – September 30, 1999|website=cnn.com|accessdate=9 February 2017</ref>

The European Space Agency has also attempted to land two probes on the Martian surface; Beagle 2, a British-built lander that failed to deploy its solar arrays properly after touchdown in December 2003, and Schiaparelli EDM lander|''Schiaparelli'', which was flown along the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. Contact with the ''Schiaparelli'' EDM lander was lost 50 seconds before touchdown.<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37715202|title=Schiaparelli Mars probe's parachute 'jettisoned too early'|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=2016-10-20|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-20</ref> It was later confirmed that the lander struck the surface at a high velocity, possibly exploding.<ref name="edmlandingcrash">cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21132 |title=Space Images &#124; Schiaparelli Impact Site on Mars, in Color |website=Jpl.nasa.gov |date=2016-10-19 |accessdate=2016-11-04</ref>

Notes
:note|active|α The diagram includes missions that are active on the surface, such as operational rovers and landers, as well as probes in Mars orbit. The diagram does not include missions that are en-route to Mars, or probes that have previously performed a fly-by of Mars and moved on. The two probes of the Mars Cube One mission are counted as a single mission.
