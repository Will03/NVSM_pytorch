Image:Interplanetary Superhighway.jpg|thumb|350px|This stylized depiction of the ITN is designed to show its (often convoluted) path through the Solar System. The green ribbon represents one path from among the many that are mathematically possible along the surface of the darker green bounding tube. Locations where the ribbon changes direction abruptly represent trajectory changes at Lagrange points, while constricted areas represent locations where objects linger in temporary orbit around a point before continuing on.

The Interplanetary Transport Network (ITN)<ref>cite journal |last=Ross |url=http://www2.esm.vt.edu/~sdross/papers/AmericanScientist2006.pdf|first=S. D. |date=2006 |doi=10.1511/2006.59.994 |title=The Interplanetary Transport Network |journal=American Scientist |volume=94 |issue= |pages=230–237 </ref> is a collection of gravitationally determined pathways through the Solar System that require very little energy for an object to follow.  The ITN makes particular use of Lagrange points as locations where trajectories through Outer space|space are redirected using little or no energy. These points have the peculiar property of allowing objects to orbit around them, despite lacking an object to orbit. While they use little energy, the transport can take a very long time. Shane D. Ross|Shane Ross has said "Due to the long time needed to achieve the low energy transfers between planets, the Interplanetary Superhighway is impractical for transfers such as from Earth to Mars at present."<ref>[http://www2.esm.vt.edu/~sdross/superhighway/description.html The Interplanetary Superhighway; Shane Ross; Virginia Tech.]</ref>

History
Interplanetary transfer orbits are solutions to the gravitational "restricted three-body problem", which, for the general case, does not have exact solutions, and is addressed by numerical analysis approximations. However, a small number of exact solutions exist, most notably the five orbits referred to as "Lagrange points", which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one body is significantly more massive.

The key to discovering the Interplanetary Transport Network was the investigation of the nature of the winding paths near the Earth-Sun and Earth-Moon Lagrange points. They were first investigated by Jules-Henri Poincaré in the 1890s. He noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle, for a time, on an orbit about that point.<ref>cite journal |last=Marsden |first=J. E. |first2=S. D. |last2=Ross |date=2006 |doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-05-01085-2 |title=New methods in celestial mechanics and mission design |journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. |volume=43 |issue= |pages=43–73 </ref> There are in fact an Cardinality of the continuum|infinite number of paths taking one to the point and away from it, and all of which require nearly zero change in energy to reach. When plotted, they form a tube with the orbit about the Lagrange point at one end.

The derivation of these paths traces back to mathematicians Charles C. Conley and Richard P. McGehee in 1968.<ref name="Conley, C. C 1968">cite journal |last=Conley |first=C. C. |date=1968 |title=Low energy transit orbits in the restricted three-body problem |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics |volume=16 |issue= |pages=732–746 |doi= 10.1137/0116060|jstor=2099124 </ref>  ''Hiten'', Japan's first lunar probe, was moved into lunar orbit using similar insight into the nature of paths between the Earth and the Moon.  Beginning in 1997, Martin Lo, Shane D. Ross, and others wrote a series of papers identifying the mathematical basis that applied the technique to the Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis solar wind sample return, and to Lunar and Jupiter|Jovian missions.  They referred to it as an Interplanetary Superhighway (IPS).<ref>Lo, Martin W. and Ross, Shane D.

Paths
As it turns out, it is very easy to transit from a path leading to the point to one leading back out. This makes sense, since the orbit is unstable, which implies one will eventually end up on one of the outbound paths after spending no energy at all. Edward Belbruno coined the term "weak stability boundary"<ref name="Belbruno2000">cite web|author1=Edward A. Belbruno  |author2=John P. Carrico |title=Calculation of Weak Stability Boundary Ballistic Lunar Transfer Trajectories|url=http://astrogatorsguild.com/wp-content/papers/0800_wsb.pdf|publisher=AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference|date=2000</ref> or "fuzzy boundary"<ref name="Frank">cite journal|last=Frank|first=Adam|date=September 1994|title=Gravity's Rim|journal=Discover (magazine)|Discover|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/sep/gravitysrim419/ |access-date=29 August 2017</ref> for this effect.

With careful calculation, one can pick ''which'' outbound path one wants. This turned out to be useful, as many of these paths lead to some interesting points in space, such as the Earth's Moon or between the Galilean moons of Jupiter.<ref>Ross, S.D., W.S. Koon, M.W. Lo and J.E. Marsden (2003) [http://www.esm.vt.edu/~sdross/papers/AAS-03-143.pdf Design of a Multi-Moon Orbiter] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108230403/http://www.esm.vt.edu/~sdross/papers/AAS-03-143.pdf |date=2007-01-08 . 13th AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting, Ponce, Puerto Rico, Paper No. AAS 03–143.</ref> As a result, for the cost of reaching the Earth–Sun L2 point, which is rather low energy value, one can travel to a number of very interesting points for a little or no additional fuel cost. But the trip from Earth to Mars or other distant location would likely take thousands of years.

The transfers are so low-energy that they make travel to almost any point in the Solar System possible. citation needed|reason=I believe there are no tubes linking the Sun-Earth Lagrange points with Sun mars Lagrange points. Nor Earth to Venus. Nor Earth to Mercury. The small rocky planets has very small mass parameters and there aren't a huge number of paths from the sun-rocky planet L1 and L2 regions |date=November 2015 On the downside, these transfers are very slow. For trips from Earth to other planets, they are not useful for manned or unmanned probes, as the trip would take many generations. Nevertheless, they have already been used to transfer spacecraft to the Earth–Sun L1 point, a useful point for studying the Sun that was employed in a number of recent missions, including the Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis mission, the first to return solar wind samples to Earth.<ref>Lo, M.

=Further explanation=
The ITN is based around a series of orbital paths predicted by chaos theory and the restricted three-body problem leading to and from the unstable orbits around the Lagrange points – points in space where the gravity between various bodies balances with the centrifugal force of an object there. For any two bodies in which one body orbits around the other, such as a star/planet or planet/moon system, there are five such points, denoted L1 through L5. For instance, the Earth–Moon L1 point lies on a line between the two, where gravitational forces between them exactly balance with the centrifugal force of an object placed in orbit there. For two bodies whose ratio of masses exceeds 24.96,<ref name="cornish">cite web|url= http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/ContentMedia/lagrange.pdf |title=The Lagrange Points , Neil J. Cornish with input from Jeremy Goodman</ref> there are two stable points denoted as L4 and L5. These five points have particularly low delta-v requirements, and appear to be the lowest-energy transfers possible, even lower than the common Hohmann transfer orbit that has dominated orbital navigation since the start of space travel.

Although the forces balance at these points, the first three points (the ones on the line between a certain large mass, e.g. a star, and a smaller, orbiting mass, e.g. a planet) are not stable Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium points. If a spacecraft placed at the Earth–Moon L1 point is given even a slight nudge towards the Moon, for instance, the Moon's gravity will now be greater and the spacecraft will be pulled away from the L1 point. The entire system is in motion, so the spacecraft will not actually hit the Moon, but will travel in a winding path, off into space. There is, however, a semi-stable orbit around each of these points, called a halo orbit. The orbits for two of the points, L4 and L5, are stable, but the halo orbits for L1 through L3 are stable only on the order of months.

In addition to orbits around Lagrange points, the rich dynamics that arise from the gravitational pull of more than one mass yield interesting trajectories, also known as low energy transfers.<ref name="Conley, C. C 1968"/> For example, the gravity environment of the Sun–Earth–Moon system allows spacecraft to travel great distances on very little fuel citation needed|reason=From LEO, 3.2 km/s suffices for escape. To reach Sun earth L1, 3.1 km/s needs to be invested. the fuel savings isn't that great|date=November 2015, albeit on an often circuitous route.

Missions
Launched in 1978, the ISEE-3 spacecraft was sent on a mission to orbit around one of the Lagrange points.<ref>cite journal |last=Farquhar |first=R. W. |first2=D. P. |last2=Muhonen |first3=C. |last3=Newman |first4=H. |last4=Heuberger |date=1980 |title=Trajectories and Orbital Maneuvers for the First Libration-Point Satellite |journal=Journal of Guidance and Control |volume=3 |issue= |pages=549–554 |doi= 10.2514/3.56034|bibcode = 1980JGCD....3..549F </ref> The spacecraft was able to maneuver around the Earth's neighborhood using little fuel by taking advantage of the unique gravity environment. After the primary mission was completed, ISEE-3 went on to accomplish other goals, including a flight through the geomagnetic tail and a comet flyby. The mission was subsequently renamed the International Cometary Explorer (ICE).

The first low energy transfer using what would later be called the ITN was the rescue of Japan's ''Hiten'' lunar mission in 1991.<ref>cite book |last=Belbruno |first=E. |date=2004 |url=http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7687.html |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics: With the Construction of Low Energy Transfers |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |isbn=9780691094809 </ref> Another example of the use of the ITN was NASA's 2001–2003 Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis mission, which orbited the Sun–Earth L1 point for over two years collecting material, before being redirected to the L2 Lagrange point, and finally redirected from there back to Earth. The 2003–2006 ''SMART-1'' of the European Space Agency used another low energy transfer from the ITN. In a more recent example, the China space program|Chinese spacecraft Chang'e 2 used the ITN to travel from lunar orbit to the Earth-Sun L2 point, then on to fly by the asteroid 4179 Toutatis.
