''Quantum Aspects of Life'' is a 2008 science text, with a foreword by Roger Penrose, which explores the open question of the role of quantum mechanics at molecular scales of relevance to biology. The book adopts a debate-like style and contains chapters written by various world-experts; giving rise to a mix of both sceptical and sympathetic viewpoints. The book addresses questions of quantum physics, biophysics, nanoscience, quantum chemistry, mathematical biology, complex systems|complexity theory, and philosophy that are inspired by the 1944 seminal book ''What Is Life?'' by Erwin Schrödinger.
