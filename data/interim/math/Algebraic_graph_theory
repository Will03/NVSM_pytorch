Algebraic graph theory is a branch of mathematics in which algebraic methods are applied to problems about Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs. This is in contrast to geometric graph theory|geometric, combinatorics#Graph theory|combinatoric, or algorithmic graph theory|algorithmic approaches.  There are three main branches of algebraic graph theory, involving the use of linear algebra, the use of group theory, and the study of graph property|graph invariants.

Branches of algebraic graph theory
= Using linear algebra =
The first branch of algebraic graph theory involves the study of graphs in connection with linear algebra. Especially, it studies the Eigendecomposition of a matrix|spectrum of the adjacency matrix, or the Laplacian matrix of a graph (this part of algebraic graph theory is also called spectral graph theory).  For the Petersen graph, for example, the spectrum of the adjacency matrix is (−2,&nbsp;−2,&nbsp;−2,&nbsp;−2,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;3). Several theorems relate properties of the spectrum to other graph property|graph properties.  As a simple example, a connectivity (graph theory)|connected graph with Distance (graph theory)|diameter ''D'' will have at least ''D''+1 distinct values in its spectrum.<ref name="biggs">Citation | author=Biggs, Norman | title=Algebraic Graph Theory | edition=2nd | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1993 | isbn=0-521-45897-8 | postscript=<!--none--></ref> Algebraic connectivity|Aspects of graph spectra have been used in analysing the synchronizability of Network theory|networks.

=Using group theory=
Graph families defined by their automorphisms
The second branch of algebraic graph theory involves the study of graphs in connection to group theory, particularly Graph automorphism|automorphism groups and geometric group theory. The focus is placed on various families of graphs based on symmetry (such as symmetric graphs, vertex-transitive graphs, edge-transitive graphs, distance-transitive graphs, distance-regular graphs, and strongly regular graphs), and on the inclusion relationships between these families. Certain of such categories of graphs are sparse enough that Foster census|lists of graphs can be drawn up. By Frucht's theorem, all group (mathematics)|groups can be represented as the automorphism group of a connected graph (indeed, of a cubic graph).<ref>R. Frucht. Graphs of Degree 3 with given abstract group, Can. J. Math. 3 1949.</ref> Another connection with group theory is that, given any group, symmetrical graphs known as Cayley graphs can be generated, and these have properties related to the structure of the group.<ref name="biggs" />

All Cayley graphs are vertex-transitive graph|vertex-transitive, but some vertex-transitive graphs (like the Petersen graph) are not Cayley graphs.

This second branch of algebraic graph theory is related to the first, since the symmetry properties of a graph are reflected in its spectrum. In particular, the spectrum of a highly symmetrical graph, such as the Petersen graph, has few distinct values<ref name="biggs" /> (the Petersen graph has 3, which is the minimum possible, given its diameter). For Cayley graphs, the spectrum can be related directly to the structure of the group, in particular to its character theory|irreducible characters.<ref name="biggs" /><ref name="babai">*Citation | first = L | last = Babai | editor-last = Graham | editor-first = R | editor2-last = Grötschel | editor2-first = M | editor2-link = Martin Grötschel | editor3-last = Lovász | editor3-first = L | title = Handbook of Combinatorics | contribution = Automorphism groups, isomorphism, reconstruction | contribution-url = http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-94-10.ps | year = 1996 | publisher = Elsevier | postscript = <!--none--></ref>

=Studying graph invariants=
Finally, the third branch of algebraic graph theory concerns algebraic properties of graph property|invariants of graphs, and especially the chromatic polynomial, the Tutte polynomial and knot invariants. The chromatic polynomial of a graph, for example, counts the number of its proper vertex colorings.  For the Petersen graph, this polynomial is <math>t(t-1)(t-2)(t^7-12t^6+67t^5-230t^4+529t^3-814t^2+775t-352)</math>.<ref name="biggs" /> In particular, this means that the Petersen graph cannot be properly colored with one or two colors, but can be colored in 120 different ways with 3 colors.  Much work in this area of algebraic graph theory was motivated by attempts to prove the four color theorem. However, there are still many Graph coloring#Open problems|open problems, such as characterizing graphs which have the same chromatic polynomial, and determining which polynomials are chromatic.
