In mathematics, spectral graph theory is the study of the properties of a Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph in relationship to the characteristic polynomial, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of matrices associated with the graph, such as its adjacency matrix or Laplacian matrix.

The adjacency matrix of a undirected graph|simple graph is a Real number|real symmetric matrix and is therefore Orthogonal diagonalization|orthogonally diagonalizable; its eigenvalues are real algebraic integers.

While the adjacency matrix depends on the vertex labeling, its Spectrum of a matrix|spectrum is a graph invariant, although not a complete one.

Spectral graph theory is also concerned with graph parameters that are defined via multiplicities of eigenvalues of matrices associated to the graph, such as the Colin de Verdière graph invariant|Colin de Verdière number.

Cospectral graphs
Two graphs are called cospectral or isospectral if the adjacency matrices of the graphs have equal multisets of eigenvalues.

Cospectral graphs need not be Graph isomorphism|isomorphic, but isomorphic graphs are always cospectral.

= Graphs determined by their spectrum =
A graph <math>G</math> is said to be determined by its spectrum if any other graph with the same spectrum as <math>G</math> is isomorphic to <math>G</math>.

Some first examples of families of graphs that are determined by their spectrum include:
* The complete graphs.
* The finite starlike trees.

= Cospectral mates =
A pair of graphs are said to be cospectral mates if they have the same spectrum, but are non-isomorphic.

The smallest pair of cospectral mates is {''K''<sub>1,4</sub>, ''C''<sub>4</sub> U ''K''<sub>1</sub>}, comprising the 5-vertex star (graph theory)|star and the graph union of the 4-vertex cycle (graph theory)|cycle and the single-vertex graph, as reported by Collatz and Sinogowitz<ref>Collatz, L. and Sinogowitz, U. "Spektren endlicher Grafen." Abh. Math. Sem. Univ. Hamburg 21, 63&#x2013;77, 1957.</ref><ref>mathworld|CospectralGraphs|Cospectral Graphs</ref> in 1957.

The smallest pair of polyhedral graph|polyhedral cospectral mates are enneahedron|enneahedra with eight vertices each.<ref>citation|title=Topological twin graphs. Smallest pair of isospectral polyhedral graphs with eight vertices|year=1994|last1=Hosoya|last2=Nagashima|last3=Hyugaji|first1=Haruo|first2=Umpei|first3=Sachiko|author1-link=Haruo Hosoya|journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling|volume=34|issue=2|pages=428–431|doi=10.1021/ci00018a033.</ref>

= Finding cospectral graphs =
Almost all tree (graph theory)|trees are cospectral, i.e., the share of cospectral trees on ''n'' vertices tends to 1 as ''n'' grows.<ref>A. J. Schwenk|Schwenk, A. J. "Almost All Trees are Cospectral"  In:
''New Directions in the Theory of Graphs'' (F. Harary, Ed.), Academic Press, New York, 1973, pp. 275&#x2013;307.</ref>

A pair of regular graphs are cospectral if and only if their complements are cospectral.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cgodsil/pdfs/cospectral.pdf|title=Are Almost All Graphs Cospectral?|last=Godsil|first=Chris|date=November 7, 2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=</ref>

A pair of distance-regular graphs are cospectral if and only if they have the same intersection array.

Cospectral graphs can also be constructed by means of the isospectral|Sunada method.<ref>citation

Another important source of cospectral graphs are the point-collinearity graphs and the line-intersection graphs of incidence geometry|point-line geometries. These graphs are always cospectral but are often non-isomorphic.<ref>cite web| first1=Andries |last1=Brouwer| first2 = Willem H. | last2 = Haemers| url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/2WF02/spectra.pdf |title=Spectra of Graphs |year=2011</ref>

Cheeger inequality
The famous Cheeger constant#Cheeger.27s inequality|Cheeger's inequality from Riemannian geometry has a discrete analogue involving the Laplacian matrix; this is perhaps the most important theorem in spectral graph theory and one of the most useful facts in algorithmic applications. It approximates the sparsest cut of a graph through the second eigenvalue of its Laplacian.

=Cheeger constant=
main|Cheeger constant (graph theory)
The Cheeger constant (also Cheeger number or isoperimetric number) of a Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph is a numerical measure of whether or not a graph has a "bottleneck". The Cheeger constant as a measure of "bottleneckedness" is of great interest in many areas: for example, constructing well-connected Computer networking|networks of computers, Shuffling|card shuffling, and Geometric topology|low-dimensional topology (in particular, the study of Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic 3-manifolds).

More formally, the Cheeger constant ''h''(''G'') of a graph ''G'' on ''n'' vertices is defined as
: <math>h(G) = \min_{0 < |S| \le \frac{n}{2} } \frac{|\partial(S)|}{|S|},</math>
where the minimum is over all nonempty sets ''S'' of at most ''n''/2 vertices and ∂(''S'') is the ''edge boundary'' of ''S'', i.e., the set of edges with exactly one endpoint in ''S''.<ref>Definition 2.1 in harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006</ref>

=Cheeger inequality=
When the graph ''G'' is ''d''-regular, there is a relationship between ''h''(''G'') and the spectral gap ''d'' − λ<sub>2</sub> of ''G''. An inequality due to Dodziuk<ref>J.Dodziuk, Difference Equations, Isoperimetric inequality and Transience of Certain Random Walks, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 284 (1984), no. 2, 787-794.</ref> and independently Noga Alon|Alon and Vitali Milman|MilmanSfn|Alon|Spencer|2011 states that<ref>Theorem 2.4 in harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006</ref>

: <math>\tfrac{1}{2}(d - \lambda_2) \le h(G) \le \sqrt{2d(d - \lambda_2)}.</math>

This inequality is closely related to the Cheeger bound for Markov chains and can be seen as a discrete version of Cheeger constant#Cheeger.27s inequality|Cheeger's inequality in Riemannian geometry.

 Hoffman-Delsarte inequality 
There is an eigenvalue bound for Independent set (graph theory)|independent sets in regular graphs, originally due to Alan J. Hoffman and Philippe Delsarte.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cgodsil/pdfs/ekrs-clg.pdf|title=Erdős-Ko-Rado Theorems|last=Godsil|first=Chris|date=May 2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=</ref>

Suppose that <math>G</math> is a <math>k</math>-regular graph on <math>n</math> vertices with least eigenvalue <math>\lambda_{\mathrm{min</math>. Then:<math display="block">\alpha(G) \leq \frac{n}{1 - \frac{k}{\lambda_{\mathrm{min</math>where <math>\alpha(G)</math> denotes its independence number.

This bound has been applied to establish e.g. algebraic proofs of the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem and its analogue for intersecting families of subspaces over finite fields.<ref>Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935456305|title=Erdős-Ko-Rado theorems : algebraic approaches|last=1949-|first=Godsil, C.

Historical outline
Spectral graph theory emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. Besides graph theory|graph theoretic research on the relationship between structural and spectral properties of graphs, another major source was research in quantum chemistry, but the connections between these two lines of work were not discovered until much later.<ref name= cvet2>''Eigenspaces of Graphs'', by Dragoš Cvetković, Peter Rowlinson, Slobodan Simić (1997) isbn|0-521-57352-1</ref> The 1980 monograph ''Spectra of Graphs''<ref>Dragoš M. Cvetković, Michael Doob, Horst Sachs, ''Spectra of Graphs'' (1980)</ref> by Cvetković, Doob, and Sachs summarised nearly all research to date in the area. In 1988 it was updated by the survey ''Recent Results in the Theory of Graph Spectra''.<ref>cite book|first1=Dragoš M.|last1=Cvetković |first2=Michael |last2=Doob |first3=Ivan |last3=Gutman |first4=A. |last4=Torgasev |title=Recent Results in the Theory of Graph Spectra |series=Annals of Discrete mathematics |number=36 |year=1988 |isbn=0-444-70361-6 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/01675060/36</ref> The 3rd edition of ''Spectra of Graphs'' (1995) contains a summary of the further recent contributions to the subject.<ref name= cvet2/> Discrete geometric analysis created and developed by Toshikazu Sunada in the 2000s deals with spectral graph theory in terms of discrete Laplacians associated with weighted graphs,<ref>citation | last = Sunada | first = Toshikazu | journal = Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics | pages = 51–86 | title =  Discrete geometric analysis | volume = 77 | year = 2008.</ref> and finds application in various fields, including Spectral shape analysis|shape analysis.
