Graph operations produce new Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs from initial ones. They may be separated into the following major categories.  

Unary operations
Unary operations create a new graph from one initial one.

=Elementary operations=
Elementary operations or editing operations create a new graph from one initial one by a simple local change, such as addition or deletion of a vertex or of an edge, merging and splitting of vertices, edge contraction, etc.
The graph edit distance between a pair of graphs is the minimum number of elementary operations required to transform one graph into the other.

=Advanced operations=
Advanced operations create a new graph from one initial one by a complex changes, such as:
* transpose graph;
* complement graph;
* line graph;
* graph minor;
* graph rewriting;
* power of graph;
* dual graph;
* medial graph;
* quotient graph;
* Y-Δ transform;
* Mycielskian.

Binary operations
Binary operations create a new graph from two initial ones nobreak|1=''G''<sub>1</sub> = (''V''<sub>1</sub>, ''E''<sub>1</sub>) and nobreak|1=''G''<sub>2</sub> = (''V''<sub>2</sub>, ''E''<sub>2</sub>), such as:
* graph union: nobreak|1=''G''<sub>1</sub> ∪ ''G''<sub>2</sub>.  There are two definitions.  In the most common one, the disjoint union of graphs, the union is assumed to be disjoint.  Less commonly (though more consistent with the general definition of union (set theory)|union in mathematics) the union of two graphs is defined as the graph nobreak|(''V''<sub>1</sub> ∪ ''V''<sub>2</sub>, ''E''<sub>1</sub> ∪ ''E''<sub>2</sub>).

* graph intersection: nobreak|1=''G''<sub>1</sub> ∩ ''G''<sub>2</sub> = (''V''<sub>1</sub> ∩ ''V''<sub>2</sub>, ''E''<sub>1</sub> ∩ ''E''<sub>2</sub>);<ref name=bondy_murty>cite book
