A figure of speech or rhetorical figure<ref>cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWBgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA113 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508135920/https://books.google.com/books?id=YWBgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA113 |archivedate=2016-05-08 |df= </ref> is figurative language in the form of a single word or phrase. It can be a special repetition, arrangement or omission of words with literal meaning, or a phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words.dubious|date=July 2016 Figures of speech often provide emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use, as figures of speech can introduce an ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretation.dubious|date=July 2016

 Four rhetorical operations 
Main|Rhetorical operations

Classical rhetoricians classified figures of speech into rhetorical operations|four categories or ''quadripartita ratio'':<ref name="Jansen">Jansen, Jeroen (2008) ''[http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio Imitatio] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714140654/http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio |date=2015-07-14 '' ISBN|978-90-8704-027-7 [http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html Summary] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205211147/http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html |date=2008-12-05  translated to English by Kristine Steenbergh. Quote from the summary: <blockquote>Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils’ own writing.</blockquote></ref>

* addition (''adiectio''), also called repetition/expansion/superabundance
* omission (''detractio''), also called subtraction/abridgement/lack
* transposition (''transmutatio''), also called transferring
* permutation (''immutatio''), also called switching/interchange/substitution/transmutation

These categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'', of unknown authorship, where they are called πλεονασμός (pleonasmos - addition), ἔνδεια (endeia - omission), μετάθεσις (metathesios - transposition) and ἐναλλαγή (enallage - permutation).<ref>Book V, 21.29, pp.303–5</ref> Quintillian then mentioned them in ''Institutio Oratoria''.<ref>Institutio Oratoria, Vol. I, Book I, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/1B*.html Chapter 5], paragraphs 6 and 38–41. And also in Book VI [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/6C*.html Chapter 3]</ref> Philo of Alexandria also listed them as addition (πρόσθεσις - prosthesis), subtraction (ἀφαίρεσις - afairesis), transposition (μετάθεσις - metathesis), and transmutation (ἀλλοίωσις - alloiosis).<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4B*.html Rhetorica ad Herennium]</ref>

 Examples 
Figures of speech come in many varieties. The aim is to use the language inventively to accentuate the effect of what is being said. A few examples follow:

* "Around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran" is an example of alliteration, where the consonant ''r'' is used repeatedly.
:Whereas, "Sister Suzy sewing socks for soldiers" is a particular form of alliteration called sibilance, because it repeats the letter ''s''.
:Both are commonly used in poetry.
* "She would run up the stairs and then a new set of curtains" is a variety of zeugma called a syllepsis. ''Run up'' refers to ascending and also to manufacturing. The effect is enhanced by the momentary suggestion, through a pun, that she might be climbing up the curtains. The ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis or omission of the second use of the verb makes the reader think harder about what is being said.
* "Painful pride" is an oxymoron where two contradictory ideas are placed in the same sentence.
*"An Einstein" is an example of synecdoche, as it uses a particular name to represent a class of people: geniuses.
* "I had butterflies in my stomach" is a metaphor, referring to a nervous feeling as if there were flying insects in one's stomach.
:To say "it was like having some butterflies in my stomach" would be a simile, because it uses the word ''like'' which is missing in the metaphor.
:To say "It was like having a butterfly farm in my stomach", "It felt like a butterfly farm in my stomach", or "I was so nervous that I had a butterfly farm in my stomach" could be a hyperbole, because it is exaggerated.
*"That filthy place was really dirty" is an example of Tautology (grammar)|tautology, as there are the two words ('filthy' and 'dirty') having almost the same meaning and are repeated so as to make the text more emphatic.

Scholars of classical Western rhetoric have divided figures of speech into two main categories: schemes and tropes. ''Scheme (linguistics)|Schemes'' (from the Greek lang|grc-Latn|schēma, 'form or shape') are figures of speech that change the ordinary or expected pattern of words. For example, the phrase, "John, my best friend" uses the scheme known as apposition. ''Trope (linguistics)|Tropes'' (from Greek lang|grc-Latn|trepein, 'to turn') change the general meaning of words. An example of a trope is irony, which is the use of words to convey the opposite of their usual meaning ("For Brutus is an honorable man; / So are they all, all honorable men").

During the Renaissance, scholars meticulously enumerated and classified figures of speech. Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham, for example, in his ''The Garden of Eloquence'' (1577), enumerated 184 different figures of speech. Professor Robert DiYanni, in his book "Literature – Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay"<ref>Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, ISBN|0-07-557112-9, pp.451</ref> wrote: "Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different ''figures of speech'', expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense."

For simplicity, this article divides the figures between schemes and tropes, but does not further sub-classify them (e.g., "Figures of Disorder"). Within each category, words are listed alphabetically. Most entries link to a page that provides greater detail and relevant examples, but a short definition is placed here for convenience. Some of those listed may be considered rhetorical devices, which are similar in many ways.
