Far more work has gone into reconstructing PIE than any other proto-language, and it is by far the best understood of all proto-languages of its age. The vast majority of linguistic work during the 19th century was devoted to the reconstruction of PIE or its daughter proto-languages (such as Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-Iranian), and most of the modern techniques of linguistic reconstruction (such as the comparative method) were developed as a result. These methods supply all current knowledge concerning PIE since there is no written record of the language.

PIE is estimated to have been spoken as a single language from 4500&nbsp;BC to 2500&nbsp;BC<ref>Cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/exclusives/articles/1302-proto-indo-european-schleichers-fable |title=Telling Tales in Proto-Indo-European |work=Archaeology |last=Powell |first=Eric A. |access-date=2017-07-30 </ref> during the Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, though estimates vary by more than a thousand years. According to the prevailing Kurgan hypothesis, the proto-Indo-European homeland|original homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have been in the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Eastern Europe. The linguistic reconstruction of PIE has also provided insight into the proto-Indo-European culture|culture and proto-Indo-European religion|religion of its speakers.<ref name=":0">Cite book |title=Indo-European language and culture: an introduction |last=Fortson |first=Benjamin W. |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=1405103159 |location=Malden, Mass |page=16 |oclc=54529041 |ref=harv </ref>

As Proto-Indo-Europeans became isolated from each other through the Indo-European migrations, the Proto-Indo-European language became spoken by the various groups in regional dialects which then underwent the Indo-European sound laws divergence, and along with shifts in morphology, these dialects slowly but eventually transformed into the known ancient Indo-European languages. From there, further linguistic divergence led to the evolution of their current descendants, the modern Indo-European languages. Today, the descendant languages, or daughter languages, of PIE with the most native speakers are Spanish language|Spanish, English language|English, Portuguese language|Portuguese, Hindustani language|Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu),  Bengali language|Bengali, Russian language|Russian, Punjabi language|Punjabi, German language|German, Persian language|Persian, French language|French, Italian language|Italian and Marathi language|Marathi. Hundreds of other living descendants of PIE range from languages as diverse as Albanian language|Albanian (lang|sq|gjuha shqipe), Kurdish languages|Kurdish (lang|ku-Arab|کوردی), Nepali language|Nepali (lang|ne|खस भाषा), Tsakonian language|Tsakonian (lang|tsd|τσακώνικα), Ukrainian language|Ukrainian (lang|uk|українська мова), and Welsh language|Welsh (lang|cy|Cymraeg).

PIE had an elaborate system of morphology (linguistics)|morphology that included inflection|inflectional suffixes (analogous to English ''life, lives, life's, lives'&zwj;'')<!-- ZWJ because ' includes a 0.1em space before the apostrophe --> as well as indo-European ablaut|ablaut (vowel alterations, for example, as preserved in English ''sing, sang, sung'') and proto-Indo-European accent|accent. PIE proto-Indo-European nominals|nominals and proto-Indo-European pronouns|pronouns had a complex system of declension, and Proto-Indo-European verbs|verbs similarly had a complex system of Grammatical conjugation|conjugation. The PIE proto-Indo-European phonology|phonology, proto-Indo-European particles|particles, proto-Indo-European numerals|numerals, and indo-European copula|copula are also well-reconstructed.

An asterisk is used to mark reconstructed words, such as *''PIE|wódr̥'' 'water', *''PIE|ḱwṓ'' 'dog' (English ''hound''), or *''PIE|tréyes'' 'three (masculine)'.

Development of the hypothesis
No direct evidence of PIE remains – scholars have reconstructed PIE from its present-day descendants using the Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/linguistics/The-comparative-method#toc35116|title=Linguistics – The comparative method ! science|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Encyclopedia Brittanica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 July 2016</ref>

The comparative method follows the Neogrammarian rule: the Indo-European sound laws apply without exception. The method compares languages and uses the sound laws to find a common ancestor. For example, compare the pairs of words in Italian and English: ''piede'' and ''foot'', ''padre'' and ''father'', ''pesce'' and ''fish''. Since there is a consistent correspondence of the initial consonants that emerges far too frequently to be coincidental, one can assume that these languages stem from a common parent language|parent-language.<ref name="comp-ling">cite web|title= Comparative linguistics|url= https://www.britannica.com/science/comparative-linguistics|website= Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate= 27 August 2016</ref>

By the early 1900s Indo-Europeanists had developed well-defined descriptions of PIE which scholars still accept today. Later, the discovery of the Anatolian languages|Anatolian and Tocharian languages added to the corpus of descendant languages. A new principle won wide acceptance in the laryngeal theory, which explained irregularities in the linguistic reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European phonology as the effects of hypothetical sounds which had disappeared from all documented languages, but which were later observed in excavated cuneiform tablets in Anatolian.

Julius Pokorny's ''Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'' ("Indo-European Etymological Dictionary", 1959) gave a detailed, though conservative, overview of the lexical knowledge then accumulated. Jerzy Kuryłowicz|Kuryłowicz's 1956 ''Apophonie'' gave a better understanding of Indo-European ablaut. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became robust enough to establish its relationship to PIE.

Historical and geographical setting
Multiple hypotheses have been suggested about when, where, and by whom PIE was spoken. The Kurgan hypothesis, first put forward by Marija Gimbutas, is the most popular of these.<ref name="anth-ringe">cite journal|last2=Ringe|first2=Done|date=2015|title=The Indo-European Homeland from Linguistic and Archaeological Perspectives|journal=Annual Review of Linguistics|volume=1|pages=199–219|last1=Anthony|first1=David W.|doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-124812</ref><ref>cite book|title=In Search of the Indo-Europeans|date=1991|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0500276167|page=185|last1=Mallory|first1=J.

According to the theory, PIE became widespread because its speakers, the Kurgans, were able to migrate into a vast area of Europe and Asia, thanks to technologies such as the domestication of the horse, herding, and the use of wheeled vehicles.<ref name ="Science" />

The people of these cultures were Eurasian nomads|nomadic pastoralists, who, according to the model, by the early 3rd millennium BC had expanded throughout the Pontic–Caspian steppe and into Eastern Europe.<ref>Cite journal|last=Gimbutas|first=Marija|year=1985|title=Primary and Secondary Homeland of the Indo-Europeans: comments on Gamkrelidze-Ivanov articles|url=|journal=Journal of Indo-European Studies|volume=13|issue=1–2|pages=185–202</ref>

Common subgroups of Indo-European languages which are proposed include Italo-Celtic, Graeco-Aryan, Graeco-Armenian, Graeco-Phrygian, Daco-Thracian, and Thraco-Illyrian.

=Marginally attested languages=
The Lusitanian language is a marginally attested language found in the area of modern Portugal.

The Paleo-Balkan languages, which occur in or near the Balkan peninsula, do not appear to be members of any of the subfamilies of PIE but are so poorly attested that proper classification of them is not possible. Albanian and Greek are the only surviving Indo-European languages in the group.

Phonology
Main article|Proto-Indo-European phonology

Proto-Indo-European phonology has been reconstructed in some detail. Notable features of the most widely accepted (but not uncontroversial) reconstruction include:
*three series of stop consonants reconstructed as voiceless consonant|voiceless, voiced consonant|voiced, and breathy voiced;
*sonorant consonants that could be used syllabic consonant|syllabically; 
*three so-called laryngeal theory|laryngeal consonants, whose exact pronunciation is not well-established but which are believed to have existed in part based on their visible effects on adjacent sounds; 
*the fricative /s/; and 
*a five-vowel system of which /e/ and /o/ were the most frequently occurring vowels.

The Proto-Indo-European accent is reconstructed today as having had variable lexical stress, which could appear on any syllable and whose position often varied among different members of a paradigm (e.g. between singular and plural of a verbal paradigm). Stressed syllables received a higher pitch; therefore it is often said that PIE had Pitch-accent language|pitch accent. The location of the stress is associated with ablaut variations, especially between normal-grade vowels (/e/ and /o/) and zero-grade (i.e. lack of a vowel), but not entirely predictable from it.

The accent is best preserved in Vedic Sanskrit and (in the case of nouns) Ancient Greek, and indirectly attested in a number of phenomena in other IE languages. To account for mismatches between the accent of Vedic Sanskrit and Ancient Greek, as well as a few other phenomena, a few historical linguists prefer to reconstruct PIE as a Tone (linguistics)|tone language where each morpheme had an inherent tone; the sequence of tones in a word then evolved, according to that hypothesis, into the placement of lexical stress in different ways in different IE branches.Citation needed|date=January 2017

Morphology
=Root=
Proto-Indo-European roots were affix-lacking morphemes which carried the core Lexical (semiotics)|lexical meaning of a word and were used to derive related words (e.g., "-''friend''-" in the English words "''befriend''", "''friends''", and "''friend''" by itself). Proto-Indo-European was a fusional language, in which inflectional morphemes signalled the grammatical relationships between words. This dependence on inflectional morphemes means that roots in PIE, unlike those found in English, were rarely found by themselves. A root plus a suffix formed a word stem, and a word stem plus a desinence (usually an ending) formed a word.sfnp|Fortson|2004|p=16

=Ablaut=
Many morphemes in Proto-Indo-European had short ''e'' as their inherent vowel; the Indo-European ablaut is the change of this short ''e'' to short ''o'', long ''e'' (ē), long ''o'' (''ō''), or no vowel. This variation in vowels occurred both within inflectional morphology (e.g., different grammatical forms of a noun or verb may have different vowels) and derivational morphology (e.g., a verb and an associated abstract verbal noun may have different vowels).sfnp|Fortson|2004|pp=73–74

Categories that PIE distinguished through ablaut were often also identifiable by contrasting endings, but the loss of these endings in some later Indo-European languages has led them to use ablaut alone to identify grammatical categories, as in the Modern English words ''sing'', ''sang'', ''sung''.

=Noun=
Proto-Indo-European nominals|Proto-Indo-European nouns are declined for eight or nine cases:sfnp|Fortson|2004|p=102
*Nominative case|nominative: marks the Subject (grammar)|subject of a verb, such as ''They'' in ''They ate''. Words that follow a linking verb and rename the subject of that verb also use the nominative case. Thus, both ''They'' and ''linguists'' are in the nominative case in ''They are linguists''. The nominative is the dictionary form of the noun.
*Accusative case|accusative: used for the direct object of a transitive verb.
*genitive case|genitive: marks a noun as modifying another noun.
*Dative case|dative:  used to indicate the indirect object of a transitive verb, such as ''Jacob'' in ''Maria gave Jacob a drink''.
*Instrumental case|instrumental: marks the ''instrument'' or means by, or with which, the subject achieves or accomplishes an action. It may be either a physical object or an abstract concept.
*ablative case|ablative: used to express motion away from something.
*locative case|locative: corresponds vaguely to the English prepositions ''in'', ''on'', ''at'', and ''by''.
*Vocative case|vocative: used for a word that identifies an addressee. A vocative expression is one of direct address where the identity of the party spoken to is set forth expressly within a sentence. For example, in the sentence, "I don't know, John", ''John'' is a vocative expression that indicates the party being addressed.
*allative case|allative: used as a type of locative case that expresses movement towards something. Only the Anatolian languages maintain this case, and it may not have existed in Proto-Indo-European at all.sfnp|Fortson|2004|pp=102, 105
There were three grammatical genders:
* masculine
* feminine
* neuter

=Pronoun=
Proto-Indo-European pronouns are difficult to reconstruct, owing to their variety in later languages.  PIE had personal pronouns in the first and second grammatical person, but not the third person, where demonstrative pronouns were used instead. The personal pronouns had their own unique forms and endings, and some had Suppletion|two distinct stems; this is most obvious in the first person singular where the two stems are still preserved in English ''I'' and ''me''. There were also two varieties for the accusative, genitive and dative cases, a stressed and an enclitic form.<ref name="beekes">cite book|last1=Beekes|first1=Robert|last2=Gabriner|first2=Paul|title=Comparative Indo-European linguistics: an introduction|date=1995|publisher=J.

=Verb=<!-- This section is linked from Vedic Sanskrit grammar -->
Proto-Indo-European verbs, like the nouns, exhibited a system of ablaut. The most basic categorization for the Indo-European verb was grammatical aspect. Verbs were classed as:
*stative verb|stative: verbs that depict a state of being
*imperfective aspect|imperfective: verbs depicting ongoing, habitual or repeated action
*perfective aspect|perfective: verbs depicting a completed action or actions viewed as an entire process.
Verbs have at least four grammatical moods:
*indicative mood|indicative: indicates that something is a statement of fact; in other words, to express what the speaker considers to be a known state of affairs, as in declarative sentences.
*imperative mood|imperative: forms commands or requests, including the giving of prohibition or permission, or any other kind of advice or exhortation.
*subjunctive mood|subjunctive: used to express various states of unreality such as wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, obligation, or action that has not yet occurred
*optative mood|optative: indicates a wish or hope. It is similar to the cohortative mood and is closely related to the subjunctive mood.
Verbs had two grammatical voices:
* active voice|active: used in a clause whose subject expresses the main verb's Agent (grammar)|agent.
*mediopassive voice|mediopassive: for the middle voice and the passive voice.
Verbs had three grammatical persons: (first, second and third)

Verbs had three grammatical numbers:
*singular
*dual grammatical number|dual: referring to precisely two of the entities (objects or persons) identified by the noun or pronoun.
*plural: a number other than singular or dual.
Verbs were also marked by a highly developed system of participles, one for each combination of tense and voice, and an assorted array of verbal nouns and adjectival formations.

The following table shows a possible reconstruction of the PIE verb endings from Sihler, which largely represents the current consensus among Indo-Europeanists.

Rather than specifically 100, PIE|''*ḱm̥tóm'' may originally have meant "a large number".<ref>Citation|last=Lehmann|first=Winfried P|title=Theoretical Bases of Indo-European Linguistics|year=1993|postscript=|pages=252–55|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-08201-3</ref>

=Particle=
Proto-Indo-European particles could be used both as adverbs and Preposition and postposition|postpositions, like PIE|''*upo'' "under, below". The postpositions became prepositions in most daughter languages. Other reconstructible particles include Affirmative and negative|negators (PIE|''*ne, *mē''), Conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions (PIE|''*kʷe'' "and", PIE|''*wē'' "or" and others) and an interjection (PIE|''*wai!'', an expression of woe or agony).

Syntax
The syntax of the older Indo-European languages has been studied in earnest since at least the late nineteenth century, by such scholars as Hermann Hirt and Berthold Delbrück. In the second half of the twentieth century, interest in the topic increased and led to reconstructions of Proto-Indo-European syntax.<ref>cite encyclopedia |title=Preface |encyclopedia=Proto-Indo-European Syntax and its Development |editor1-first=Leonid |editor1-last=Kulikov |editor2-first=Nikolaos |editor2-last=Lavidas |publisher=John Benjamins |year=2015</ref>

Since all the early attested IE languages were inflectional, PIE is thought to have relied primarily on morphological markers, rather than word order, to signal syntax|syntactic relationships within sentences.r|eiec Still, a default (Markedness|unmarked) word order is thought to have existed in PIE. This was reconstructed by Jacob Wackernagel as being subject–verb–object (SVO), based on evidence in Vedic Sanskrit, and the SVO hypothesis still has some adherents, but as of|2015|lc=y the "broad consensus" among PIE scholars is that PIE would have been a subject–object–verb (SOV) language.<ref>cite encyclopedia |title=Proto-Indo-European verb-finality: Reconstruction, typology, validation |first=Hans Henrich |last=Hock |authorlink=Hans Henrich Hock |encyclopedia=Proto-Indo-European Syntax and its Development |editor1-first=Leonid |editor1-last=Kulikov |editor2-first=Nikolaos |editor2-last=Lavidas |publisher=John Benjamins |year=2015</ref>

The SOV default word order with other orders used to express emphasis (e.g., verb–subject–object to emphasise the verb) is attested in Old Indic, Old Iranian, Old Latin and Hittite language|Hittite, while traces of it can be found in the enclitic personal pronouns of the Tocharian languages.<ref name="eiec">Cite encyclopedia |editor-first1=J.

 In popular culture 
The Ridley Scott film ''Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus'' features an android named "David" (played by Michael Fassbender) who learns Proto-Indo-European to communicate with the "Engineer", an extraterrestrial whose race may have created humans. David practices PIE by reciting Schleicher's fable<ref>Cite web |last=Roush |first=George |date=20 June 2012 |title='Prometheus' Secret Revealed: What Did David Say to the Engineer |url=http://screencrush.com/prometheus/ |publisher=Screen Crush |access-date=29 July 2017</ref> and goes on to attempt communication with the Engineer through PIE. Linguist Dr Anil Biltoo created the film's reconstructed dialogue and had an onscreen role teaching David Schleicher's fable.<ref>Cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Lucy |date=14 October 2012 |title=Designing Prometheus |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/15/designing-prometheus |publisher=IGN |access-date=29 July 2017</ref>
