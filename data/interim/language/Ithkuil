Ithkuil is an experimental language|experimental constructed language created by John Quijada,<ref name="foer-2012">Joshua Foer, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer "John Quijada and Ithkuil, the Language He Invented"], ''The New Yorker'', December 24, 2012.</ref> designed to express deeper levels of human cognition briefly yet overtly and clearly, particularly with regard to human categorization. Presented as a cross between an a priori (languages)|a priori philosophical language|philosophical and a logical language|logical language striving to minimize the ambiguities and semantic vagueness found in natural human languages,<ref name="intro">[http://www.ithkuil.net/00_intro.html ''A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language''– Introduction]</ref> Ithkuil is notable for its grammatical complexity and extensive phoneme inventory, the latter being simplified in the final version of the language. The name "Ithkuil" is an anglicized form of ''Îţkûil'', which in the original form roughly means "hypothetical representation of a language".<ref name="intro" /> Quijada states he did not create Ithkuil to be international auxiliary language|auxiliary or used in everyday conversations, but rather to serve as a language for more elaborate and profound fields where more insightful thoughts are expected, such as philosophy, arts, science and politics.<ref name="faqs">[http://ithkuil.net/faqs.html Ithkuil FAQs]</ref>

The many examples from the original grammar book<ref name="intro"/> show that a message, like a meaningful phrase or a sentence, can usually be expressed in Ithkuil with fewer sounds, or lexically distinct speech-elements, than in natural human languages. For example, the two-word Ithkuil sentence "''Tram-mļöi  hhâsmařpţuktôx''" can be translated into English as "On the contrary, I think it may turn out that this rugged mountain range trails off at some point".<ref name="intro"/> Quijada deems his creation too complex and strictly regular a language to have developed naturally, but nonetheless a language suited to human conversation. No person, including Quijada himself, is known to be able to speak Ithkuil fluently.

Three versions of the language have been publicized: the initial version in 2004, a simplified version called Ilaksh in 2007, and the version in 2011, with additional updates on the morphophonology and lexicon. As of 2019, a new (yet to be named) language is being developed by Quijada based on Ithkuil.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.ithkuil.net/morpho-phonology_version_0_6.pdf|title=TENTATIVE MORPHO-PHONOLOGICAL DESIGN FOR A NEW LANGUAGE BASED ON ITHKUIL|last=Quijada|first=John|date=January 19, 2019|website=http://www.ithkuil.net|archive-url=|archive-date=January 19, 2019|dead-url=http://www.ithkuil.net/morpho-phonology_version_0_6.pdf|access-date=February 2, 2019</ref>

Because Ithkuil is designed for users to be precise in their speech, it is quite difficult to express humorous concepts in Ithkuil.<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/a-l|title=Ça üšlá|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US</ref>

= Ilaksh (2007) =
The initial publication of Ithkuil in 2004 had an extensive phonology of 65 consonants and 17 vowels. Since the mention of Ithkuil in the Russian magazine ''Computerra'',<ref name="kozl" /> several speakers of Russian contacted Quijada and expressed enthusiasm to learn Ithkuil for its application to psychonetics, with several complaining about its difficulty in pronunciation. Quijada remade Ithkuil's morphophonology with 30 consonants and 10 vowels (and the addition of Tone (linguistics)|tones) and published the revision on 10 June 2007 as Ilaksh.<ref name="intro" /> The language featured other amendments to grammar, including some additional Levels and a change of Cases. It was redesigned to be easier to speak and included an additional writing system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605210044/http://ithkuil.net/ilaksh/images/script_diagram.gif Ilaksh script diagram (indicates what the various parts of an Ilaksh logogram indicate) (no longer available on site, link shows archive.org's cache)]</ref><ref>[http://ithkuil.net/11_script.htm#Sec11o6 Ilaksh formal / ornamental script example, an updated version of the older script diagram]</ref><ref>Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522161309/http://www.ithkuil.net:80/ilaksh/Chapter_11.htm|title=A Grammar of the Ithkuil Language - Chapter 11: The Script|date=2009-05-22|access-date=2018-08-10</ref> The initial sequential "informal" system suitable for handwriting or compact typesetting, and a "formal" logographic system with artistic possibilities resembling Maya scripts.

In the "informal" writing system, several parallel sets of lines are shaped to correspond sequentially to the different parallel sets of lexemes and inflections. It is directly pronounceable. The author designed it with reserve for convenient handwriting. The overall design would permit compact, clear, black-and-white rendering.

In the colorful "formal" script, a single complex glyph represented an entire sentence. Diversely shaped, shaded and superimposed cartouches represent the syntax|syntactic relations of the verb and noun phrases of a sentence. The edges of the cartouches had particular shapes that indicate one set of inflections, the colors indicate another set of inflections, and the textures yet another one. On the cartouches, letters of hexagonal outline would spell out the forms of particular lexemes. The cartouches formed phrases, with primary phrases overlapping subordinate phrases. The coloring system utilized different color densities and texturing for different colors in order to be usable by colorblind people. These density conventions also allowed the formal system to be inexpensively printed in black-and-white, or inscribed or imprinted on stone or other materials.<ref name="script">[http://www.ithkuil.net/11_script.htm Ilaksh Chapter 11: The Writing System]</ref>

= Ithkuil (2011) =
Ilaksh was superseded by a newer language, also termed Ithkuil because of its ties to the initial publication. Its script uses a unique morpho-phonemic principle that allows sentences representing grammatical categories to be pronounced in multiple ways as the speaker sees fit. As of July 2011, Quijada planned to adopt the cartouche script "for use as an alternative, 'ornamental' writing system for artistic purposes" to the newest revision of Ithkuil, which was made to be morphologically similar to Ilaksh.

Owing to complaints about the difficult patterns in the language morphology from the community Reddit forum, on 30 October 2017, Quijada published a tentative [http://www.ithkuil.net/Morpho-Phonology_Redesign_01.pdf outline] for a new version of the language, which has yet to be named, addressing learners' desires for a more Agglutination|agglutinative morphophonology, including a restructured Formative outline, and extended use of Adjuncts for flexible expression of the grammar to further create phonaesthetics.

= Morphophonology =
Ithkuil words can be divided into just two Part of speech|parts of speech, ''formatives'' and ''adjuncts''. Formatives can function both as nouns and as verbs, derived from the root and depending on the morpho-semantic context.<ref name="morphophonology">[http://ithkuil.net/02_morpho-phonology.html A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Chapter 2: Morpho-phonology]</ref>

Formatives
Roots are Ithkuil's most basic semantic units. All Ithkuil formatives are derived from a limited number of roots. Each root consists of a cluster of 1–4 consonants (five-consonant clusters are also available, but remain without an assigned meaning).<ref name="morphophonology"/> The current lexicon of Ithkuil can potentially consist of approximately 3,600 Root (linguistics)|word roots.<ref name="morphophonology" /> So far, just over 1000 have been assigned translations.<ref name="lexicon">[http://www.ithkuil.net/lexicon.htm The Lexicon]</ref> From the root, word stems are formed by affixing the vocalic affix that indicates pattern, stem type, and function, and by stressing a particular syllable to indicate informal or formal designation.<ref name="morphophonology" /><ref name="morphology">[http://www.ithkuil.net//03_morphology.html A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Chapter 3: Basic Morphology]</ref>

There are three stems associated with each root. Each stem comes in three patterns, one holistic and two complementary ones. Holistic stem 1 typically refers to the most general manifestation of a root, whereas holistic stems 2 and 3 typically refer to more specific manifestations associated with the root. Each holistic stem has two complementary stems associated with it, which refer to the complementary concepts related to the holistic stem.<ref name="morphophonology"/> The specific meaning of complementary stems depends somewhat on the root. These are derived from the word roots by prefixing a vowel or diphthong that also indicates the grammatical category ''function''.<ref name="morphophonology"/> Two examples are given in the tables below:

=Basic morphology=
All Ithkuil formatives, whether functioning as nouns or verbs, inflect for various grammatical categories that are quite dissimilar from any of those in natural languages.<ref name="morphology"/> Quantization is more or less covered by the grammatical categories of ''Configuration'', ''Affiliation'', and ''Perspective'', even though these do not technically refer to number per se.<ref name="morphology"/>

=Cases=
There are 96 grammatical cases in Ithkuil, one special case being the Vocative, used for direct address. Verbal formatives inflect for case under Frame constructions (i.e., dependent clauses). The grammatical cases of Ithkuil can be divided into several distinct groups:<ref name="case">[http://www.ithkuil.net/04_case.html A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Chapter 4: Case morphology]</ref>

Ithkuil nominal formatives also carry a ''function'', but cannot be inflected for them, always remaining in the "stative".<ref name="verbs1"/>

Suffixes

Ithkuil uses a variety of affixes, termed suffixes, to further delineate what is described by the formative.

Adjuncts
There are two types of adjuncts in Ithkuil: personal-reference adjuncts and verbal adjuncts.<ref name="morphophonology"/> All adjuncts are highly synthetic language|synthetic.

Personal-reference adjuncts are akin to pronouns in English. There are two types of personal-reference adjuncts in Ithkuil: Single-referent and dual-referent.<ref name="adjuncts">[http://www.ithkuil.net/08_adjuncts.html A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Chapter 8: Adjuncts]</ref>

Verbal adjuncts are adjuncts that work in conjunction with verbal formatives to provide information about the latter's ''Valence'', ''Level'', ''Phase'', ''Sanction'', ''Illocution'', ''Modality'', ''Aspect'', and ''Bias''.<ref name="morphophonology"/> Of these, ''Modality'' and ''Level'' can only be indicated using verbal adjuncts, whereas the others can also be expressed on the verbal formative.<ref name="verbs2">[http://www.ithkuil.net/06_verbs_2.html A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Chapter 6 – More verb morphology]</ref>

 Numerical system 
Ithkuil uses a Radix|base 100 numeral system with roots for the numbers 1 to 10, and a stem-specific derivative suffix used with a number root to add a multiple of 10, providing the numerals up to 99. Ithkuil did not originally use the concept of zero. Numbers greater than 100 are expressed periphrastically in speech, whereas a special numerical script had logograms for the numbers 1 to 100 and exponential powers of 100.

On 27 March 2015 Quijada released a [http://www.ithkuil.net/ithkuil_math_and_measurement.pdf mathematical sublanguage] using a dozenal number system.

=Orthography=

File:Ithkuil-ex001.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ithkuil-ex001.jpg|thumb|"Tram-mļöi hhâsmařpţuktôx" written in the Ithkuil script. English translation: "On the contrary, I think it may turn out that this rugged mountain range trails off at some point"

Ithkuil uses a morphophonemic script because characters convey both phonetic and morphological information. Its use is closely tied to Ithkuil's grammatical system, which allows much of the phonological aspect of words to be morpho-syntactically inferred. Those parts of an Ithkuil word whose pronunciation is predictable are not written, whereas the characters used to indicate the pronunciation of the unpredictable parts of a word also convey the grammatical information necessary to reconstruct the implicit phonetics. Words are thus written in a highly abbreviated manner, particularly useful for the highly inflected, occasionally elongated words of the Ithkuil language. The script is also used alphabetically for transliterating foreign words and mathematical expressions.

 Past versions 

=Original Ithkuil=
The 2004 version of Ithkuil had a significantly more complicated morphophonology.

 Phonology 
The phonology|phonological system of the original Ithkuil consisted of 65 consonants, including the palatal plosives /ɟ/, /c/, /cʰ/, /cʼ/; uvular plosive /ɢ/; retroflex affricates /ɖ͡ʐ/, /ʈ͡ʂ/, /ʈ͡ʂʰ/, /ʈ͡ʂʼ/; lateral Aspirated consonant|aspirated and central Ejective consonant|ejective Palatal consonant|palatal affricates /cʎ̥˔ʰ/, /c͡çʼ/; Velar consonant|velar affricates /k͡xʼ/, /q͡χʼ/; retroflex fricatives /ʐ/, /ʂ/; Voiced palatal fricative|palatal fricative /ʝ/; Voiced velar fricative|velar fricative /ɣ/; voiceless pharyngeal fricative /ħ/; two Dental, alveolar and postalveolar lateral approximants|dental approximants /l̪/ /ɫ̪/ (substituted for the alveolar approximant /l/); and the retroflex approximant /ɻ/.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.ithkuil.net:80/ithkuil-ch1-phonology.htm|title=Ithkuil Phonology|last=|first=|date=2009-06-08|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608003709/http://www.ithkuil.net:80/ithkuil-ch1-phonology.htm|archive-date=2009-06-08|dead-url=yes</ref> /m n̪ ŋ l ɫ ɻ/ could be syllabic. /h/ was [ɸ] when preceded by a vowel and followed by another consonant. [cʎ̥˔ʰ] was in free variation with [cʎ̥˔ʼ], the latter being more common at the beginning of a word. All consonants except /j w/ could be geminated; when geminated, /h/ was a Voiceless bidental fricative|bidental fricative and /ɽ/ an Alveolar Trill|aveolar trill.

The diphthongs were IPA|/ai̯/, IPA|/æi̯/, IPA|/ei̯/, IPA|/ɤi̯/, IPA|/øi̯/, IPA|/oi̯/, IPA|/ʊi̯/, IPA|/au̯/, IPA|/æu̯/, IPA|/eu̯/, IPA|/ɤu̯/, IPA|/ɪu̯/, IPA|/ou̯/, IPA|/øu̯/, IPA|/aɯ̯/, IPA|/eɯ̯/, IPA|/ɤɯ̯/, IPA|/ʊɯ̯/, IPA|/oɯ̯/, IPA|/ɪɯ̯/, IPA|/æɯ̯/, IPA|/øɯ̯/, IPA|/ʉɯ̯/, IPA|/ae̯/. All other sequences of vowels were pronounced as separate syllables.

 Grammar 
The lexicon of the original Ithkuil consisted of the same pattern as the current form of the language. However, each root consisted of 2 consonantal ''radicals'', and could Derivation (linguistics)|derive thousands of lexemes through the use of Ithkuil's complex rules of morphophonology, which involved both consonant mutation|consonantal and vocal mutation, shifts in syllabic stress and tone, and affixation.

Ithkuil words can be divided into just two Part of speech|parts of speech, ''formatives'' and ''adjuncts''. Formatives functioned both as nouns and as verbs, depending on the morpho-semantic context. Formatives were inflected for the current grammatical categories, plus 2 Focus (linguistics)|''foci'', and 81 Grammatical case|''cases''; they could also have taken on some of the 153 affixes, which further qualified into one of 9 ''degrees''. Verbal formatives were additionally inflected for 7 ''conflations''.

''Verbal adjuncts'' similarly worked in conjunction with adjacent formatives to provide additional grammatical information. Two types of verbal adjuncts were inflected to indicate 14 Valency (linguistics)|''valencies'', 6 ''versions'', 8 ''formats'', 37 ''derivations'', 30 Linguistic modality|''modalities'', 4 Comparative|''levels'', 9 Evidentiality|''validations'', 9 ''phases'', 9 ''sanctions'', 32 Grammatical aspect|''aspects'', 8 Grammatical mood|''moods'', and 24 ''biases''.

An example of morphological analysis
:''(based entirely on the original Ithkuil grammar book)''

The word ''iţkuîl'' was a ''formative'' derived from the ''root'' ''k-l'' (broadly concerning "speech", "voice", or even "interpretation") through the addition of several morphological determinants:
* The -u- vocalic infix
:''kul'' was the ''holistic'' variety of the ''Stem 2'' of the three other possible stems from ''k-l''. Translating roughly as "a meaningful unit of speech", i.e. "a word", it gave no emphasis on the meaning or the vocal rendering of the word.
* The u → uî mutation of the infix
:''Secondary'' ''mode'', as opposed to ''primary'' ''mode'', meant that the word ''kuîl'' is not to refer to a real-life phenomenon, but rather to a mental representation, or projection, of that phenomenon; to an imaginary or hypothetical object. Thus translating as, "a made-up word".
* A ''grade 8'' mutation of the first radical consonant: k → ţk
:The ''configuration'' of the term was ''composite''. Roughly corresponding to the plurality concept in Indo-European languages, it also implies the objects in question (words, ''kuîl'') to be diverse, while forming a "coherent emergent entity" (rather than just a collection or an array of different words), thus meaning "a vocabulary" or "lexicon".
* The i- vocalic prefix, one of the 24 possible for formative roots
:The ''extension'' was ''delimitive'', perceiving "vocabulary" as entire, with clearly distinguished boundaries, as opposed to it being just a local manifestationspaced ndashsuch as slang or a dialectspaced ndashof a broader lexicon (''-ţkuîl'').
:The ''affiliation'' of the set of objects in question was ''coalescent''. This indicates that the individual members of the set act together toward a higher purpose by coordinating their complementary functions. Thus, "a vocabulary/lexicon" becomes "a language".
* Stress (linguistics)|Syllabic stress on the penultimate syllable (''-u-'')
:The ''perspective'' of the noun is ''monadic'', seeing "the language" as a single and specific entity, rather than a collection of many languages existing separately, the general phenomenon ("human languages") or the abstract idea of language.
Thus, the approximate translation of ''iţkuîl'' was "an idea/fantasy of a complete purposeful system of complementary speech elements", or simply "an imaginary language".

In an effort to make the language more speakable, Quijada created a revision called ''Ilaksh''.

 Phonology 
The phonology|phonological system of Ilaksh was revised to consist of only 30 consonants and 10 vowels. The consonants were as follows:

Possible advantages
The Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis postulates that a person's language influences their perceptions and cognitive patterns. Stanislav Kozlovsky proposed<ref name=kozl>(Russian) [http://old.computerra.ru/xterra/205420/ «Скорость мысли», Станислав Козловский] – ''Speed of thought'' by Stanislav Kozlovsky, ''Computerra'', &#8470;26–27, June 20, 2004</ref> in the Russian popular-scientific magazine ''Computerra'' that a fluent speaker of Ithkuil, accordingly, would think "about five or six times as fast" as a speaker of a typical natural language. The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis would suggest that, Ithkuil being an extremely precise and synthetic language, its speakers would have a more discerning, deeper understanding both of everyday situations and of broader phenomena, and of abstract philosophy|philosophical categories.

However, strong forms of the hypothesis, which postulate that language ''determines'' thought and not only influences it, have been disproven within mainstream linguistics.<ref>Citation|last=Ahearn|first=Laura|title=Living language: an introduction to linguistic anthropology|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=9781405124416|page=69|edition=1. publ.</ref> Moreover, in line with this, Quijada has stated he does not believe a speaker would think necessarily any faster, because even though Ithkuil is terse, a single word requires a lot more thought before it can be spoken than it would in a natural language.<ref name=FAQ>[http://www.ithkuil.net/faqs.html FAQ]</ref>

"For these reasons, I believe use of Ithkuil would probably allow one to think more deeply, critically, and analytically; but think faster? I doubt it."

Kozlovsky also likened Ithkuil to the fictional ''Speedtalk'' from Robert A. Heinlein's novella ''Gulf (Heinlein)|Gulf'', and contrasted both languages with the ''Newspeak'' of the communicationally restricted society of George Orwell|Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. Ithkuil is by far the most complete language of the three, though Speedtalk and Newspeak were merely "sampled" by their creators, with an outline of neither grammar nor lexicon. John Quijada acknowledged the similarity of Ithkuil's design goals to those of Speedtalk,<ref name="faqs" /> remarking that,

"[h]owever, Heinlein's Speedtalk appears to focus only on the morpho-phonological component of language[, whereas] Ithkuil has been designed with an equal focus on [morphology, lexico-morphology, or lexico-semantics]. Additionally, the apparent purpose of Heinlein's language is simple rapidity/brevity of speech and thought, while Ithkuil is focused on maximal communication in the most efficient manner, a somewhat different purpose, in which brevity per se is irrelevant."
