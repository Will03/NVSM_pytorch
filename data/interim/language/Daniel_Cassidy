''Billboard'' said, "Dan Cassidy projects an immense strength and a rare understanding of the human predicament circa early 1970s on this his initial album effort.

Reviews
<blockquote>Cassidy's book is one of those eureka moments that leap beyond the ordinary to give us a new understanding of the subject at hand.<ref>[http://thebestamericanpoetry.typepad.com/the_best_american_poetry/2009/07/daniel-cassidy-theres-a-s%C3%A1ch-%C3%BAr-born-every-minute-terence-winch.html "Daniel Cassidy: There’s a Sách úr Born Every Minute", ''Best American Poetry'', Terence Winch, July 07, 2009]</ref></blockquote>
<blockquote>So utterly, completely stupid, only a total nincompoop like Cassidy could have come up with it.<ref>http://cassidyslangscam.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/block/</ref></blockquote>
<blockquote>… the problem with the book is that there is no scholarship or real evidence at all in it.<ref>http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005098.html</ref></blockquote>
<blockquote>Tá Cassidy imithe ar shlí na fírinne anois, is é mo mhórdhóchas ná go n-imeoidh na bréaga seo leis. Ná ceannaigh an leabhar seo is ná tacaigh le seafóid mar seo. (Cassidy has passed away now, it is my fervent hope that these lies will pass away with him. Do not buy this book and do not support nonsense like this.)<ref>https://antuairisceoir.com/2014/07/15/how-daniel-cassidy-invented-etymology-leirmheas/</ref></blockquote>
<blockquote>Cassidy&rsquo;s main thesis&mdash;that there are far more English words of Irish origin than are acknowledged in volumes such as the OED, and that this is due to the fact that much of the Irish influence is found among lower-status, colloquial slang expressions&mdash;is very convincing, but the etymologies he proposes for individual words would require a substantial amount of research before they could be taken as fact.<ref>cite journal|last1=MacDougall|first1=Heather|title=Review of How the Irish Invented Slang: The Secret Language of the Crossroads|journal=The Canadian Journal of Irish Studies|date=Fall 2007|volume=33|issue=2|page=74|doi=10.2307/25515689|jstor=25515689</ref></blockquote>
<blockquote>Cassidy paints himself as the maligned scholar, the unappreciated genius, the outsider. He may be all of those things, but he is them by choice: his work cannot withstand scholarly scrutiny so he simply cannot afford to join forces with any larger body of experts who do this sort of thing for a living. His book falls apart on first reading by anyone with some expertise in the field.<ref>cite web|url=http://grantbarrett.com/humdinger-of-a-bad-irish-scholar |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hk5lQbBe?url=http://grantbarrett.com/humdinger-of-a-bad-irish-scholar |archivedate=June 29, 2013 |df=mdy </ref></blockquote>

Criticism
Etymologies from Cassidy's ''How the Irish Invented Slang'' are widely duplicated across the internet. However, many of Cassidy's definitions have been shown to be at best wishful thinking or complete fabrications.<ref>[http://cassidyslangscam.wordpress.com/ cassidyslangscam: A debunking of Daniel Cassidy's theories about Irish and slang], [https://www.webcitation.org/6Hk5cptFl?url=http://cassidyslangscam.wordpress.com/ archived] June 29, 2013.</ref> Cassidy was not able to speak Irish language|Irish himself and was unfamiliar with the grammatical rules.<ref>[http://cassidyslangscam.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/the-great-daniel-cassidy-slang-scam/ The Great Daniel Cassidy Slang Scam!], March 18, 2013, [https://www.webcitation.org/6Hk5iJMrZ?url=http://cassidyslangscam.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/the-great-daniel-cassidy-slang-scam/ archived] June 29, 2013.</ref> In many cases, he apparently found words in Irish dictionaries that he thought had a similar pronunciation to English words or phrases with a vaguely connected meaning.  He then claimed these English words to have an Irish origin even when the English word already had a well established etymology.<ref>John Madziarczyk, [http://www.losthighwaytimes.com/2007/08/as-promised-side-by-side-comparison-of.html Book Review of "How the Irish Invented Slang" Part II—Side by side definition comparisons.], August 9, 2007, [https://www.webcitation.org/6Hk5rLGUh?url=http://www.losthighwaytimes.com/2007/08/as-promised-side-by-side-comparison-of.html archived] June 29, 2013.</ref> However, in the majority of cases, he simply combined Irish words into phrases which he thought resembled English slang terms but without providing any evidence that these phrases ever existed in Irish Gaelic.

Although his theories appeal to the idea that the contributions of working class Irish immigrants to US English have been ignored by English-speaking lexicographers, they have been heavily criticized by academics.  These include the American lexicographer Grant Barrett<ref>Grant Barrett, [http://grantbarrett.com/humdinger-of-a-bad-irish-scholar Humdinger of a Bad Irish Scholar] webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hk5lQbBe?url=http://grantbarrett.com/humdinger-of-a-bad-irish-scholar |date=June 29, 2013 , November 9, 2007, [https://www.webcitation.org/6Hk5lQbBe?url=http://grantbarrett.com/humdinger-of-a-bad-irish-scholar archived] June 29, 2013.</ref> and Irish lexicographer Terence Dolan, Professor of Old and Middle English at University College Dublin.<ref>Ed Power, [http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books-arts/how-we-gave-the-yanks-the-gift-of-our-gab-26442655.html How we gave the Yanks the gift of our gab], Independent.ie, December 4, 2007, [https://www.webcitation.org/6Hk5omh2c?url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books-arts/how-we-gave-the-yanks-the-gift-of-our-gab-26442655.html archived] June 29, 2013.</ref>
