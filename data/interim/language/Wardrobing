To prevent this practice, some stores make certain items, such as wedding dresses or Christmas decorations unreturnable. Some observers classify wardrobing as a form of shoplifting.

Examples
Perhaps one of the most notorious examples of wardrobing comes from the film ''My Date With Drew'', which was filmed entirely on a wardrobed video camera. The filmmaker purchased the camera from Circuit City (1949â€“2009 company)|Circuit City, used it for 30 days to film his movie, and then returned the camera for a full refund.
