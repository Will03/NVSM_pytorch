In Western countries, emoticons are usually written at a right angle to the direction of the text. Users from Japan popularized a kind of emoticon called kaomoji (:ja:顔文字|顔文字; lit. 顔(kao)=face, 文字(moji)=character(s)) that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986.<ref name="aist">cite web

As SMS and the internet became widespread in the late 1990s, emoticons became increasingly popular and were commonly used on text messages, internet forums and email|e-mails. Emoticons have played a significant role in communication through technology, and some devices and applications have provided stylized pictures that do not use text punctuation. They offer another range of "tone" and feeling through texting that portrays specific emotions through facial gestures while in the midst of text-based cyber communication.<ref>cite news

 Origin of the term 
The word is a portmanteau word of the English language|English words "emotion" and "icon". In web forums, instant messaging|instant messengers and online games, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images, which came to be called "emoticons" as well. Emoticons for a smiley face <code>:-)</code> and sad face <code>:-(</code> appear in the first documented use in digital form. Certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in non-Latin scripts, giving rise to especially complex forms, sometimes known by their romanized Japanese name of kaomoji.

The use of emoticons can be traced back to the 17th century, drawn by a Slovaks|Slovak notary to indicate his satisfaction with the state of his town's municipal financial records in 1635,<ref>cite web

The ''National Telegraphic Review and Operators Guide'' in April 1857 documented the use of the number 73 in Morse code to express "love and kisses" (later reduced to the more formal "best regards"). ''Dodge's Manual'' in 1908 documented the reintroduction of "love and kisses" as the number 88. Gajadhar and Green comment that both Morse code abbreviations are more succinct than modern abbreviations such as LOL (Internet slang)|LOL.<ref>cite journal

Four vertical typographical emoticons were published in 1881 by the U.S. satirical magazine ''Puck (magazine)|Puck'', with the stated intention that the publication's letterpress department thus intended to "lay out [...] all the cartoonists that ever walked".

In 1912, Ambrose Bierce proposed "an improvement in punctuation&nbsp;– the snigger point, or note of wikt:cachinnation|cachinnation: it is written thus&nbsp;‿ and presents a smiling mouth. It is to be appended, with the full stop, to every jocular or ironical sentence".<ref>cite book

In a 1936 ''The Harvard Lampoon|Harvard Lampoon'' article, Alan Gregg proposed (-) for smile, (--) for laugh (more teeth showing), (#) for frown, (*) for wink, and (#) for "intense interest, attention, and incredulity".<ref>The Harvard Lampoon, Vol. 112 No. 1, September 16, 1936, pp. 30-31</ref> Note that the symbols are correctly oriented and are not sideways.

Emoticons had already come into use in sci-fi fandom in the 1940s,<ref>Gregory Benford, "A Scientist's Notebook: net@fandom.com", ''The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction'', Vol. 90, No. 6 (June 1996), p. 90</ref> although there seems to have been a lapse in cultural continuity between the communities.

The September 1962 issue of Mad (magazine)|''MAD'' magazine included an article titled "Typewri-toons". The piece, featuring typewriter-generated artwork credited to "Royal Portable", was entirely made up of repurposed typography, including a capital letter P having a bigger bust than a capital I, a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies, an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from a snowfall, and a classroom of lowercase n's interrupted by a lowercase h "raising its hand".<ref>MAD Magazine No. 73, Sept. 1962, EC Publications, pp. 36-37</ref> Two additional "Typewri-toons" articles subsequently appeared in ''Mad'', in 1965 and 1987.

In 1963, the "smiley face", a yellow button with two black dots representing eyes and an upturned thick curve representing a mouth was created by freelance artist Harvey Ball. It was realized on order of a large insurance company as part of a campaign to bolster the morale of its employees and soon became a big hit. This smiley presumably inspired many later emoticons; the most basic graphic emoticon that depicts this is, in fact, a small yellow smiley face.

In a ''New York Times'' interview in April 1969, Alden Whitman asked writer Vladimir Nabokov: "How do you rank yourself among writers (living) and of the immediate past?" Nabokov answered: "I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile&nbsp;– some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question."<ref>cite book

In 2001, Walmart opposed the registration, citing a likelihood of confusion between the Loufrani smiley and a smiley face Walmart had been using since 1990. The USPTO eventually sided with Walmart and rejected The Smiley Company's application, due to the widespread use of smiley face designs. Seeking to prevent Walmart from using any smiley face design, Nicolas Loufrani next sued Walmart in federal court in 2009, while claiming that his smiley face was "readily distinguishable" from Walmart's. The case was closed in 2011 when the two parties agreed to settle out of court.

Starting circa 1972, on the PLATO (computer system)|PLATO system, emoticons and other decorative graphics were produced as ASCII art, particularly with ASCII art#Overprinting (surprint)|overprinting: typing a character, backing up, then typing another character. For example, WOBTAX and VICTORY both produced convincing smiley faces (where the overprinted characters produced the solid background, and pixels untouched by any of the characters produced the actual design).

</ref> Many variations on the theme were immediately suggested by Scott and others.

 Western style 
Usually, emoticons in Western style have the eyes on the left, followed by nose and the mouth. The two character version <code>:)</code> which omits the nose is also very popular.

= Common Western examples =
<!-- linked from redirect Less than three -->
Main|List of emoticonsThe most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny ambigrams), with or without a hyphen (nose).
There are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. For example, <code>:(</code> equals sad and <code>:((</code> equals very sad. Weeping can be written as <code>:'(</code>. A blush can be expressed as <code>:"></code>. Others include wink <code>;)</code>, a grin <code>:D</code>, smug <code>:-></code>, and tongue out <code>:P</code>, such as when blowing a raspberry. An often used combination is also <code><3</code> for a heart, and <code></3</code> for a broken heart. <code>:O</code> is also sometimes used to depict shock.

A broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; <code>XD</code> and the addition of further "D" letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e.g. <code>XDDDD</code>. There are hundreds of other variations including <code>>:(</code> for anger, or <code>>:D</code> for an evil grin, which can be, again, used in reverse, for an unhappy angry face, in the shape of <code>D:<</code>. <code>=K</code> for vampire teeth, <code>:s</code> for grimace, and <code>;P</code> can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a double entendre|second meaning in the sentence preceding it.<ref>Dresner & Herring (2010).</ref>

As computers offer increasing built-in support for non-Western writing systems, it has become possible to use other glyphs to build emoticons. The 'shrug' emoticon, <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>, uses the glyph ツ from the Japanese katakana writing system.

= Variation =
Main|ASCII art

An equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as <code>=)</code>, without changing the meaning of the emoticon. In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an "o" as in <code>=O)</code> . In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes,<ref>cite web

</ref> Similar-looking characters are commonly substituted for one another: for instance, <code>o</code>, <code>O</code>, and <code>0</code> can all be used interchangeably, sometimes for subtly different effect or, in some cases, one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another. It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other, similar brackets, such as <code>]</code> instead of <code>)</code>.

Some variants are also more common in certain countries due to keyboard layouts. For example, the smiley <code>=)</code> may occur in Scandinavia, where the keys for <code>=</code> and <code>)</code> are placed right beside each other. However, the <code>:)</code> variant is without a doubt the dominant one in Scandinavia, making the <code>=)</code> version a rarity. Diacritical marks are sometimes used. The letters <code>Ö</code> and <code>Ü</code> can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of <code>:O</code> (meaning that one is surprised) and <code>:D</code> (meaning that one is very happy) respectively.

Some emoticons may be read right to left instead, and in fact can only be written using standard ASCII keyboard characters this way round; for example <code>D:</code> which refers to being shocked or anxious, opposite to the large grin of <code>:D</code>.

These emoticons are usually found in a format similar to <code>(*_*)</code>. The asterisks indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an underscore, the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face.

Different emotions can be expressed by changing the character representing the eyes: for example, "T" can be used to express crying or sadness: <code>(T_T)</code>. <code>T_T</code> may also be used to mean "unimpressed".  The emphasis on the eyes in this style is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes, e.g. <code>^^</code>.

</ref> Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, "cuter" mouth, or to represent a nose, e.g. <code>(^.^)</code>. Alternatively, the mouth/nose can be left out entirely, e.g. <code>(^^)</code>.

Parentheses are sometimes replaced with Bracket#Curly brackets|braces or Bracket#Square brackets|square brackets, e.g. <code>{^_^}</code> or <code>[o_0]</code>. Many times, the parentheses are left out completely, e.g. <code>^^</code>,<code> >.< </code>, <code>o_O</code>, <code>O.O</code>, <code>e_e</code>, or <code>e.e</code>. A quotation mark <code>"</code>, apostrophe <code>'</code>, or semicolon <code>;</code> can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a sweat drop is used in manga and anime.

Microsoft Input method editor|IME 2000 (Japanese) or later supports the input of emoticons like the above by enabling the Microsoft IME Spoken Language/Emotion Dictionary.  In IME 2007, this support was moved to the Emoticons dictionary.  Such dictionaries allow users to call up emoticons by typing words that represent them.

Communication software allowing the use of Shift JIS encoded Japanese characters rather than just ASCII allowed for the development of new kaomoji using the extended character set, such as <code>(^ム^)</code> or <code>(益)</code>.

Modern communication software generally utilizes Unicode, which allows for the incorporation of characters from other languages (e.g. from the Cyrillic alphabet), and a variety of symbols into the kaomoji, as in <code>(`Д´)</code> or <code>(◕‿◕✿)</code>.

Further variations can be produced using Unicode combining characters, as in <code>٩(͡๏̯͡๏)۶</code> or <code> ᶘᵒᴥᵒᶅ</code>.

= Western use of Japanese style =
English-language anime forums adopted those Japanese-style emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on Western keyboards.  Because of this, they are often called "anime style" emoticons in Englishcitation needed|date=May 2018.  They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and non-anime-related discussion forums.  Emoticons such as <code><(&nbsp;^.^&nbsp;)></code>, <code><(^_^<)</code>, <code><(o_o<)</code>, <code><(&nbsp;-'.'-&nbsp;)></code>, <code><('.'-^)</code>, or <code>(>';..;')></code> which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs < or >) also are often referred to as "not a typo|Kirbys" in reference to their likeness to Nintendo's video game character Kirby (Nintendo)|Kirby.  The parentheses are sometimes dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an intensifier for the emoticon in question, e.g. <code>^_________^</code> for very happy. The emoticon nowrap|<code>t(-_-t)</code> uses the Eastern style, but incorporates a depiction of the Western The finger|"middle-finger flick-off" using a "t" as the arm, hand, and finger. Another apparently Western invention is the use of emoticons like <code>*,..,*</code> or <code>`;..;´</code> to indicate vampires or other mythical beasts with fangs.

= Mixture of Western and Japanese style =
Exposure to both Western and Japanese style emoticons or kaomoji through blogs, instant messaging, and forums featuring a blend of Western and Japanese pop culture has given rise to many emoticons that have an upright viewing format.  The parentheses are often dropped, and these emoticons typically only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as <code>-O-</code>, <code>-3-</code>, <code>-w-</code>, <code>'_'</code>, <code>;_;</code>, <code>T_T</code>, <code>:></code>, and <code>.V.</code> are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime- or manga-styled sweat drop, for example <code>^_^'</code>, <code>!>_<!</code>, <code><@>_____<@>;;</code>, <code>;O;</code>, and <code>*u*</code>.  The equals sign can also be used for closed, anime-looking eyes, for example <code>=0=</code>, <code>=3=</code>, <code>=w=</code>, <code>=A=</code>, and <code>=7=</code>.

In Brazil, sometimes combining characters (accents) are added to emoticons to represent eyebrows, as in <code>ò_ó</code>, <code>ó_ò</code>, <code>õ_o</code>, <code>ù_u</code>, or <code>o_Ô</code>.

= 2channel style =
<!-- linked from redirect ಠ ಠ -->
Users of the Japanese discussion board 2channel, in particular, have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from various languages, such as Kannada alphabet|Kannada, as in  <code>ಠ_ಠ</code> (for a look of disapproval, disbelief, or confusion).  These were quickly picked up by 4chan and spread to other Western sites soon after.  Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like Mona (ASCII art)|Monā.

 Korean style 
In South Korea, emoticons use Korean Hangul letters, and the Western style is rarely used. The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences. Korean style contains Korean jamo (letters) instead of other characters. There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamo letters. Consonant jamos <code>ㅅ</code>, <code>ㅁ</code> or <code>ㅂ</code> as the mouth/nose component and <code>ㅇ</code>, <code>ㅎ</code> or <code>ㅍ</code> for the eyes. For example: <code>ㅇㅅㅇ</code>, <code>ㅇㅂㅇ</code>, <code>ㅇㅁㅇ</code> and <code>-ㅅ-</code>. Faces such as <code>'ㅅ'</code>, <code>"ㅅ"</code>, <code>'ㅂ'</code> and <code>'ㅇ'</code>, using quotation marks <code>"</code> and apostrophes <code>'</code> are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as ㅜ,ㅠ depict a crying face. Example: <code>ㅜㅜ</code>, <code>ㅠㅠ</code> and <code>뉴뉴</code> (same function as T in western style). Sometimes ㅡ (not an em-dash "—" but a vowel jamo), a comma or an underscore is added, and the two character sets can be mixed together, as in <code>ㅜ.ㅜ</code>, <code>ㅠ.ㅜ</code>, <code>ㅠ.ㅡ</code>, <code>ㅜ_ㅠ</code>, <code>ㅡ^ㅜ</code> and <code>ㅜㅇㅡ</code>. Also, semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons; semicolons mean sweating (embarrassed). If they are used with ㅡ or – they depict a bad feeling. Examples: <code>-;/</code>, <code>--^</code>, <code>ㅡㅡ;;;</code>, <code>-_-;;</code> and <code>-_^</code>. However, <code>^^, ^오^</code> means smile (almost all people use this without distinction of sex or age). Others include: <code>~_~</code>, <code>--a</code>, <code>-6-</code>, <code>+0+</code>.

In 2007, MTV and Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment promoted the "emoticlip" as a form of viral marketing for the second season of the show ''The Hills''. The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show, uploaded to YouTube, which the advertisers hoped would be distributed between web users as a way of expressing feelings in a similar manner to emoticons.

During the first half of the 2010s, there have been different forms of small audiovisual pieces to be sent through instant messaging systems to express one's emotion. These videos lack an established name, and there are several ways to designate them: "emoticlips" (named above), "emotivideos" or more recently "emoticon videos". These are tiny videos which can be easily transferred from one mobile phone or other device to another. Current video compression codecs such as H.264 allow these pieces of video to be light in terms of file size and very portable. The popular computer and mobile app Skype uses these in a separate keyboard or by typing the code of the "emoticon videos" between parentheses.

In 2000, Despair, Inc. obtained a U.S. trademark registration for the "frowny" emoticon <code>:-(</code> when used on "greeting cards, posters and art prints".
