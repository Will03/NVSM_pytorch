Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence, defined as intelligence exhibited by machines, has many applications in today's society.  More specifically,  it is Weak AI, the form of AI where programs are developed to perform specific tasks, that is being utilized for a wide range of activities including medical diagnosis, electronic trading, robot control, and remote sensing.  AI has been used to develop and advance numerous fields and industries, including finance, healthcare, education, transportation, and more.

 AI for Good 
AI for Good is a movement in which institutions are employing AI to tackle some of the world's greatest economic and social challenges.  For example, the University of Southern California launched the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society, with the goal of using AI to address socially relevant problems such as homelessness.  At Stanford, researchers are using AI to analyze satellite images to identify which areas have the highest poverty levels.<ref name=":03">United States, National Science and Technology Council – Committee on Technology.

The Air and Space Operations Center|Air Operations Division (AOD) uses AI for the rule based expert systems. The AOD has use for artificial intelligence for surrogate operators for combat and training simulators, mission management aids, support systems for tactical decision making, and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries.<ref>Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/ai-bests-air-force-combat-tactics-experts-in-simulated-dogfights/|title=AI bests Air Force combat tactics experts in simulated dogfights|access-date=2016-11-18|newspaper=Ars Technica</ref>

The use of artificial intelligence in simulators is proving to be very useful for the AOD. Airplane simulators are using artificial intelligence in order to process the data taken from simulated flights. Other than simulated flying, there is also simulated aircraft warfare. The computers are able to come up with the best success scenarios in these situations. The computers can also create strategies based on the placement, size, speed and strength of the forces and counter forces. Pilots may be given assistance in the air during combat by computers. The artificial intelligent programs can sort the information and provide the pilot with the best possible maneuvers, not to mention getting rid of certain maneuvers that would be impossible for a human being to perform. Multiple aircraft are needed to get good approximations for some calculations so computer simulated pilots are used to gather data.<ref>Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Randolph M.|last2=Laird|first2=John E.|last3=Nielsen|first3=Paul E.|last4=Coulter|first4=Karen J.|last5=Kenny|first5=Patrick|last6=Koss|first6=Frank V.|date=1999-03-15|title=Automated Intelligent Pilots for Combat Flight Simulation|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/1438|journal=AI Magazine|volume=20|issue=1|pages=27|issn=0738-4602</ref> These computer simulated pilots are also used to train future air traffic controllers.

The system used by the AOD in order to measure performance was the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS. It is a rule based expert system put together by collecting information from TF-30 documents and the expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was designed to be used for the development of the TF-30 for the RAAF F-111C. The performance system was also used to replace specialized workers. The system allowed the regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having to speak to one of the specialized workers.

The AOD also uses artificial intelligence in speech recognition software. The air traffic controllers are giving directions to the artificial pilots and the AOD wants to the pilots to respond to the ATC's with simple responses. The programs that incorporate the speech software must be trained, which means they use neural networks. The program used, the Verbex 7000, is still a very early program that has plenty of room for improvement. The improvements are imperative because ATCs use very specific dialog and the software needs to be able to communicate correctly and promptly every time.

The Artificial Intelligence supported Design of Aircraft,<ref>[http://www.kbs.twi.tudelft.nl/Research/Projects/AIDA/ AIDA Homepage]. Kbs.twi.tudelft.nl (April 17, 1997). Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref>  or AIDA, is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools. The AIDA uses rule based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is proving effective.

In 2003, NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, and many other companies, created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to continue flight until a safe landing zone can be reached.<ref>[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/crgis/images/c/c9/88798main_srfcs.pdf The Story of Self-Repairing Flight Control Systems.] NASA Dryden. (April 2003). Retrieved on 2016-08-25.</ref> The software compensates for all the damaged components by relying on the undamaged components. The neural network used in the software proved to be effective and marked a triumph for artificial intelligence.

The Integrated Vehicle Health Management system, also used by NASA, on board an aircraft must process and interpret data taken from the various sensors on the aircraft. The system needs to be able to determine the structural integrity of the aircraft. The system also needs to implement protocols in case of any damage taken the vehicle.<ref>Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20010055588.pdf|title=Flight Demonstration Of X-33 Vehicle Health Management System Components On The F/A-18 Systems Research Aircraft|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=</ref>

Haitham Baomar and Peter Bentley are leading a team from the University College of London to develop an artificial intelligence based Intelligent Autopilot System (IAS) designed to teach an autopilot system to behave like a highly experienced pilot who is faced with an emergency situation such as severe weather, turbulence, or system failure.<ref name=":0">Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/ai-wields-power-make-flying-safer-maybe-even-pleasant/|title=AI Wields the Power to Make Flying Safer—and Maybe Even Pleasant|last=Adams|first=Eric|date=March 28, 2017|journal=Wired|access-date=October 7, 2017</ref> Educating the autopilot relies on the concept of supervised machine learning “which treats the young autopilot as a human apprentice going to a flying school”.<ref name=":0" /> The autopilot records the actions of the human pilot generating learning models using artificial neural networks.<ref name=":0" /> The autopilot is then given full control and observed by the pilot as it executes the training exercise.<ref name=":0" />

 Computer science 
AI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. Many of their inventions have been adopted by mainstream computer science and are no longer considered a part of AI. (See AI effect.) According to Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=15, all of the following were originally developed in AI laboratories:
time sharing,
Interpreted language|interactive interpreters,
graphical user interfaces and the computer mouse,
Rapid application development|rapid development environments,
the linked list data structure,
automatic storage management,
Third-generation programming language|symbolic programming,
functional programming,
dynamic programming and
object-oriented programming.

AI can be used to create other AI. For example, around November 2017, Google's AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and COCO. According to Google, NASNet's performance exceeded all previously published ImageNet performance.<ref>cite news|title=Google AI creates its own ‘child’ bot|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-child-ai-bot-nasnet-automl-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-a8093201.html|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=The Independent|date=5 December 2017</ref>

 Education 
<big>The Future of AI in the classroom</big>

The future of AI in the classroom is looking bright.Opinion|date=January 2019 One of the most exciting innovations is the idea of a personal AI tutor or assistant for each individual student.Opinion|date=January 2019 Because a single teacher can’t work with every student at once, AI tutors would allow for students to get extra, one-on-one help in areas of needed growth. AI tutors also eliminate the intimidating idea of tutor labs or human tutors which can cause anxiety and stress for some students.<ref>cite web|url=https://elearningindustry.com/artificial-intelligence-in-the-classroom-role|title=The Role Of Artificial Intelligence In The Classroom|date=14 April 2018|website=eLearning Industry|accessdate=14 January 2019</ref> In future classrooms, ambient informatics can play a beneficial role. Ambient informatics is the idea that information is everywhere in the environment and that technologies automatically adjust to your personal preferences. <ref name="auto">Smith, Lawrence. “Everyware.” Prezi.com, 10 Jan. 2019, prezi.com/ai2kkqkeolus/everyware-technopoly/</ref>  When students sit at their desk, their devices will be able to create lessons, problems, and games to tailor to the specific student’s needs, particularly where a student may be struggling, and give immediate feedback. This eliminates the idea of a “one-size-fits-all classroom” as we will no longer have to force students to learn the exact same material at the exact same pace. While there are many benefits to the use of AI in the classroom, there are also several dangers that need to be taken into account before implementing them.

As far as the future of AI in education, there are many new possibilities due to what has been coined by The New York Times as “The Great AI Awakening.” One of these possibilities mentioned by Forbes included the providing of adaptive learning programs, which assess and react to a student’s emotions and learning preferences. Another advancement includes the presentation of performance data and enrichment methods on an individual basis. Within curriculum, AI could help determine if there are underlying biases in texts and instructions. For teachers, AI could soon have the power to relay data regarding efficacy of varying learning interventions from a, potentially, global database. As a whole AI has the power to influence education by taking district, state, national, and global data into consideration as it seeks to better individualize learning for all. Although AI can provide many assets to a classroom, many experts still agree that they will not be able to replace teachers altogether.  

Many teachers fear the idea of AI replacing them in the classroom, especially with the idea of personal AI assistants for each student. The reality is, AI can create a more dystopian environment with revenge effects. This means that technology is inhibiting society from moving forward and causing negative, unintended effects on society.<ref>Quan-Haase, Anabel. Technology and Society: Social Networks, Power, and Inequality. 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, 2016. Pg. 43-44.</ref> An example of a revenge effect is that the extended use of technology may hinder students’ ability to focus and stay on task instead of helping them learn and grow.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/technology/21brain.html?pagewanted=1&_r=3. Richtel, Matt. “Growing Up Digital, Wired for Distraction.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 21 Nov. 2010]</ref> Also, AI has been known to lead to the loss of both human agency and simultaneity.<ref name="auto"/> If students are relying solely on AI tutors composed of algorithms and wires, it reduces their ability to control their own education and learning. Also, the need for AI technologies to work simultaneously may lead to system failures which could ruin an entire school day if we are relying on AI assistants to create lessons for students every day. It is inevitable that AI technologies will be taking over the classroom in the years to come, thus it is essential that the kinks of these new innovations are worked out before teachers decide whether or not to implement them into their daily schedules.

= Algorithmic trading =
Algorithmic trading involves the use of complex AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds several orders of magnitudes greater than any human is capable of, often making millions of trades in a day without any human intervention. Such trading is called High-frequency Trading, and it represents one of the fastest growing sectors in financial trading. Many banks, funds, and proprietary trading firms now have entire portfolios which are managed purely by AI systems. Automated trading systems are typically used by large institutional investors, but recent years have also seen an influx of smaller, proprietary firms trading with their own AI systems.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/algorithmictrading.asp|title=Algorithmic Trading|last=|first=|date=2005-05-18|website=Investopedia|access-date=</ref>

= History =
The 1980s is really when AI started to become prominent in the finance world. This is when Expert Systems became more of a commercial product in the financial field. “For example, Dupont had built 100 expert systems which helped them save close to $10 million a year.”<ref>cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124438804500454|title=History and applications|date=1 January 2002|publisher=|journal=Expert Systems|pages=1–22|access-date=14 January 2019|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/B978-012443880-4/50045-4</ref> One of the first systems was the Protrader expert system designed by K.C. Chen and Ting-peng Lian that was able to predict the 87-point drop in DOW Jones Industrial Average in 1986. “The major junctions of the system were to monitor premiums in the market, determine the optimum investment strategy, execute transactions when appropriate and modify the knowledge base through a learning mechanism.”<ref>http://www.ecrc.nsysu.edu.tw/liang/paper/3/PROTRADER%20An%20Expert%20System%20for%20Program%20Trading.pdf</ref> One of the first expert systems that helped with financial plans was created by Applied Expert Systems (APEX) called the PlanPower. It was first commercially shipped in 1986. Its function was to help give financial plans for people with incomes over $75,000 a year. That then led to the Client Profiling System that was used for incomes between $25,000 and $200,000 a year.<ref>https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?site=eds&scope=site&jrnl=10403981&AN=5560302&h=RWiKgQS2d%2fxcTfEjKLsBbkQ%2busFvJr90vu%2fRD0b05cxxv94ZMN1ylDkaz3hVwq42P8MOkiBJ10%2bH1T1w%2b6T2NQ%3d%3d&crl=f&resultLocal=ErrCrlNoResults&resultNs=Ehost&crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d10403981%26AN%3d5560302</ref> The 1990s was a lot more about fraud detection. One of the systems that was started in 1993 was the FinCEN Artificial Intelligence system (FAIS). It was able to review over 200,000 transactions per week and over two years it helped identify 400 potential cases of money laundering which would have been equal to $1 billion.<ref>https://www.aaai.org/Papers/IAAI/1995/IAAI95-015.pdf</ref> Although Expert Systems didn’t last in the finance world, it did help jump-start the use of AI and help make it what it is today.

Robots have become common in many industries and are often given jobs that are considered dangerous to humans. Robots have proven effective in jobs that are very repetitive which may lead to mistakes or accidents due to a lapse in concentration and other jobs which humans may find degrading.

In 2014, China, Japan, the United States, the Republic of Korea and Germany together amounted to 70% of the total sales volume of robots.

Artificial neural networks are used as clinical decision support systems for medical diagnosis, such as in Concept Processing technology in electronic medical record|EMR software.

Other tasks in medicine that can potentially be performed by artificial intelligence and are beginning to be developed include:

*Computer-aided radiologic interpretation|Computer-aided interpretation of medical images.

 Human resources and recruiting 
Another application of AI is in the human resources and recruiting space. There are three ways AI is being used by human resources and recruiting professionals: to screen resumes and rank candidates according to their level of qualification, to predict candidate success in given roles through job matching platforms, and now rolling out recruiting chat bots that can automate repetitive communication tasks.

Typically, resume screening involves a recruiter or other HR professional scanning through a database of resumes. Now startups like Pomato are creating machine learning algorithms to automate resume screening processes. Pomato’s resume screening AI focuses on automating validating technical applicants for technical staffing firms. Pomato’s AI performs over 200,000 computations on each resume in seconds then designs a custom technical interview based on the mined skills. KE Solutions, founded in 2014, has developed recommendation systems to rank jobs for candidates, and rank resumes for employers. jobster.io, developed by KE Solutions, uses concept-based search that has increased accuracy by 80% compared to traditional ATS. It helps recruiters to overcome technical barriers.

From 2016 to 2017, consumer goods company Unilever used artificial intelligence to screen all entry-level employees. Unilever’s AI used neuroscience-based games, recorded interviews, and facial and speech analysis to predict hiring success. Unilever partnered with Pymetrics and HireVue to enable its AI-based screening and increased their applicants from 15,000 to 30,000 in a single year. Recruiting with AI produced Unililever’s “most diverse class to date’. Unilever also decreased time to hire from 4 months to four weeks and saved over 50,000 hours of recruiter time.

From resume screening to neuroscience, speech recognition, and facial analysis, AI is having a massive impact on the human resources field. Yet another development in AI is in recruiting chatbots. TextRecruit, a Bay Area startup, released Ari (automated recruiting interface.) Ari is a recruiting chatbot that is designed to hold two-way text message conversations with candidates. Ari automates posting jobs, advertising openings, screening candidates, scheduling interviews, and nurturing candidate relationships with updates as they progress along the hiring funnel. Ari is currently offered as part of TextRecruit’s candidate engagement platform.

 Job search 
The job market has seen a notable change due to artificial intelligence implementation. It has simplified the process for both recruiters and job seekers (i.e., Google for Jobs and applying online). According to Raj Mukherjee from Indeed.com, 65% of people launch a job search again within 91 days of being hired. AI-powered engine streamlines the complexity of job hunting by operating information on job skills, salaries, and user tendencies, matching people to the most relevant positions. Machine intelligence calculates what wages would be appropriate for a particular job, pulls and highlights resume information for recruiters using natural language processing, which extracts relevant words and phrases from text using specialized software. Another application is an AI resume builder which requires 5 minutes to compile a CV as opposed to spending hours doing the same job.
In the AI age chatbots assist website visitors and solve daily workflows. Revolutionary AI tools complement people’s skills and allow HR managers to focus on tasks of higher priority. However, Artificial Intelligence impact on jobs research suggests that by 2030 intelligent agents and robots can eliminate 30% of the world’s human labor. Moreover, the research proves automation will displace between 400 and 800 million employees. Glassdoor`s research report states that recruiting and HR are expected to see much broader adoption of AI in job market 2018 and beyond.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2018/02/02/the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-future-of-job-search|title=Raj Mukherjee|last=|first=|date=|website=Forbes|access-date=</ref><ref>Cite web|url=https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/Final_GD_ResearchReport_5Disruptions2018.pdf|title=Glassdoor's|last=|first=|date=|website=Glassdoor|access-date=</ref>

 Marketing 
Main|Marketing and artificial intelligence

 Media and e-commerce 
Some AI applications are geared towards the analysis of audiovisual media content such as movies, TV programs, advertisement videos or user-generated content. The solutions often involve computer vision, which is a major application area of AI.

Typical use case scenarios include the analysis of images using object recognition or face recognition techniques, or the video content analysis|analysis of video for recognizing relevant scenes, objects or faces. The motivation for using AI-based media analysis can be — among other things — the facilitation of media search, the creation of a set of descriptive keywords for a media item, media content policy monitoring (such as verifying the suitability of content for a particular TV viewing time), speech recognition|speech to text for archival or other purposes, and the detection of logos, products or celebrity faces for the placement of relevant advertisements.

 Music 
main|Music and artificial intelligence
While the evolution of music has always been affected by technology, artificial intelligence has enabled, through scientific advances, to emulate, at some extent, human-like composition.

Among notable early efforts, David Cope created an AI called Emily Howell that managed to become well known in the field of Algorithmic Computer Music.<ref name="ARS">cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/09/virtual-composer-makes-beautiful-musicand-stirs-controversy/|title=Virtual composer makes beautiful music—and stirs controversy|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui|publisher=Ars Technica|publication-date=30 September 2009</ref> The algorithm behind Emily Howell is registered as a US patent.<ref>US Patent #7696426 https://www.google.com/patents/US7696426</ref>

The AI Iamus (computer)|Iamus created 2012 the first complete classical album fully composed by a computer.

Other endeavours, like AIVA (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist), focus on composing symphonic music, mainly classical music for film scores.<ref name="LWO">cite news|url=http://www.wort.lu/de/kultur/aiva-une-jeune-start-up-qui-ne-manque-pas-d-ambitions-la-musique-classique-recomposee-57fbba6b5061e01abe83a1c2|title=La musique classique recomposée|last=Hick|first=Thierry|publisher=Luxemburger Wort|publication-date=11 October 2016</ref> It achieved a world first by becoming the first virtual composer to be recognized by a musical Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|professional association.<ref>SACEM Database, https://repertoire.sacem.fr/resultats?filters=parties&query=aiva&nbWorks=20)</ref>

Artificial intelligences can even produce music usable in a medical setting, with Melomics’s effort to use computer-generated music for stress and pain relief.<ref name="alergy">cite journal |doi=10.1111/pai.12263 |pmid=25115240 |title=Melomics music medicine (M3) to lessen pain perception during pediatric prick test procedure |journal=Pediatric Allergy and Immunology |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=721–724 |year=2014 |last1=Requena |first1=Gloria |last2=Sánchez |first2=Carlos |last3=Corzo-Higueras |first3=José Luis |last4=Reyes-Alvarado |first4=Sirenia |last5=Rivas-Ruiz |first5=Francisco |last6=Vico |first6=Francisco |last7=Raglio |first7=Alfredo </ref>

Moreover, initiatives such as Google Magenta, conducted by the Google Brain team, want to find out if an artificial intelligence can be capable of creating compelling art.<ref name="ENG">cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/05/23/google-magenta-machine-learning-music-art/|title=Google's 'Magenta' project will see if AIs can truly make art|last=Souppouris|first=Aaron|publisher=Engadget|publication-date=23 May 2016</ref>

At Sony CSL Research Laboratory, their Flow Machines software has created pop songs by learning music styles from a huge database of songs. By analyzing unique combinations of styles and optimizing techniques, it can compose in any style.

Another artificial intelligence musical composition project, The Watson Beat, written by IBM Research, doesn't need a huge database of music like the Google Magenta and Flow Machines projects, since it uses Reinforcement Learning and Deep Belief Networks to compose music on a simple seed input melody and a select style.  Since the software has been open sourced<ref name="twb">cite web |url=https://github.com/cognitive-catalyst/watson-beat |title= Watson Beat on GitHub|date= 2018-10-10</ref> musicians, such as Taryn Southern<ref name=taryn>cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/music-written-by-artificial-intelligence/|title=Songs in the Key of AI|publisher=Wired|publication-date=17 May 2018</ref> have been collaborating with the project to create music.

Beyond automation of writing tasks given data input, AI has shown significant potential for computers to engage in higher-level creative work. AI Storytelling has been an active field of research since James Meehan's development of TALESPIN, which made up stories similar to the fables of Aesop. The program would start with a set of characters who wanted to achieve certain goals, with the story as a narration of the characters’ attempts at executing plans to satisfy these goals.<ref>James R. Meehan. Tale-spin, an interactive program that writes stories. In ''Proceedings  of  the  5th  International  Joint  Conference  on  Artificial  Intelligence  -  Volume  1, IJCAI’77'', pages 91–98, San Francisco, CA, USA, 1977.Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.</ref> Since Meehan, other researchers have worked on AI Storytelling using similar or different approaches. Mark Riedl and Vadim Bulitko argued that the essence of storytelling was an experience management problem, or "how to balance the need for a coherent story progression with user agency, which are often at odds."<ref>“Interactive Narrative: An Intelligent Systems Approach” by Mark Owen Riedl, Vadim Bulitko in ''AI Magazine, Vol. 34'', No. 1, 2013 <nowiki>https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2449</nowiki></ref> 

While most research on AI storytelling has focused on story generation (e.g. character and plot), there has also been significant investigation in story communication. In 2002, researchers at North Carolina State University developed an architectural framework for narrative prose generation. Their particular implementation was able faithfully reproduced text variety and complexity of a number of stories, such as red riding hood, with human-like adroitness.<ref>Callaway, Charles B., & James C. Lester (2002). “Narrative prose generation.” ''Artificial Intelligence 139.2'': 213–52. <nowiki>http://www.intellimedia.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/npg-ijcai01.pdf</nowiki></ref> This particular field continues to gain interest.

 Telecommunications maintenance 
Many telecommunications companies make use of
Search algorithm|heuristic search in the management of their workforces, for example BT Group has deployed heuristic search<ref name="TheorSoc">[http://www.theorsociety.com/Science_of_Better/htdocs/prospect/can_do/success_stories/dwsbt.htm Success Stories] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004194517/http://www.theorsociety.com/Science_of_Better/htdocs/prospect/can_do/success_stories/dwsbt.htm|date=October 4, 2011.</ref> in a scheduling application that provides the work schedules of 20,000 engineers.

 Toys and games 
The 1990s saw some of the first attempts to mass-produce domestically aimed types of basic Artificial Intelligence for education, or leisure. This prospered greatly with the Digital Revolution, and helped introduce people, especially children, to a life of dealing with various types of Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the form of Tamagotchis and Giga Pets, iPod Touch, the Internet, and the first widely released robot, Furby. A mere year later an improved type of domestic robot was released in the form of Aibo, a robotic dog with intelligent features and autonomy.

Companies like Mattel have been creating an assortment of AI-enabled toys for kids as young as age three. Using proprietary AI engines and speech recognition tools, they are able to understand conversations, give intelligent responses and learn quickly.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/10/15/how-artificial-intelligence-is-moving-from-the-lab-to-your-kids-playroom/|title=How artificial intelligence is moving from the lab to your kid's playroom|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-18</ref>

AI has also been Game artificial intelligence|applied to video games, for example video game bots, which are designed to stand in as opponents where humans aren't available or desired.

 Transportation 
Fuzzy logic controllers have been developed for automatic gearboxes in automobiles. For example, the 2006 Audi TT, Volkswagen Touareg|VW Touareg Citation needed|date=February 2011 and Volkswagen Transporter (T5)|VW Caravell feature the DSP transmission which utilizes Fuzzy Logic. A number of Škoda variants (Škoda Fabia) also currently include a Fuzzy Logic-based controller.

Today's cars now have AI-based driver assist features such as self-parking and advanced cruise controls.  AI has been used to optimize traffic management applications, which in turn reduces wait times, energy use, and emissions by as much as 25 percent.<ref name=":03" />  In the future, fully autonomous cars will be developed.  AI in transportation is expected to provide safe, efficient, and reliable transportation while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities. The major challenge to developing this AI is the fact that transportation systems are inherently complex systems involving a very large number of components and different parties, each having different and often conflicting objectives.<ref>Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Michael D.|year=January 2007|title=Artificial Intelligence in Transportation Information for Application|url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/circulars/ec113.pdf|journal=Transportation Research Circular|volume=|pages=|via=</ref>. Due to this high degree of complexity of the transportation, and in particular the automotive, application, it is in most cases not possible to train an AI algorithm in a real-world driving environment. To overcome the challenge of training neural networks for automated driving, methodologies based on virtual development resp. testing toolchains<ref>cite journal|last1=Hallerbach|first1=Sven|last2=Xia|first2=Yiqun|last3=Eberle|first3=Ulrich|last4=Koester|first4=Frank|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324194968_Simulation-based_Identification_of_Critical_Scenarios_for_Cooperative_and_Automated_Vehicles|title=Simulation-based Identification of Critical Scenarios for Cooperative and Automated Vehicles|date=3 April 2018|work=SAE Technical Paper 2018-01-1066|access-date=23 December 2018</ref> have been proposed.
