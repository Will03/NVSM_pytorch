Browman |publisher=Haskins Laboratories |accessdate=2013-07-30</ref> of Haskins Laboratories and Louis M. Goldstein<ref>cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/linguist/faculty/louis.html |title=Linguistics |publisher=Yale University |accessdate=2013-07-30</ref> of Yale University and Haskins. The theory identifies theoretical discrepancies between phonetics and phonology and aims to unify the two by treating them as low- and high-dimensional descriptions of a single system.

Unification can be achieved by incorporating into a single model the idea that the physical system (identified with phonetics) constrains the underlying abstract system (identified with phonology), making the units of control at the abstract planning level the same as those at the physical level.

The plan of an utterance is formatted as a gestural score, which provides the input to a physically based model of speech production - the task dynamic model of Elliot Saltzman.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/sargent/about/faculty/physical-therapy/saltzman/ |accessdate=December 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220181630/http://www.bu.edu/sargent/about/faculty/physical-therapy/saltzman/ |archivedate=December 20, 2006 </ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/saltzman.html |title=Elliot Saltzman |publisher=Haskins Laboratories |accessdate=2013-07-30</ref> The gestural score graphs locations within the vocal tract where constriction can occur, indicating the planned or target degree of constriction. A computational model of speech production developed at Haskins Laboratories combines articulatory phonology, task dynamics, and the Haskins articulatory synthesis system developed by Philip Rubin and colleagues.
