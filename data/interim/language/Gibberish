The word ''gibberish'' is more commonly applied to informal speech, while ''gobbledygook'' (sometimes ''gobbledegook'', ''gobbledigook'' or ''gobbledegoo'') is more often applied to writing or language that is meaningless or is made unintelligible by excessive use of abstruse technical terms.citation needed|date=February 2014  "Officialese", "legalese", or "bureaucratese" are forms of gobbledygook. The related word ''jibber-jabber'' refers to rapid talk that is difficult to understand.<ref>cite book|last1=Stevenson|first1=Angus|last2=Lindberg|first2=Christine A.|title=jibber-jabber |encyclopedia=New Oxford American Dictionary|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|isbn=978-0-19-539288-3</ref>

Etymology
The term ''gibberish'' was first seen in English in the early 16th&nbsp;century.<ref>cite book |last=Chantrell |first=Glynnis |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |location=Oxford, UK |pages=231 |isbn=0-19-863121-9</ref> Its etymology is not certain, but it is generally thought to be an onomatopoeia imitative of speech, similar to the words ''jabber'' (to talk rapidly) and ''gibber'' (to speak inarticulately).<ref>cite encyclopedia |year=2013 |title=gibberish |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press</ref><ref>Cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gibberish |accessdate=6 February 2014</ref>

It may originate from the word ''jib'', which is the Angloromani variant of the Romani language word meaning "language" or "tongue". To non-speakers, the Anglo-Romany dialect could sound like English mixed with nonsense words, and if those seemingly-nonsensical words are referred to as "jib" then the term "gibberish" (pronounced "jibberish") could be derived as a descriptor for nonsensical speech. Another theory is that gibberish came from the name of a famous 8th&nbsp;century arab|Arabian alchemist, Jābir ibn Hayyān, whose name was List of Latinised names|Latinized as "Geber." Thus, "gibberish" was a reference to the incomprehensible technical jargon and allegorical coded language used by Jabir and other Alchemy|alchemists.<ref>cite journal |first=Glenn T. |last=Seaborg |title=Our heritage of the elements |journal=Metallurgical and Materials Transactions B |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media |Springer Boston |volume=11 |issue=1 |date=March 1980 |pages=5–19 |doi=10.1007/bf02657166</ref><ref name="WonderfulWord">cite book |url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/its-a-wonderful-word-the-real-origins-of-our-favourite-words/9781446456095 |title=It's a Wonderful Word: The Real Origins of Our Favourite Words |publisher=Random House UK |author=Jack, Albert |year=2011 |location=London, UK |isbn=978-1847946690</ref><ref>cite web |last1=Quinion |first1=Michael |title=Gibberish|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-gib2.htm |website=World Wide Words |accessdate=20 January 2016 |date=3 Oct 2015</ref>
