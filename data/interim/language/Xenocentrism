 Origin of the term 
Xenocentrism was coined by American sociologists Donald P. Kent and Robert G. Burnight in the 1952 paper "Group Centrism in Complex Societies" published in the ''American Journal of Sociology''.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name=merton>cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPvcHuUMEMwC&pg=PA108&dq=Xenocentrism |title=The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations |publisher=University of Chicago Press |author=Robert K. Merton |year= 1973|page=108 |accessdate=December 28, 2014|isbn=9780226520926 </ref> Kent and Burnight state that feelings of xenocentrism are caused by three possible factors; individuals who have familial ties to a foreign country, specifically 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants, those who oppose the political choices of their native country, an example of this being the Communist Party USA which idealized the Soviet Union and its anti-capitalist government, and individuals who are exposed to other cultures and grow disenchanted with and rebel against their own society.<ref name=":1" /> The term remained obscure but considered useful and occasionally used by other sociologists.<ref name=merton/>  The University of Florida treats it as a key term of Sociology.<ref>cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00014168/00001|title=Introduction to Sociology|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015</ref>

The term is opposed to ethnocentrism, as coined by 19th-century American sociologist William Graham Sumner, which describes the natural tendencies of an individual to place disproportionate worth upon the values and beliefs of one's own culture relative to others.<ref name="Kent">Kent, Donald P. and Burnight, Robert G.

Consumer xenocentrism
Rene Dentiste Mueller and Amanda Broderick<ref>cite web|last1=Mueller|first1=Rene Dentiste|last2=Broderick|first2=Amanda J|title=Consumer Xenocentrism An Alternative Theory of Foreign Product Bias|publisher=SCRIBD|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/176866526/501-Mueller-R-Broderick-AConsumer-Xenocentrism-An-Alternative-Explanation-for-Foreign-Product-Bias</ref> were the first to apply the consumer xenocentrism (CX) concept to describe the preference some consumers have for foreign goods even when domestic goods are qualitatively and/or functionally similar or better.  Although the CX phenomenon is global, the researchers cite a significant number of studies that suggests there are proportionally more consumer xenocentrics in former colonies where the locals have been conditioned to perceive ‘foreign’ as better.  A consequence of consumer xenocentrism is its negative effect on local industry and on the decline in living standards as poor consumers buy the (often) more expensive foreign products. Consumer xenocentrism, especially among the local elites, reduces confidence and pride in local manufacturing which can lead to the loss of local industries, a decline in purchase choices, especially among traditional products or even a dependency on foreign ones.   Mueller, Wang, Liu and Cui,<ref>cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=Rene Dentiste|last2=Wan|first2=George Xun|last3=Liu|first3=Gouli|last4=Cui|first4=Charles Cui|title=Consumer Xenocentrism in China: An Exploratory Study|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics|date=2016|volume=28|issue=1|pages=73–91|doi=10.1108/apjml-11-2014-0158</ref> applied the concept to China and showed consumer xenocentrism is not a new phenomenon.  The researchers were also able to show that when consumer xenocentrism grew too much,  a ‘protection of the herd’ mentality caused the pendulum to swing  back towards consumer ethnocentrism (nationalism).

In his doctoral dissertation, Steven James Lawrence suggests xenocentrism may be an influential in making consumers buying decisions as they might have "favorable orientations to products from outside their membership group.<ref name=":0">cite journal|url=http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/oa_dissertations/606/|title="Consumer Xenocentrism And Consumer Cosmopolitanism: The De-Velopment A" by Steven James Lawrence|journal=Wayne State University Dissertations|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=January 2012|last1=Lawrence|first1=Steven</ref>

=Measurement of consumer xenocentrism=

Lawrence uses the definition of xenocentrism, conceived by Kent and Burnight, to describe propose a potential scale, CXENO, to predict how xenocentric views of non-domestic goods affects consumer behavior.<ref name=":0" /> The most recently proposed scale to quantity xenocentric consumer tendencies, XSCALE, includes both instances of social and consumer xenocentrism.<ref>cite book|last1=Rojas-Méndez|first1=José I.|last2=Chapa|first2=Sindy|title=Rescuing Xenocentrism: The Missing Construct in Consumer Behavior—An Abstract|journal=Creating Marketing Magic and Innovative Future Marketing Trends|date=1 January 2017|pages=1089|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-45596-9_200|publisher=Springer, Cham|language=en|series=Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science|isbn=978-3-319-45595-2</ref>

Economists have begun to include consumer xenocentrism, along with other consumer centrisms such as consumer ethnocentrism and consumer cosmopolitanism, in their analysis of consumer behavior.<ref name=":2">cite journal|last2=Davies|first2=Mark A.P.|last3=Cleveland|first3=Mark|last4=Palihawadana|first4=Dayananda|title=Here, there and everywhere: a study of consumer centrism|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=33|issue=5|pages=715–754|doi=10.1108/imr-06-2014-0205|last1=Prince|first1=Melvin|year=2016|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/102143/14/Here%20There%20and%20Everywhere%2010-14.pdf</ref> Most recent research has looked at how these three centrisms impact one another.<ref name=":2" />
