File:Kariktura.JPG|thumb|KLEPTOROUMANIA<br>''Punch (magazine)|Punch'' cartoon of the Second Balkan War. King Carol I of Romania points his pistol at King Peter I of Serbia and King Constantine I of Greece|Constantine of Greece while he steals Southern Dobrudja from the disarmed Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria. The title "KLEPTOROUMANIA" is a pun on kleptomania, the mental disorder of impulsive stealing for the sake of stealing.

The pun, also called paronomasia, is a form of word play that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect. These ambiguities can arise from the intentional use of Homophone|homophonic, homographic, metonymic, or figurative language. A pun differs from a malapropism in that a malapropism is an incorrect variation on a correct expression, while a pun involves expressions with multiple correct interpretations. Puns may be regarded as in-jokes or idiomatic constructions, as their usage and meaning are specific to a particular language and its culture.

Puns have a long history in human writing. For example, the Roman playwright Plautus was famous for his puns and word games.<ref name="Pollack2011">cite book|author=John Pollack|title=The Pun Also Rises|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XwMoG3zlYVwC|date=14 April 2011|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-51386-6</ref><ref>M. Fontaine, Funny Words in Plautine Comedy, Oxford, 2010.</ref>

 Typology 
Puns can be classified in various ways.

=Homophonic=
The homophonic pun, a common type, uses word pairs which sound alike (homophones) but are not synonymous.<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/how-very-pun-ny-of-you/|title=English Grammar Lesson - How very pun-ny of you! - ELC|date=2016-08-02|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en-US</ref> Walter Redfern summarized this type with his statement, "To pun is to treat homonyms as synonyms."<ref>''Puns'', Blackwell, London, 1984</ref> For example, in George Carlin's phrase "atheism is a non-prophet institution", the word ''prophet'' is put in place of its homophone ''wikt:profit|profit'', altering the common phrase "non-profit organization|non-profit institution". Similarly, the joke "Question: Why do we still United States Army Europe#Cold War|have troops in Germany? Answer: To keep the Warsaw Pact|Russians in Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czech" relies on the aural ambiguity of the homophones ''wikt:check|check'' and ''wikt:Czech|Czech''. Often, puns are not strictly homophonic, but play on words of similar, not identical, sound as in the example from the ''Pinky and the Brain'' cartoon film series: "I think so, Brain, but if we give peas a chance, won't the lima beans feel left out?" which plays with the similar—but not identical—sound of ''peas'' and ''peace'' in the anti-war slogan "Give Peace a Chance".<ref>q:Pinky and the Brain|''See the citation on Wikiquote''</ref>

=Homographic=
A ''homographic'' pun exploits words which are spelled the same (homographs) but possess different meanings and sounds. Because of their nature, they rely on sight more than hearing, contrary to homophonic puns. They are also known as ''heteronymic puns''. Examples in which the punned words typically exist in two different parts of speech often rely on unusual sentence construction, as in the anecdote: "When asked to explain his large number of children, the pig answered simply: 'The wild oats of my sow gave us many piglets.'" An example that combines homophonic and homographic punning is Douglas Adams's line "You can tune a guitar, but you can't tuna fish. Unless of course, you play bass (fish)|bass." The phrase uses the homophonic qualities of ''tune a'' and ''tuna'', as well as the homographic pun on ''bass'', in which ambiguity is reached through the identical spellings of IPAc-en|b|eɪ|s (a Bass guitar|string instrument), and IPAc-en|b|æ|s (a Bass (fish)|kind of fish). Homographic puns do not necessarily need to follow grammatical rules and often do not make sense when interpreted outside the context of the pun, for example "You can't tuna fish" makes neither grammatical nor logical sense yet when it is inside the context of the pun it gains meaning and humour.

''Homonymic'' puns, another common type, arise from the exploitation of words which are both homographs and homophones. The statement "Being in politics is just like playing golf: you are trapped in one bad lie after another" puns on the two meanings of the word ''lie'' as "a deliberate untruth" and as "the position in which something rests". An adaptation of a joke repeated by Isaac Asimov gives us "Did you hear about the little moron who strained himself while running into the screen door?" playing on ''strained'' as "to give much effort" and "to filter".<ref>Asimov, Isaac. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nFdOG5JxWZoC&pg=PA174&dq=asimov+puns&hl=en&ei=XnnRS7vkH4zasgOn3IXhCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=little%20moron&f=false ''Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor''], p. 175, § 252. 1971. Houghton Mifflin. New York.</ref> A homonymic pun may also be polysemic, in which the words must be homonymic and also possess related meanings, a condition that is often subjective. However, lexicographers define polysemes as listed under a single dictionary Lemma (morphology)|lemma (a unique numbered meaning) while homonyms are treated in separate lemmata.

=Compounded=
A compound pun is a statement that contains two or more puns. In this case, the wordplay cannot go into effect by utilizing the separate words or phrases of the puns that make up the entire statement. For example, a complex statement by Richard Whately includes four puns: "Why can a man never starve in the Sahara|Great Desert? Because he can eat the sand which is there. But what brought the sandwiches there? Why, Noah sent Ham, and his descendants mustered and bred."<ref>cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/28/opinion/28Tartakovsky.html | work=The New York Times | title=Pun for the Ages | first=Joseph | last=Tartakovsky | date=28 March 2009</ref> This pun uses ''sand which is there/sandwiches there'', ''Ham (son of Noah)|Ham/ham'', ''mustered/mustard'', and ''bred/bread''. Similarly, the phrase "piano is not my forte" links two meanings of the words ''forte'' and ''piano'', one for the dynamic markings in music and the second for the literal meaning of the sentence, as well as alluding to "pianoforte", the older name of the instrument. Compound puns may also combine two phrases that share a word. For example, "Where do mathematicians go on weekends? To a Möbius strip club!" puns on the terms ''Möbius strip'' and ''strip club''.

=Recursive=
A recursive pun is one in which the second aspect of a pun relies on the understanding of an element in the first. For example, the statement "π is only half a pie." (π radians is 180 degree (angle)|degrees, or half a circle, and a pie is a complete circle). Another example is "Infinity is not in finity", which means infinity is not in Finite set|finite range. Another example is "a Freudian slip is when you say one thing but mean Oedipus complex|your mother."<ref>cite web|url=http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/lit_terms/puns.html |title=PUNS |publisher=Tnellen.com |accessdate=20 December 2011</ref> The recursive pun "Immanuel doesn't pun, he Immanuel Kant|Kant," is attributed to Oscar Wilde.<ref>cite book|last1=Pollack|first1=John|title=The Pun Also Rises: How the Humble Pun Revolutionized Language, Changed History, and Made Wordplay More Than Some Antics|date=2012|publisher=Avery|isbn=978-1592406753|page=xxiii|edition=Reprint</ref>

=Visual=
File:148FS USAF emblem.png|thumb|148th Fighter Squadron emblem, a visual pun.
Visual puns are sometimes used in logos, emblems, insignia, and other graphic symbols, in which one or more of the pun aspects is replaced by a picture. In European heraldry, this technique is called canting arms. Visual and other puns and word games are also common in Dutch gable stones as well as in some cartoons, such as ''Lost Consonants'' and ''The Far Side''. Another type of visual pun exists in languages which use non-phonetic writing. For example, in Chinese, a pun may be based on a similarity in shape of the written character, despite a complete lack of phonetic similarity in the words punned upon.<ref>Attardo, Salvatore. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hE_ex4MZKIEC&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=%22Chinese+puns%22&source=bl&ots=m1U5cflqqQ&sig=Rw0Fo4i6ecjW4VlFgSl4gym8pqk&hl=en&ei=or71SoTGOIvQ8QapyfDzCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CB8Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=%22Chinese%20puns%22&f=false ''Linguistic Theories of Humor''], p.109.

=Comedy and jokes=
Puns are a common source of humour in jokes and Stand-up comedy|comedy shows. They are often used in the punch line of a joke, where they typically give a humorous meaning to a rather perplexing story. These are also known as feghoots. The following example comes from the movie ''Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World'', though the punchline stems from far older Vaudeville roots.<ref>cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=BoT1Cc1Ecb8C&lpg=PA20&dq=lesser%20of%20two%20weevils%20joke&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q= | title=Vaudeville Humor: The Collected Jokes, Routines, and Skits of Ed Lowry | author=Levitt, Paul M. | year=2002 | publisher=Southern Illinois University Press | isbn=978-0-8093-2720-1</ref> The final line puns on the stock phrase "lesser of two evils principle|the lesser of two evils".
::Captain Aubrey, played by Russell Crowe: "Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?...Which would you choose?"
::Dr. Maturin: "Neither. There's not a scrap of difference between them. They're the same species of ''Curculio''."
::Captain Aubrey: "If you had to choose. If you were forced to make a choice. If there were no other option."
::Dr. Maturin: "Well, then, if you're going to push me. I would choose the right-hand weevil. It has significant advantage in both length and breadth."
::Captain Aubrey: "There, I have you!...Do you not know that in Royal Navy|the Service, one must always choose ''the lesser of two weevils''?"

In a similar vein, there was the artist, shopping for supplies, who purchased the lesser of the two easels.

Puns often are used in the titles of comedic Parody|parodies. A parody of a popular song, movie, etc., may be given a title that hints at the title of the work being parodied, substituting some of the words with ones that sound or look similar. For example, collegiate a cappella groups are often named after musical puns to attract fans through attempts at humor. Such a title can immediately communicate both that what follows is a parody and also which work is about to be parodied, making any further "setup" (introductory explanation) unnecessary.

Here is an example from Shakespeare's ''Richard III (play)|Richard III'':
::"Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this ''son'' of York" (''Son''/''sun'')

Shakespeare was also noted for his frequent play with less serious puns, the "quibbles" of the sort that made Samuel Johnson complain, "A quibble is to Shakespeare what luminous vapours are to the traveller! He follows it to all adventures; it is sure to lead him out of his way, sure to engulf him in the mire. It has some malignant power over his mind, and its fascinations are irresistible."<ref>Samuel Johnson, ''Preface to Shakespeare''.</ref> Elsewhere, Johnson disparagingly referred to punning as the lowest form of humour.<ref>cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mf-miymm-i8C | title=You Can Say That Again! | publisher=Dundurn | author=Rogers, Bruce | year=1999 | pages=95</ref>

In the poem ''A Hymn to God the Father'', John Donne, married to Anne More, reportedly puns repeatedly: "Son/sun" in the second quoted line, and two compound puns on "Donne/done" and "More/more". All three are homophonic, with the puns on "more" being both homographic and capitonymic. The ambiguities serve to introduce several possible meanings into the verses.

::"When Thou hast ''done'', Thou hast not ''done'' / For I have ''more''.
::that at my death Thy ''Son'' / Shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore
::And having ''done'' that, Thou hast ''done''; / I fear no ''more''."

Alfred Hitchcock stated, "Puns are the highest form of literature."<ref>cite AV media | title = The Dick Cavett Show | medium = Television production | time = 8 June 1972 | publisher = American Broadcasting Company | location = United States </ref>

=Rhetoric=

Puns can function as a rhetorical device, where the pun serves as a persuasive instrument for an author or speaker. Although puns are sometimes perceived as trite or silly, if used responsibly a pun "…can be an effective communication tool in a variety of situations and forms".<ref>cite journal|last=Junker|first=Dave|title=In Defense of Puns: How to Use them Effectively|journal=Public Relations Tactics|date=Feb 2013|volume=20|issue=2|page=18</ref> A major difficulty in using puns in this manner is that the meaning of a pun can be interpreted very differently according to the audience’s background and can significantly subtract from a message.<ref>cite journal|last=Djafarova|first=Elmira|title=Why Do Advertisers Use Puns?

In the media

Paronomasia has found a strong foothold in the media. William Safire of the ''New York Times'' suggests that "the root of this pace-growing [use of paranomasia] is often a headline-writer’s need for quick catchiness, and has resulted in a new tolerance for a long-despised form of humor."<ref>Safire, W. "On Language: A Barrel of Puns." ''New York Times'' (1923-Current file): SM2. 1980.</ref> It can be argued that paronomasia is common in the media, especially headlines, to draw the reader’s interest. The rhetoric is important because it connects people with the topic. A notable example is the New York Post headline "Headless Body in Topless Bar." <ref>cite web|last1=Vincent|first1=Musetto|title=Vincent Musetto, 74, dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/business/media/vincent-musetto-74-author-of-headless-headline-of-ageless-fame.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=27 August 2015</ref>

Paronomasia is prevalent orally as well. Salvatore Attardo believes that puns are verbal humor. He talks about Pepicello and Weisberg's linguistic theory of humor and believes the only form of linguistic humor is limited to puns.<ref>Attardo S. "Puns, Relevance and Appreciation in Advertisements." ''Journal of Pragmatics'' 37.5 (2005): 707-21.</ref> This is because a pun is a play on the word itself. Attardo believes that only puns are able to maintain humor and this humor has significance. It is able to help soften a situation and make it less serious, it can help make something more memorable, and using a pun can make the speaker seem witty.

Paronomasia is strong in print media and oral conversation so it can be assumed that paronomasia is strong in broadcast media as well. Examples of paranomasia in media are sound bites. They could be memorable because of the humor and rhetoric associated with paronomasia, thus making the significance of the sound bite stronger.

Confusion and alternative uses

There exist subtle differences between paronomasia and other literary techniques, such as the double entendre. While puns are often simple wordplay for comedic or rhetorical effect, a double entendre alludes to a second meaning which is not contained within the statement or phrase itself, often one which purposefully disguises the second meaning. As both exploit the use of intentional double meanings, puns can sometimes be double entendres, and vice versa. Puns also bear similarities with paraprosdokian, Zuegma#Syllepsis|syllepsis, and eggcorns. In addition, homographic puns are sometimes compared to the stylistic device antanaclasis, and homophonic puns to polyptoton.
Puns can be used as a type of mnemonic device to enhance comprehension in an educational setting. Used discreetly, puns can effectively reinforce content and aid in the retention of material. Some linguists have encouraged the creation of neologisms to decrease the instances of confusion caused by puns.<ref>Shakespeare Survey - Volume 23 - Page 19, Kenneth Muir - 2002</ref>
