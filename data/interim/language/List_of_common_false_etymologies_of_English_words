Ethnic slurs
*Cracker (pejorative)|Cracker: The use of "cracker" as a pejorative term for a white person does not come from the use of bullwhips by whites against slaves in the Atlantic slave trade.  The term comes from the labor of cracking corn (as referred to in the song Jimmy Crack Corn) and was used as a pejorative term for a southern sharecropper who grew and milled corn for a living.  The cracked corn – or nib – was the hard bit of the kernel discarded from milled corn.  The nib was considered undesirable and the sharecropper would take this as his share and feed his family.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cracker|title=Cracker (2)|year=2010|publisher=|author=Douglas Harper|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=June 17, 2011</ref>
*Gringo: The word "gringo" (a pejorative term for a white American) did not originate during the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), the Venezuelan War of Independence (1811–1823), the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), or in the American Old West (circa 1865–1899) as a corruption of the lyrics "green grow" in either "Green Grow the Lilacs" or "Green Grow the Rushes, O" sung by United States Army|American soldiers or cowboys; nor did it originate during any of these times as a corruption of "Green go home!", falsely said to have been shouted at green-clad American troops, or of "green coats" as a description of their uniforms. The word originally simply meant "foreigner" and is probably a corruption of Spanish ''griego'', "Greek".<ref>cite encyclopedia

*Niggardly: The word "niggardly", meaning stingy or miserly, is not actually related to the racial slur "nigger", despite the similar sound.

*Spic: The word "spic" (a pejorative term for a Latino) did not originate as an abbreviation of "Hispanic"; nor as an acronym for "Hispanic and Latino Americans|Spanish, Native Americans in the United States|Indian, and African American|Colored" (in reference to minority races in the United States); nor as an acronym for "Spanish, Polish, Italian, and Chinese", falsely said to have been used by United States Immigration and Naturalization Service|U.S. immigration officials in the 1940s, 1950s, or 1960s to categorize citizenship applications. The word, originally spelled "spig", was short for "spiggoty", which is probably from the Spanglish phrase "No speak the English".<ref>cite encyclopedia

Acronyms
The use of acronyms to create new words was nearly non-existent in English until the middle of the 20th century. Nearly all older words were formed in other ways.<ref>Keith M. Denning ''et al.'', ''English Vocabulary Elements'', 2007 isbn|0198037538, p. 60</ref>
*Coma: Some falsely believe that the word coma originates from "cessation of motor activity". Although this describes the condition of coma, this is not the true derivation.

*News: The word news has been claimed to be an acronym of the four cardinal directions (north, east, west, and south). However, old spellings of the word varied widely (e.g., newesse, newis, nevis, neus, newys, niewes, newis, nues, etc.). Additionally, an identical term exists in French, "les nouvelles", which translates as the plural of "the new". The word "news" is simply a plural form of ''new''.
* Pom or pommy is an Australian English, New Zealand English, and South African English term for a person of British descent or origin. The exact origins of the term remain obscure (Alternative words for British#Pommy|see here for further information). A legend persists that the term arises from the acronym P.O.M.E., for "prisoner of Mother England" (or P.O.H.M, "prisoners of His/Her Majesty"), although there is no evidence to support this assertion.
* Posh was not an acronym for wealthy British passengers getting "port out, starboard home" cabins on ocean liners to India, in order to get ocean breeze. The actual origins of the word are unknown.
* ''Shit:'' see under "Obscenities"

*Whole nine yards|Whole Nine Yards: The actual origin of the phrase "the whole nine yards" is a mystery, and nearly all claimed explanations are easily proven false. Incorrect explanations include the length of machine gun belts, the capacity of concrete mixers (in cubic yards), various types of fabric, and many other explanations. All are probably false, since most rely on nine yards when evidence suggests that the phrase began as "the whole six yards". In addition, the phrase has appeared in print as early as 1907, while many explanations require a much later origin date.

*Faggot (slang)|Faggot: The slur usage of the word "faggot" (originally referring to a bundle of firewood) is sometimes falsely claimed to come from a practice of throwing homosexuals into a fire to be burned to death, as they were not important enough to be burned at the stake.  One possible origin is in the use of "faggot" as a pejorative term for women in a similar way to "baggage", i.e. something heavy to be dealt with.citation needed|date=June 2018  The usage may also have been influenced by the British term "Fagging|fag", meaning a younger schoolboy who acts as an older schoolboy's servant.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/faggot|title=faggot - Origin and meaning of faggot by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com</ref>

* Hiccough, an alternate spelling still encountered for hiccup, originates in an assumption that the second syllable was originally ''cough''. The word is in fact onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic in origin.
*Idiot does come from the ancient Greek word ''ἰδιώτης'' (idiōtēs, "a private person, individual"), but it was not derogatory in Greek, and did not express the notion that it was foolish ("idiotic") not to participate in civic life. Indeed, a citizen (''πολίτης'') was an ''ἰδιώτης'' when acting in a private rather than an official capacity, even in deliberations of the Assembly. The meaning "foolish" or "stupid" came much later.<ref>A.W. Sparkes, "Idiots, Ancient and Modern", ''Australian Journal of Political Science'' 23:1:101-102 (1988) doi|10.1080/00323268808402051</ref>
* "Innocence|Innocent": often wrongly believed to have the original meaning of "not knowing", as if it came from Latin ''noscere'' (to know); in fact it comes from ''nocere'' (to harm), so the primary sense is "harmless".
* Isle and Island: The word "isle" is not short for "island", nor is the word "island" an extension of "isle"; the words are unrelated.<ref>cite encyclopedia|year=2011|title=Island|encyclopedia=Merriam–Webster|publisher=Merriam–Webster, Inc|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/island|accessdate=June 17, 2011</ref><ref>cite encyclopedia|year=2001 |title=Island |encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/island |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701015638/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/island |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 17, 2011 |df= </ref> "Isle" comes ultimately from Latin ''īnsula'', meaning "island"; "island" comes ultimately from Old English ''īegland'', also meaning "island", or technically "island land" (cf. Icelandic ''ey'' "island").  The spelling ''island'' with an S, however, is indeed due to the influence of ''isle''.
* "Marmalade": there is an apocryphal story that Mary, Queen of Scots, ate it when she had a headache, and that the name is derived from her maids' whisper of "Marie est malade" (Mary is ill). In fact it is derived from Portuguese ''marmelo'', meaning quince, and then expanded from quince jam to other fruit preserves.  It is found in English-language sources written before Mary was even born.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-mar3.htm|title=World Wide Words: Marmalade|website=World Wide Words|language=en-gb|access-date=2016-07-13</ref>
* Nasty: The term ''nasty'' was not derived from the surname of Thomas Nast as a reference to his biting, vitriolic cartoons.

That work was published in 1651, whereas Nast was born in 1840.

* "Woman" does not originate from "woven from man", nor from "womb". It came from the Old English ''wifmann'' ("woman person"), a compound of ''wif'' ("woman" – cf. "wife") + ''man'' ("human being"). ''Mann'', the word for "person", eventually came to be used for males specifically.
* "Welsh rarebit" has been claimed to be the original spelling of the savoury dish "Welsh rabbit". Both forms now have currency, though the form with "rabbit" is in fact the original.  Furthermore, the word "Welsh" in this context was used in a pejorative sense, meaning "foreign" or "substandard", and does not indicate that the dish originated in Wales.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>
