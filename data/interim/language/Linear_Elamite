Linear Elamite is an undeciphered Bronze Age writing system used in Elam, known from a few monumental inscriptions only. It was used contemporaneously with Elamite Cuneiform and possibly records the Elamite language.

Overview

It was in use for a brief period of time during the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC. It is often claimed that Linear Elamite is a syllabic writing system derived from the older Proto-Elamite writing system, although this has not been proven. Linear Elamite has not been deciphered.<ref>Francois Desset. Linear Elamite writing, in The Elamite world, eds. J. Alvarez-Mon, G.-P. Basello et Y.

Discovered texts

There are only 22 known documents in Linear Elamite; they are identified by letters A-V (Hinz, 1969, pp.&nbsp;11–44; Andre‚ and Salvini, 1989, pp.&nbsp;58–61); of these, 19 are on stone and clay objects excavated in the acropolis at Susa (now kept in the Louvre in Paris). Other objects are held at the National Museum of Iran.

The most important longer texts, partly bilingual inscription|bilingual, appear in monumental contexts. They are engraved on large stone sculptures, including a statue of the goddess Narunte (I), the "table au lion" (A), and large votive boulders (B, D), as well as on a series of steps (F, G, H, U) from a monumental stone stairway, where they alternated with steps bearing texts with  Akkadian titles of Puzur-Inšušinak. A unique find is item Q, a silver vase with a single line of perfectly executed text, kept in the Tehran Museum. There are also a few texts on baked-clay cones (J, K, L), a clay disk (M), and clay tablets (N, O, R). Some objects (A, I, C) include both Linear Elamite and Akkadian cuneiform inscriptions. The bilingual and bigraphic inscriptions of the monumental stairway as a whole, and the votive boulder B have inspired the first attempts at decipherment of Linear Elamite (Bork, 1905, 1924; Frank, 1912). Nine texts have also been found on silver beakers (X, Y, Z, F’, H’, I’, J’, K’ and L’). <ref>Francois Desset, Nine Linear Elamite Texts Inscribed on Silver “Gunagi” Vessels (X, Y, Z, F’, H’, I’, J’, K’ and L’): New Data on Linear Elamite Writing and the History of the Sukkalmaḫ Dynasty, Iran, Journal of the British Institute of Persian Studies, Volume 56, 2018 - Issue 2</ref> Note that some of the extant Linear Elamite inscriptions are suspected of being forgeries.

In 2016, 10 additional Linear Elamite inscriptions were discovered, some very long at nearly 200 signs.
