A vocabulary is a set of familiar words within a person's language. A vocabulary, usually developed with age, serves as a useful and fundamental tool for communication and learning|acquiring knowledge. Acquiring an extensive vocabulary is one of the largest challenges in learning a second language.

 Definition and usage 

Vocabulary is commonly defined as "all the words known and used by a particular person".<ref>[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=88554&dict=CALD Cambridge Advanced Learners Dictionary]</ref> ''Knowing'' a word, however, is not as simple as merely being able to recognize or use it. There are several aspects of word knowledge that are used to measure word knowledge.

= Productive and receptive knowledge =

The first major distinction that must be made when evaluating word knowledge is whether the knowledge is productive (also called achieve) or receptive (also called receive); even within those opposing categories, there is often no clear distinction. Words that are generally understood when heard or read or seen constitute a person's receptive vocabulary. These words may range from well-known to barely known (see Vocabulary#Degree of knowledge|degree of knowledge below). A person's receptive vocabulary is the larger of the two. For example, although a young child may not yet be able to speak, write, or sign, he or she may be able to follow simple commands and appear to understand a good portion of the language to which they are exposed. In this case, the child's receptive vocabulary is likely tens, if not hundreds of words, but his or her active vocabulary is zero. When that child learns to speak or sign, however, the child's active vocabulary begins to increase. It is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary, for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure, and can produce them, but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation.

Productive vocabulary, therefore, generally refers to words that can be produced within an appropriate context and match the intended meaning of the speaker or signer. As with receptive vocabulary, however, there are many degrees at which a particular word may be considered part of an active vocabulary. Knowing how to pronounce, sign, or write a word does not necessarily mean that the word that has been used correctly or accurately reflects the intended message; but it does reflect a minimal amount of productive knowledge.

= Degree of knowledge =
Within the receptive–productive distinction lies a range of abilities that are often referred to as ''degree of knowledge''. This simply indicates that a word gradually enters a person's vocabulary over a period of time as more aspects of word knowledge are learnt. Roughly, these stages could be described as:

# Never encountered the word.
# Heard the word, but cannot define it.
# Recognize the word due to context or tone of voice.
# Able to use the word and understand the general and/or intended meaning, but cannot clearly explain it.
# Fluent with the word – its use and definition.

= Depth of knowledge =

The differing degrees of word knowledge imply a greater ''depth of knowledge'', but the process is more complex than that. There are many facets to knowing a word, some of which are not hierarchical so their acquisition does not necessarily follow a linear progression suggested by ''degree of knowledge''. Several frameworks of word knowledge have been proposed to better operationalise this concept. One such framework includes nine facets:

# orthography – written form
# phonology – spoken form
# Referent|reference – meaning
# semantics – concept and reference
# Register (sociolinguistics)|register – appropriacy of use or cash register
# collocation – lexical neighbours
# word associations
# syntax – grammatical function
# morphology (linguistics)|morphology – word parts

= Definition of word =
Words can be defined in various ways, and estimates of vocabulary size differ depending on the definition used. The most common definition is that of a lemma (the uninflected or dictionary form; this includes ''walk'', but not ''walks, walked or walking''). Most of the time lemmas do not include proper nouns (names of people, places, companies, etc). Another definition often used in research of vocabulary size is that of word family. These are all the words that can be derived from a ground word (e.g., the words ''effortless, effortlessly, effortful, effortfully'' are all part of the word family ''effort''). Estimates of vocabulary size range from as high as 200 thousand to as low as 10 thousand, depending on the definition used. <ref>Brysbaert M, Stevens M, Mandera P and Keuleers E (2016) How Many Words Do We Know? Practical Estimates of Vocabulary Size Dependent on Word Definition, the Degree of Language Input and the Participant’s Age. Front.

= Reading vocabulary =

A literate person's vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when reading. This is generally the largest type of vocabulary simply because a reader tends to be exposed to more words by reading than by listening.

= Listening vocabulary =

A person's listening vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when listening to speech. People may still understand words they were not exposed to before using cues such as tone, gestures, the topic of discussion and the social context of the conversation.

= Speaking vocabulary =

A person's speaking vocabulary is all the words they use in speech. It is likely to be a subset of the listening vocabulary. Due to the spontaneous nature of speech, words are often misused. This misuse, though slight and unintentional, may be compensated by facial expressions and tone of voice.

= Writing vocabulary =

Words are used in various forms of writing from formal essays to social media feeds. Many written words do not commonly appear in speech. Writers generally use a limited set of words when communicating.citation needed|date=December 2017 For example, if there are a number of synonyms, a writer may have a preference as to which of them to use, and they are unlikely to use technical vocabulary relating to a subject in which they have no knowledge or interest.

 Focal vocabulary 

Focal vocabulary is a specialized set of terms and distinctions that is particularly important to a certain group: those with a particular focus of experience or activity. A lexicon, or vocabulary, is a language's dictionary: its set of names for things, events, and ideas. Some linguists believe that lexicon influences people's perception of things, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. For example, the Nuer people|Nuer of Sudan have an elaborate vocabulary to describe cattle. The Nuer have dozens of names for cattle because of the cattle's particular histories, economies, and environmentsClarify|date=March 2013. This kind of comparison has elicited some linguistic controversy, as with the number of "Eskimo words for snow". English speakers with relevant specialised knowledge can also display elaborate and precise vocabularies for snow and cattle when the need arises.<ref>Miller (1989)</ref><ref>Lenkeit</ref>

 Vocabulary growth 
main|Vocabulary development
During its infancy, a child instinctively builds a vocabulary. Infants imitate words that they hear and then associate those words with objects and actions. This is the Vocabulary#Listening vocabulary|listening vocabulary. The Vocabulary#Speaking vocabulary|speaking vocabulary follows, as a child's thoughts become more reliant on his/her ability to self-express without relying on gestures or babbling. Once the Vocabulary#Reading vocabulary|reading and Vocabulary#Writing vocabulary|writing vocabularies start to develop, through questions and education, the child starts to discover the anomalies and irregularities of language.

In first grade, a child who can read learns about twice as many words as one who cannot. Generally, this gap does not narrow later. This results in a wide range of vocabulary by age five or six, when an English-speaking child will have learned about 1500 words.<ref>"Vocabulary". Sebastian Wren, Ph.D. BalancedReading.com http://www.balancedreading.com/vocabulary.html</ref>

Vocabulary grows throughout our entire life. Between the ages of 20 and 60, people learn some 6,000 more lemmas, or one every other day.<ref name="HowMany2016" /> An average 20-year-old knows 42,000 words coming from 11,100 word families; an average 60-year-old knows 48,200 lemmas coming from 13,400 word families.<ref name="HowMany2016" /> People expand their vocabularies by e.g. reading, playing word games, and participating in vocabulary-related programs. Exposure to traditional print media teaches correct spelling and vocabulary, while exposure to text messaging leads to more relaxed word acceptability constraints.<ref>Cite thesis |type= M.

 Vocabulary size 

= Native-language vocabulary =
Estimating average vocabulary size poses various difficulties and limitations due to the different definitions and methods employed such as what is the word, what is to know a word, what sample dictionaries were used, how tests were conducted, and so on.<ref name="HowMany2016" /><ref name="GouldenNationRead1990" /><ref name="D'AnnaZechmeisterHall1991" /><ref>cite journal|last1=Nation|first1=I.

As a result estimates vary from as little as 10,000 to as many as over 50,000 for young adult native speakers of English.<ref name="HowMany2016" /><ref name="GouldenNationRead1990">cite journal|last1=Goulden|first1=Robin|last2=Nation|first2=Paul|last3=Read|first3=John|title=How Large Can a Receptive Vocabulary Be?|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=1 December 1990|volume=11|issue=4|pages=341–363|doi=10.1093/applin/11.4.341|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/1990-Goulden-Voc-size.pdf</ref><ref name="D'AnnaZechmeisterHall1991">cite journal|last1=D'Anna|first1=Catherine|last2=Zechmeister|first2=Eugene|last3=Hall|first3=James|title=Toward a meaningful definition of vocabulary size|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|date=1 March 1991|volume=23|issue=1|pages=109–122|doi=10.1080/10862969109547729</ref><ref>cite journal|last1=Milton|first1=James|last2=Treffers-Daller|first2=Jeanine|title=Vocabulary size revisited: the link between vocabulary size and academic achievement|journal=Applied Linguistics Review|date=29 January 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=151–172|doi=10.1515/applirev-2013-0007|url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/29879/</ref>

One most recent 2016 study shows that 20-year-old English native speakers recognize on average 42,000 Lemma (morphology)|lemmas, ranging from 27,100 for the lowest 5% of the population to 51,700 lemmas for the highest 5%. These lemmas come from 6,100 word families in the lowest 5% of the population and 14,900 word families in the highest 5%. 60-year-olds know on average 6,000 lemmas more.

According to another, earlier 1995 study junior-high students would be able to recognize the meanings of about 10,000–12,000 words, whereas for college students this number grows up to about 12,000–17,000 and for elderly adults up to about 17,000 or more.<ref>cite journal|last1=Zechmeister|first1=Eugene|last2=Chronis|first2=Andrea|last3=Cull|first3=William|last4=D'Anna|first4=Catherine|last5=Healy|first5=Noreen|title=Growth of a functionally important lexicon|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|date=1 June 1995|volume=27|issue=2|pages=201–212|doi=10.1080/10862969509547878</ref>

 Second language vocabulary acquisition 
Learning vocabulary is one of the first steps in learning a second language, but a learner never finishes vocabulary acquisition. Whether in one's native language or a second language, the acquisition of new vocabulary is an ongoing process. There are many techniques that help one acquire new vocabulary.

 Memorization 
Although memorization can be seen as tedious or boring, associating one word in the native language with the corresponding word in the second language until memorized is considered one of the best methods of vocabulary acquisition. By the time students reach adulthood, they generally have gathered a number of personalized memorization methods. Although many argue that memorization does not typically require the complex cognitive processing that increases retention (Sagarra and Alba, 2006),<ref name="Spanish p. 228-243">Sagarra, Nuria and Alba, Matthew. (2006). "The Key Is in the Keyword: L2 Vocabulary Learning Methods With Beginning Learners of Spanish". ''The Modern Language Journal'', 90, ii. pp. 228–243.</ref> it does typically require a large amount of repetition, and spaced repetition with flashcards is an established method for memorization, particularly used for vocabulary acquisition in computer-assisted language learning. Other methods typically require more time and longer to recall.

Some words cannot be easily linked through association or other methods. When a word in the second language is phonologically or visually similar to a word in the native language, one often assumes they also share semantic similarity|similar meanings. Though this is frequently the case, it is not always true. When faced with a false friend, memorization and repetition are the keys to mastery. If a second language learner relies solely on word associations to learn new vocabulary, that person will have a very difficult time mastering false friends. When large amounts of vocabulary must be acquired in a limited amount of time, when the learner needs to recall information quickly, when words represent abstract concepts or are difficult to picture in a mental image, or when discriminating between false friends, rote memorization is the method to use. A neural network model of novel word learning across orthographies, accounting for L1-specific memorization abilities of L2-learners has recently been introduced (Hadzibeganovic and Cannas, 2009).<ref name="novel word learning">Hadzibeganovic Tarik and Cannas, Sergio A. (2009). "A Tsallis' statistics-based neural network model for novel word learning". ''Physica A'', 388, pp. 732–746.</ref>

 The Keyword Method 
One useful method of building vocabulary in a second language is the keyword method. If time is available or one wants to emphasize a few key words, one can create mnemonic devices or word associations. Although these strategies tend to take longer to implement and may take longer in recollection, they create new or unusual connections that can increase retention. The keyword method requires deeper cognitive processing, thus increasing the likelihood of retention (Sagarra and Alba, 2006).<ref name="Spanish p. 228-243"/> This method uses fits within Paivio's (1986)<ref>Paivio, A. (1986). ''Mental Representations: A Dual Coding Approach''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> dual coding theory because it uses both verbal and image memory systems. However, this method is best for words that represent concrete and imageable things. Abstract concepts or words that do not bring a distinct image to mind are difficult to associate. In addition, studies have shown that associative vocabulary learning is more successful with younger students (Sagarra and Alba, 2006).<ref name="Spanish p. 228-243"/> Older students tend to rely less on creating word associations to remember vocabulary.

= Word lists =

Several word lists have been developed to provide people with a limited vocabulary either for the purpose of rapid language proficiency or for effective communication. These include Basic English (850 words), Special English (1,500 words), General Service List (2,000 words), and Academic Word List. Some Advanced learner's dictionary|learner's dictionaries have developed Defining vocabulary|defining vocabularies which contain only most common and basic words. As a result word definitions in such dictionaries can be understood even by learners with a limited vocabulary.<ref>cite journal|last1=Bogaards|first1=Paul|title=The evolution of learners' dictionaries and ''Merriam-Webster's Advanced Learner's English Dictionary''|journal=Kernerman Dictionary News|date=July 2010|issue=18|pages=6–15|url=http://kdictionaries.com/kdn/kdn18.pdf</ref><ref>[http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/oxford3000 Oxford 3000]</ref><ref>[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/learn/clear-definitions.html The Macmillan Defining Vocabulary]</ref> Some publishers produce dictionaries based on word frequency<ref>[https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Frequency-Dictionaries/book-series/RFD Routledge Frequency Dictionaries]</ref> or thematic groups.<ref>icon de [http://www.langenscheidt.de/Langenscheidt-Grundwortschatz Langenscheidt Grundwortschatz]</ref><ref>icon de [http://www.langenscheidt.de/Langenscheidt-Grund-und-Aufbauwortschatz Langenscheidt Grund- und Aufbauwortschatz]</ref><ref>icon de [https://shop.hueber.de/de/catalogsearch/result/?q=Grundwortschatz Hueber Grundwortschatz]</ref>
