Neuropsychology
Neurocognitive functions are cognitive functions closely linked to the function of particular areas, neural pathways, or Cerebral cortex|cortical networks in the brain substrate layers of neurological matrix at the cellular molecular level. Therefore, their understanding is closely linked to the practice of neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience, two disciplines that broadly seek to understand how the structure and function of the brain relate to cognition and behaviour.

A neurocognitive deficit is a reduction or impairment of cognitive function in one of these areas, but particularly when physical changes can be seen to have occurred in the brain, such as after neurological illness, mental illness, medication|drug use, or Acquired brain injury|brain injury.<ref>cite journal|last1=Blazer|first1=Dan|title=Commentary: Neurocognitive Disorders in DSM-5|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=170|issue=6|pages=585â€“587|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13020179|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13020179|year=2013</ref>

A clinical neuropsychologist may specialise in using neuropsychological tests to detect and understand such deficits, and may be involved in the Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation of an affected person. The discipline that studies neurocognitive deficits to infer normal psychological function is called cognitive neuropsychology.
