Nomenclature
Travellers refer to themselves as ''Minkiers''<ref>cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/08/world/tullamore-journal-travelers-tale-irish-nomads-make-little-headway.html?pagewanted=2|work=The New York Times|title=Tullamore Journal; Travelers' Tale: Irish Nomads Make Little Headway|first=James F.|last=Clarity|date=8 February 1999</ref> or ''Pavees'', or in Irish as lang|ga|an Lucht Siúil ("the travelling people").

Deeper documentation of Shelta and the Travellers dates to the 1830s, but knowledge of Irish Travellers has been seen from the 1100s, as well as the 1500s-1800s. Many decrees against begging in England were directed at Travellers, passed by King Edward VI around 1551. One such decree was the “Acte for tynckers and pedlers”.<ref>Cite book|title=Tinkers and Travellers|last=Gmelch|first=Sharon|publisher=The O'Brien Press|year=1975|isbn=0 905140 69 9|location=Dublin|pages=10</ref> Travellers make up a minority group of Ireland who are nomadic.

=Origin theories=

Many different theories have been put forward to explain the origins of Ireland's nomadic populations. A suggestion that they might be of Romani people|Romani extraction<ref>cite book|last=Griffin|first=Rosarii |year=2014|title=Education in Indigenous, Nomadic and Travelling Communities|language=en |location=|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9781472511195|page=50|url=</ref> is not supported by genetic evidence, which finds no connection to Romani groups.<ref>http://www.rcsi.ie/index.jsp?n=145&p=107&a=10373</ref> One idea is of them being distantly related to a Celtic group that invaded Ireland. Another theory is of a pre-Gaelic origin, where Travellers are descended from a community that lived in Ireland before the arrival of the Celts. Once Ireland was claimed as Celtic, this group was seen as lower class.<ref name="Keane2005">cite journal|last=Keane|first=David|author-link=|date=2005|title=International law and the ethnicity of Irish Travellers|journal=Washington and Lee Journal of Civil Rights and Social Justice|volume=11|issue=1|page=|issn=1942-5732|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/crsj/vol11/iss1/4|access-date= open access</ref> There is also a theory that an indigenous, nomadic, community of craftsmen are the ancestors of Travellers, and they never settled down like the Celts.<ref>Cite book|title=Irish Travellers, Culture and Ethnicity|last=Ní Shúinéar|first=Sinéad|publisher=W & G Baird Ltd.|year=1994|isbn=0 85389 493 0|location=Belfast|pages=70–72</ref> Other speculations on their origin are that they were descended from those Irish who were made homeless during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the 1650s, or made homeless in either the 1741 or the The Great Hunger|1840s famine due to eviction.<ref name="Keane2005" />rp|56rp|43<ref>cite book|last=|first=|author-link=|year=2014|chapter=|chapterurl=|editor-last=Griffin|editor-first=Rosarii|title=Education in indigenous, nomadic and travelling communities|series=Education as a humanitarian response|location=London|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-4725-1119-5|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gK2AwAAQBAJ author missing</ref> Genetic research has ruled these events out as the founding events for Travellers, however it cannot rule out the displacement of the population along with most of the Irish population during these events.

It has since been recognised that no single explanation is likely to be adequate in answering this complex question. Current scholarship is investigating the background of Gaelic Ireland before the Tudor conquest of Ireland|English Tudor conquest. The mobile nature and traditions of a Gaelic society based on pastoralism rather than land tenure before this event implies that Travellers represent descendants of the Gaelic social order marginalised during the change-over to an English landholding society.<ref>Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zr6VRPmZjV8C&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Irish Travellers: Racism and the Politics of Culture| isbn=9780802086280| last1=Helleiner| first1=Jane| date=May 2003</ref> An early example of this mobile element in the population, and how displacement of clans can lead to increased nomadism within aristocratic warrior societies, is that of the Clan Muircheartaigh Uí Conchobhair|Clan Murtough O' Connors, displaced after the Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion.<ref>Cite journal |jstor = 25535718|title = A Lost Tribe: The Clan Murtagh O'Conors|journal = Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society|volume = 53|pages = 1–22|last1 = Simms|first1 = Katharine|year = 2001</ref>

In 2017 a further genetic study using profiles of 50 Irish Travellers, 143 European Roma, 2232 settled Irish, 2039 British and 6255 European or worldwide individuals confirmed ancestral origin within the general Irish population. An estimated time of divergence between the settled population and Travellers was set at a minimum of 8 generations ago, with generations at 30 years, hence 240 years and a maximum of 14 generations or 420 years ago. The best fit was estimated at 360 years ago, giving an approximate date in the 1650s.<ref>Cite web | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/travellers-as-genetically-different-from-settled-irish-as-spanish-1.2969515 | title=Travellers as 'genetically different' from settled Irish as Spanish</ref> This date coincides remarkably well with the final destruction of Gaelic society following the 1641 Rebellion and during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in which Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's forces devastated the country.

Irish Travellers are not an entirely homogeneous group instead reflecting some of the variation also seen in the settled population. Four distinct genetic clusters were identified in the 2017 study, and these match social groupings within the community.<ref>cite book|last=Gmelch|first=Sharon|author-link=|year=1991|orig-year=©1986|chapter=Preface|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9foVAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA11|title=Nan: the life of an Irish Travelling woman|type=Biography|edition=Reissue with changes|location=Long Grove, IL|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=978-0-88133-602-3|pages=11–14</ref>

Genetic disease studies
Genetic studies by Miriam Murphy, David Croke, and other researchers identified certain genetic diseases such as galactosemia that are more common in the Irish Traveller population, involving identifiable allele|allelic mutations that are rarer among the rest of the community.

Two main hypotheses have arisen, speculating whether:
# this resulted from marriages made largely within and among the Traveller community, or
# suggesting descent from an Founder effect|original Irish carrier long ago with ancestors unrelated to the rest of the Irish population.<ref>cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Miriam|last2=McHugh|first2=Brian|last3=Tighe|first3=Orna|last4=Mayne|first4=Philip|last5=O'Neill|first5=Charles|last6=Naughten|first6=Eileen|last7=Croke|first7=David T.|date=July 1999|title=Genetic basis of transferase-deficient galactosaemia in Ireland and the population history of the Irish Travellers|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|volume=7|issue=5|pages=549–554|pmid=10439960|issn=1476-5438|url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v7/n5/pdf/5200327a.pdf|access-date=|doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200327</ref>
They concluded that: "The fact that Q188R is the sole mutant allele among the Travellers as compared to the non-Traveller group may be the result of a founder effect in the isolation of a small group of the Irish population from their peers as founders of the Traveller sub-population. This would favour the second, endogenous, hypothesis of Traveller origins."

More specifically, they found that Q188R was found in 100% of Traveller samples, and in 89% of other Irish samples, indicating that the Traveller group was typical of the larger Irish  population.<ref>Murphy et al., op cit., p. 552, discussion section</ref>

Language
Irish Travellers speak English and sometimes one of two dialects of Shelta, Gammon (or Gamin) and Irish Traveller Cant. Shelta has been dated back to the 18th century, but may be older.<ref>Sharon Gmlech, op. cit., p. 234</ref> Cant (language)|Cant, which derives from Irish language|Irish, is a combination of English and Shelta.<ref name="Andereck1996"/>

Shelta is a secret language. Travellers do not like to share the language with outsiders, named “Buffers”, or non-travellers.

The Irish state and Irish Travellers

There was no specific state focus on Travellers prior to the establishment of the Irish Republic|Irish republic in 1949. Issues with mobile sections of the population came under loosely defined vagrancy laws, ultimately of English origin. In 1959 the Government of the 17th Dáil|1959–63 government of Ireland established a "Commission on Itinerancy" in response to calls to deal with the "itinerant problem". This was made up of senior representatives of the Irish state, judges, Gardaí, religious organisations and numerous farming lobby groups such as Macra na Feirme. The Commission had no Traveller representatives, neither were they consulted.<ref name="imi.ox.ac.uk">Cite journal | url=https://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/publications/wp-109-15 | title=The making of the Irish Traveller Community: Mobility discourse, settlement policies and the Irish state 1950-2010| journal=Imi Working Paper Series| volume=109| date=2015-02-23| last1=Ruckstuhl| first1=Ina</ref> The Commission had the following terms of reference:sfn|Commission on Itinerancy|1963|p=11

:(2) to examine the economic, educational, health and social problems inherent in their way of life;
:(3) to consider what steps might be taken—

::(c) pending such absorption, to reduce to a minimum the disadvantages to themselves and to the community resulting from their itinerant habits and
::(d) to improve the position generally; and
:(4) to make recommendations.

The Commission's 1963 report defined "itinerant" as "a person who had no fixed place of abode and habitually wandered from place to place, but excluding carny|travelling show-people and travelling entertainers".sfn|Commission on Itinerancy|1963|p=12 It recommended Cultural assimilation|assimilation of travellers by settling them in fixed dwellings, viewing the Netherlands' approach to its travelling minority as a model.sfn|Commission on Itinerancy|1963|pp=28, 106 This assimilation was to be achieved by the effective criminalisation of nomadism, and the report paved the way for an increasing state emphasis on criminal laws and penalties for trespass.<ref name="imi.ox.ac.uk"/>

From the 2006 Irish census it was determined that 20,975 dwell in urban areas and 1,460 were living in rural areas. With an overall population of just 0.5% some areas were found to have a higher proportion, with high Traveller concentrations in Clare, Dublin, Galway and Limerick. There were found to be 9,301 Travellers in the 0–14 age range, comprising 41.5% of the Traveller population, and a further 3,406 of them were in the 15–24 age range, comprising 15.2%. Children of age range 0–17 comprised 48.7% of the Traveller population.

Following the findings of the All Ireland Traveller Health Study (estimates for 2008), the figure for Northern Ireland was revised to 3,905 and that for the Republic to 36,224.<ref name="Abdalla2010">cite book|last1=Abdalla|first1=Safa|last2=Quirke|first2=Brigid|last3=Fitzpatrick|first3=Patricia|last4=Daly|first4=Leslie|display-authors=1|date=September 2010|editor-last=Kelleher|editor-first=Cecily|title=Demography & Vital Statistics Part A of Technical Report 2|series=All Ireland Traveller health study|location=Dublin|publisher=School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Population Science, University College Dublin|page=20|url=http://www.dohc.ie/publications/aiths2010/TR2/AITHS2010_TechnicalReport2_HR_PartA.pdf?direct=1|access-date=2011-03-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317184057/http://www.dohc.ie/publications/aiths2010/TR2/AITHS2010_TechnicalReport2_HR_PartA.pdf?direct=1|archivedate=2012-03-17|deadurl=yes</ref>

The London Boroughs of London Borough of Harrow|Harrow and London Borough of Brent|Brent contain significant Irish Traveller populations. In addition to those on various official sites there are a number who are settled in local authority housing. These are mostly women who wish their children to have a chance at a good education.

Travellers in the US are said to speak English and Shelta, a form of Cant. The Cant spoken in the US is similar to the Cant spoken in Ireland, but differs in some respects in that the language has transformed into a type of pidgin English over the generations. They typically work in asphalting, spray-painting, laying linoleum, or as itinerant workers to earn their living.<ref name="Andereck1992"/><ref name="Andereck1996"/>

Health

The health of Irish Travellers is significantly poorer than that of the general population in Ireland. This is evidenced in a 2007 report published in Ireland, which states that over half of Travellers do not live past the age of 39 years.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2007/0625/breaking43.htm|title=50% of Travellers die before 39 - study|date=25 June 2007|work=The Irish Times</ref> (By comparison median life expectancy in Ireland is 81.5 years.) Another government report of 1987 found:

Female Travellers have especially high mortality compared to settled women.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.dohc.ie/about_us/divisions/social_inclusion/travellers_health_status_study_1987.pdf?direct=1 |title=The Travellers' Health Status Study |year=1987 |publisher=Irish Dept. of Health |accessdate=15 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120045307/http://www.dohc.ie/about_us/divisions/social_inclusion/travellers_health_status_study_1987.pdf?direct=1 |archivedate=20 November 2007 |df=  p24</ref></blockquote>

In 2007, the Department of Health (Ireland)|Department of Health and Children in the Republic of Ireland, in conjunction with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland, commissioned the University College Dublin's School of Public Health and Population Science to conduct a major cross-border study of Travellers' welfare. The study, including a detailed census of Traveller population and an examination of their health status, was expected to take up to three years to complete.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/news/july07/100707_traveller.html|title=Minister Harney Launches All-Ireland Traveller Health Study|date=10 July 2007|publisher=UCD|accessdate=15 June 2009</ref> The main results of the study were published in 2010.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/issda/data/allirelandtravellerhealthstudy/|title=All Ireland Traveller Health Study|date=September 2010|publisher=UCD|accessdate=11 November 2015</ref>

The birth rate of Irish Travellers has decreased since the 1990s, but they still have one of the highest birth rates in Europe. The birth rate for the Traveller community for the year 2005 was 33.32 per 1,000, possibly the highest birth rate recorded for any community in Europe.

On average there are ten times more driving fatalities within the Traveller community. At 22%, this represents the most common cause of death among Traveller males. Some 10% of Traveller children die before their second birthday, compared to just 1% of the general population. In Ireland, 2.6% of all deaths in the total population were for people aged under 25, versus 32% for the Travellers.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/life-expectancy-of-irish-travellers-still-at-1940s-levels-despite-economic-boom-454993.html "Life expectancy of Irish travellers still at 1940s levels despite economic boom"].

Travellers are often reported as the subject of explicit political and cultural discrimination, with politicians being elected on promises to block Traveller housing in local communities and individuals frequently refused service in pubs, shops and hotels.<ref>cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/world/europe/deadly-fire-exposes-irelands-contempt-for-traveler-minority-group.html?ref=world | title=Sympathy Is Short-Lived for Irish Minority Group After Deadly Fire | newspaper=The New York Times | date=29 October 2015 | accessdate=30 October 2015 | author=DALBY, DOUGLAS</ref>

A 2011 survey by the Economic and Social Research Institute of Ireland concluded that there is widespread ostracism of Travellers in Ireland, and the report concluded that it could hurt the long-term prospects for Travellers, who "need the intercultural solidarity of their neighbours in the settled community.&nbsp;...

Since the majority of Irish Travellers' employment is either self-employment or wage labour, income and financial status varies greatly from family to family.

The Commission on Itinerancy, appointed in Ireland in 1960 under Charles Haughey, found that "public brawling fuelled by excessive drinking further added to settled people's fear of Travellers&nbsp;... feuding was felt to be the result of a dearth of pastimes and [of] illiteracy, historically comparable to features of rural Irish life before the Famine]."<ref>Cite book|last=Bhreatnach|first=Aoife|title=Becoming conspicuous: Irish travellers, society and the state, 1922–70|publisher=University College Dublin Press|year= 2006|page=108|isbn=978-1-904558-61-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yQd1AAAAMAAJ&dq=irish+travellers+feuding&q=+feuding#search_anchor</ref>

Further|Halting site
A common complaint against Travellers in the United Kingdom is that of unauthorised Traveller sites being established on privately owned land or on council-owned land not designated for that purpose. Under the government's "''Gypsy and Traveller Sites Grant''", designated sites for Travellers' use are provided by councils, and funds are made available to local authorities for the construction of new sites and maintenance and extension of existing sites.

However, Travellers make frequent use of other, non-authorised sites.  These include public "common land" and private plots such as large fields and other privately owned land. A famous example was Dale Farm in Essex. The Travellers claim that there is an under-provision of authorised sites. The Gypsy Council estimates an under-provision amounts to insufficient sites for 3,500 people.<ref>cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4213875.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Councils 'must find Gypsy sites'|work=bbc.co.uk|date=2005-01-27</ref>

The passing of the Caravan Sites Act 1968, for some time, safeguarded their right to a site, but the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 repealed part II of the 1968 act, removing the duty on local authorities in the UK to provide sites for Travellers and giving them the power to close down existing sites. In Northern Ireland, opposition to Travellers' sites has been led by the Democratic Unionist Party.<ref name="Hainsworth" />

Depictions and documentaries
Further|List of Irish Traveller-related depictions and documentaries
Irish Travellers have been depicted, usually negatively but sometimes with some care and sympathy, in film, radio, print, and television. Shows like ''The Riches'' (2007–2008), the American television series featuring Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver, take a deeper look into the Traveller lifestyle. The documentary series ''Big Fat Gypsy Weddings'' (2010, 2011, and 2012) has been commercially successful in the United Kingdom, offering glimpses of Traveller life as viewed at real-life weddings. A 1997 American film, ''Traveller (1997 film)|Traveller'', starring Bill Paxton and Mark Wahlberg, also explored the Travellers in America.
