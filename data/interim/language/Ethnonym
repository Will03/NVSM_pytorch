Short description|Name of an ethnic group

An ethnonym (from the lang-el|ἔθνος, ''éthnos'', "nation" and lang|grc|ὄνομα, ''ónoma'', "name") is a name applied to a given ethnic group. Ethnonyms can be divided into two categories: exonyms  (whose name of the ethnic group has been created by another group of people) and autonyms, or endonyms (whose name is created and used by the ethnic group itself).

As an example, the ethnonym for the ethnically-dominant group in Germany is the Germans. That ethnonym is an exonym used in English language|English but itself comes from Latin. Conversely, Germans themselves use the autonym of ''Deutschen''. Germans are indicated by exonyms in many other European languages, such as French language|French (''Allemands''), Italian language|Italian (''tedeschi''), Swedish language|Swedish (''tyskar'') and Polish language|Polish (''Niemcy'').

 Variations 
Numerous ethnonyms can apply to the same ethnic or racial group, with various levels of recognition, acceptance and use. The State Library of South Australia contemplated this issue when considering Library of Congress Headings for literature pertaining to Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Some 20 different ethnonyms were considered as potential Library of Congress headings, but it was recommended that only a fraction of them be employed for the purposes of cataloguing.<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/niac/libs/martin.html Aboriginal Rountable (1995): LCSH for ATSI People<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>

 Change over time 

Ethnonyms can change in character over time; while originally socially acceptable, they may List of ethnic group names used as insults|come to be considered offensive. For instance, the term Wikt:gypsy|Gypsy has been used to refer to the Romani people|Romani. Other examples include Vandals|Vandal, Bushmen|Bushman, Barbarian, and Philistine.

The ethnonyms applied to African Americans have demonstrated a greater evolution; older terms such as ''colored people|colored'' carried negative connotations and have been replaced by modern-day equivalents such as ''African-American''.citation needed|date=September 2015 Other ethnonyms such as ''Negro'' have a different status. The term was considered acceptable in its use by activists such as Martin Luther King in the 1960s,<ref name="Jr.Holloran2005">cite book|last1=Jr.|first1=Martin Luther King,|last2=Holloran|first2=Peter|last3=Luker|first3=Ralph E.|author4=Penny A.

In discussing an address in 1960 by Elijah Muhammad, it was stated "to the Muslims, terms like Negro and colored are labels created by white people to negate the past greatness of the black race".<ref>[http://www.albany.edu/jmmh/vol1no1/elijahmuhammad.html Message from the Wilderness of North America.

Four decades later, a similar difference of opinion remains. In 2006, one commentator suggested that the term Negro is outdated or offensive in many quarters; similarly, the word "colored" still appears in the name of the NAACP, or National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

In such contexts, ethnonyms are susceptible to the phenomenon of the euphemism treadmill.<ref>cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515171806/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1994_04_03_newyorktimes.pdf |title=The game of the name |newspaper=Baltimore Sun |archivedate=2011-05-15 |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1994_04_03_newyorktimes.pdf |date=1994-04-03 |accessdate=2011-01-19 |deadurl=yes |df= </ref>

 Linguistics 

main|Demonym
In English, ethnonyms are generally formulated through suffixation; most ethnonyms for toponyms ending in ''-a'' are formed by adding ''-n'': ''America, American''; ''Austria, Austrian''. In English, in many cases, the word for the dominant natural language|language of a group is identical to their English-language ethnonym; the French speak French, the Germans speak German. This is sometimes erroneously overgeneralized; it may be assumed that people from India speak "Indian",<ref name="BournePollard2002">cite book|last1=Bourne|first1=Jill|last2=Pollard|first2=Andrew|title=Teaching and Learning in the Primary School|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOsXN9eJvDkC&pg=PA34|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=26 September 2002|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-42511-4|page=34</ref> despite there being no language in India which is called by that name.

Generally, any group of people may have numerous ethnonyms associated with the political affiliation with a state or a province, with geographical landmark, with the language, or another distinct feature. Ethnonym may be a compound word releted to origin or usage, ''polito-ethnonym'' indicates that name originated from the political affiliation, like ''Belgian'' for inhabitants of Belgium that have their own endonyms;  ''topo-ethnonym'' refers to the ethnonym derived from the name of the locality, like ''Uralians'' for the inhabitants of the geographical area near the Ural mountains that have their own distinct endonyms. Classical geographers frequently used topo-ethnonyms (demonyms) as substitute for ethnonyms in general descriptions or for unknown endonyms. Compound teminology is widely used in professional literature to discriminate semantics of the terms.
