A department store is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as "departments".  In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (''Le Bon Marché'' in 1852) and in New York (with Alexander Turney Stewart|Stewart's).<ref>Gunther Barth, "The Department Store," in ''City People: The Rise of Modern City Culture in Nineteenth-Century America.'' (Oxford University Press, 1980) pp 110–47,</ref>

Today, departments often include the following: clothing, furniture, home appliances, toys, cosmetics, houseware, gardening, toiletries, sporting goods, do it yourself, paint, and hardware. Additionally, other lines of products such as food, books, jewelry, electronics, stationery, photographic equipment, baby products, and products for pets are sometimes included. Customers generally check out near the front of the store, although some stores include sales counters within each department. Some stores are one of many within a larger retail chain, while others are independent retailers. In the 1970s, they came under heavy pressure from discounters, and have come under even heavier pressure from e-commerce sites since 2010. Big-box stores, hypermarkets, and discount stores are comparable to historical department stores.

History
=Britain=

The origins of the departmental store lay in the growth of the conspicuous consumer society at the turn of the 19th century. As the Industrial Revolution accelerated economy expansion, the affluent middle-class grew in size and wealth. Urbanized social groups, sharing a culture of consumption and changing fashions, were the catalyst for the retail revolution. As rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people, especially women (who found they could shop unaccompanied at department stores without damaging their reputation),<ref>* Citation | last = Woodham | first = Jonathan | year = 1997 | title = Twentieth-Century Design | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York, NY, USA and London, UK | oclc = 35777427 | isbn = 0192842048 pg. 15</ref> with disposable income in the late Georgian period, window shopping was transformed into a leisure|leisure activity and entrepreneurs, like the potter Josiah Wedgwood, pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence the prevailing tastes and preferences of society.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.quarc.de/fileadmin/downloads/Coming%20to%20live%20in%20a%20consumer%20society%20%28chapter%202%29.pdf|title=Coming to live in a consumer society</ref> Department stores also often featured post services, childcare services, restaurants and other services that appealed to female shoppers.<ref>* Citation | last = Winston | first = Sydnee C. | year = 2017 | title = Department Stores: Changing the Fashion Pattern | publisher = National Women's History Museum | url = https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/department-stores-changing-fashion-pattern</ref>

One of the first department stores may have been Bennett's in Derby, first established as an ironmonger (hardware shop) in 1734.<ref name="derbyshire">cite news| title=Bennetts Irongate, Derby Celebrates Its 275th Anniversary| date=6 January 2010| author=Natalie Loughenbury| url=http://www.bennettsirongate.co.uk/bennetts/bennetts-derby-history.php| work=Derbshire Life| publisher=Bennets| accessdate=2012-01-26</ref> It still stands to this day, trading in the same building.

<blockquote>The house is one hundred and fifty feet in length from front to back, and of proportionate width. It is fitted up with great taste, and is divided by glazed partitions into four departments, for the various branches of the extensive business, which is there carried on. Immediately at the entrance is the first department, which is exclusively appropriated to the sale of furs and fans. The second contains articles of haberdashery of every description, silks, muslins, lace, gloves, &etc. In the third shop, on the right, you meet with a rich assortment of jewelry, ornamental articles in ormolu, french clocks, &etc.; and on the left, with all the different kinds of perfumery necessary for the toilette. The fourth is set apart for millinery and dresses; so that there is no article of female attire or decoration, but what may be here procured in the first style of elegance and fashion. This concern has been conducted for the last twelve years by the present proprietors who have spared neither trouble nor expense to ensure the establishment of a superiority over every other in Europe, and to render it perfectly unique in its kind.<ref>cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/repositoryofarts109acke|title=The Repository of arts, literature, commerce, manufactures, fashions and politics (1809)</ref></blockquote>

The store was especially known for its emphasis on quality and style over low prices giving it the nickname "the Harrods of the North", although this was due in part to Harrods acquiring the store in 1919. Other large Manchester stores included Paulden's (currently Debenhams) and Lewis's (now a Primark).
In London, department stores were established in Oxford Street and Regent Street in the mid 19th-century. These were distinctly modern stores with lavish displays of imported goods, especially Oriental shawls, embroidery and furniture and served a wealthy clientele.<ref>Iarocci, L., ''Visual Merchandising: The Image of Selling'', Ashgate Publishing, 2013, pp 120-121</ref> Harrods of London can be traced back to 1834, while the current store on Brompton Road on a site they acquired in 1849, was constructed between 1894 and 1905.

Selfridges was established in 1909 by American-born Harry Gordon Selfridge on Selfridges, Oxford Street|Oxford Street. The company's innovative marketing promoted the radical notion of shopping for pleasure rather than necessity and its techniques were adopted by modern department stores the world over. The store was extensively promoted through paid advertising. The shop floors were structured so that goods could be made more accessible to customers. There were elegant restaurants with modest prices, a library, reading and writing rooms, special reception rooms for French, German, American and "Colonial" customers, a First Aid Room, and a Silence Room, with soft lights, deep chairs, and double-glazing, all intended to keep customers in the store as long as possible. Staff members were taught to be on hand to ''assist'' customers, but not too aggressively, and to ''sell'' the merchandise.<ref>J.A. Gere and John Sparrow (ed.), ''Geoffrey Madan's Notebooks'', Oxford University Press, 1981</ref> Selfridge attracted shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits; in 1909, Louis Blériot's monoplane was exhibited at Selfridges (Blériot was the first to fly over the English Channel), and the first public demonstration of television by John Logie Baird took place in the department store in 1925.

In Scotland, Jenners was founded by Charles Jenner and Charles Kennington and has maintained its position on Edinburgh's Princes Street since 1838. It lays claim to being the oldest independent department store in Scotland.

float_box|File:Au Bon Marché (vue générale - gravure).jpg|thumb|300px|Au Bon Marché
The Paris department store had its roots in the ''magasin de nouveautés'', or novelty store; the first, the Tapis Rouge, was created in 1784.  They flourished in the early 19th century, with ''La Belle Jardiniere'' (1824),  ''Aux Trois Quartiers'' (1829), and ''Le Petit Saint Thomas'' (1830). Balzac described their functioning in his novel ''César Birotteau''.  In the 1840s, with the arrival of the railroads in Paris and the increased number of shoppers they brought, they grew in size, and began to have large plate glass display windows, fixed prices and price tags, and advertising in newspapers.<ref>cite book|last=Fierro|first=Alfred|title=Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris|year=1996|pages=911–912</ref>

A novelty shop called ''Le Bon Marché|Au Bon Marché'' had been founded in Paris in 1838 to sell lace, ribbons, sheets, mattresses, buttons, umbrellas and other assorted goods.  It originally had four departments, twelve employees, and a floor space of three hundred meters. The entrepreneur Aristide Boucicaut became a partner in 1852, and changed the marketing plan, instituting fixed prices and guarantees that allowed exchanges and refunds, advertising, and a much wider variety of merchandise. The annual income of the store increased from 500,000 francs in 1852 to five million in 1860. In 1869 he built much larger building at 24 rue de Sèvres on the Left Bank, and enlarged the store again in 1872, with help from the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel, creator of the Eiffel Tower.  The income rose from twenty million francs in 1870 to 72 million at the time of the Boucicaut's death in 1877.  The floor space had increased from three hundred square meters in 1838 to fifty thousand, and the number of employees had increased from twelve in 1838 to 1788 in 1879.  Boucicaut was famous for his marketing innovations; a reading room for husbands while their wives shopped; extensive newspaper advertising; entertainment for children; and six million catalogs sent out to customers. By 1880 half the employees were women; unmarried women employees lived in dormitories on the upper floors.<ref name="world">cite book| title=The World of Department Stores| author=Jan Whitaker| page=22| publisher=Vendome Press| place=New York| year=2011| isbn=978-0-86565-264-4</ref>

''Au Bon Marché'' soon had competitors.  ''Printemps'' was founded in 1865; La Samaritaine was founded in 1869 by Ernest Cognacq and Marie-Louise Jay, a new ''Tapis Rouge'' in 1867, ''La Ville de Saint-Denis'', with the first elevator in France (1869);  ''La Paix'';  ''Les Nouvelles Galeries''; ''Les Magasins Dufayel'' (1890); the ''Bazaar de Hotel de Ville'' (Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville|BHV); and ''Galeries Lafayette'', founded by Alphonse Kahn in 1895.<ref>Fierro (1996), pages 911–912</ref><ref>Michael B.

The Grands Magasins Dufayel was a huge department store with inexpensive prices built in 1890 in the northern part of Paris, where it reached a very large new customer base in the working class. In a neighborhood with few public spaces, it provided a consumer version of the public square. It educated workers to approach shopping as an exciting social activity not just a routine exercise in obtaining necessities, just as the bourgeoisie did at the famous department stores in the central city. Like the bourgeois stores, it helped transform consumption from a business transaction into a direct relationship between consumer and sought-after goods. Its advertisements promised the opportunity to participate in the newest, most fashionable consumerism at reasonable cost. The latest technology was featured, such as cinemas and exhibits of inventions like X-ray machines (that could be used to fit shoes) and the gramophone.<ref>Brian Wemp, "Social Space, Technology, and Consumer Culture at the Grands Magasins Dufayel," ''Historical Reflections'' (2011) 37#1 pp 1–17.</ref>

Increasingly after 1870 the stores' work force became feminized, opening up prestigious job opportunities for young women. Despite the low pay and long hours they enjoyed the exciting complex interactions with the newest and most fashionable merchandise and upscale customers.<ref>Theresa M.

New York City
Arnold Constable & Company|Arnold Constable was the first American department store. It was founded in 1825 by Aaron Arnold (1794?–1876), an emigrant from Great Britain, as a small dry goods store on Pine Street in New York City. In 1857 the store moved into a five-story white marble dry goods palace known as the Marble House. During the Civil War, Arnold Constable was one of the first stores to issue charge bills of credit to its customers each month instead of on a bi-annual basis.  Recognized as an emporium for high-quality fashions, the store soon outgrew the Marble House and erected a cast-iron building on Broadway and Nineteenth Street in 1869; this “Palace of Trade” expanded over the years until it was necessary to move into a larger space in 1914. In 1925, Arnold, Constable merged with Stewart & Company and expanded into the suburbs, first with a 1937 store in New Rochelle, New York and later in Hempstead and Manhasset on Long Island, and in New Jersey. Financial problems led to bankruptcy in 1975.<ref>"The Arnold Constable & Company Buildings" [http://blog.bryantpark.org/2013/05/from-archives-arnold-constable-company.html May 16, 2013]</ref>

In New York City in 1846, Alexander Turney Stewart established the "280 Broadway|Marble Palace" on Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway, between Chambers and Reade streets. He offered European retail merchandise at fixed prices on a variety of dry goods, and advertised a policy of providing "free entrance" to all potential customers. Though it was clad in white marble to look like a Renaissance palazzo, the building's cast iron construction permitted large plate glass windows that permitted major seasonal displays, especially in the Christmas shopping season. In 1862, Stewart built a new store on a full city block with eight floors and nineteen departments of dress goods and furnishing materials, carpets, glass and china, toys and sports equipment, ranged around a central glass-covered court. His innovations included buying from manufacturers for cash and in large quantities, keeping his markup small and prices low, truthful presentation of merchandise, the one-price policy (so there was no haggling), simple merchandise returns and cash refund policy, selling for cash and not credit, buyers who searched worldwide for quality merchandise, departmentalization, vertical and horizontal integration, volume sales, and free services for customers such as waiting rooms and free delivery of purchases. His innovations were quickly copied by other department stores.<ref>Harry E. Resseguie, "Alexander Turney Stewart and the Development of the Department Store, 1823–1876," ''Business History Review'' (1965) 39#3 pp. 301–322 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3112143 in JSTOR]</ref>

In 1858, Rowland Hussey Macy founded Macy's as a dry goods store. Benjamin Altman and Lord & Taylor soon competed with Stewart as New York's earliest department stores, later followed by "McCreary's" and, in Brooklyn, "Abraham & Straus." (The Straus family would be in the management of both Macy's and A&S.)

By the 1880s New York's retail center had moved uptown, forming a stretch of retail shopping from "Marble Palace" that was called the "Ladies' Mile". By 1894, the major stores competed in the Christmas season with elaborate Christmas window displays; in 1895 Macy's featured 13 tableaux, including scenes from "Jack and the Beanstalk", ''Gulliver's Travels'' and other children's favorites.<ref>cite book|author=Laura Byrne Paquet|title=The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwJ4ds4fkMAC&pg=PA191|year=2003|publisher=ECW Press|page=191</ref>

Philadelphia
In 1877, John Wanamaker opened the United States' first modern department store in a former Pennsylvania Railroad freight terminal in Philadelphia. Wanamakers was the first department store to offer fixed prices marked on every article and also introduced electrical illumination (1878), the telephone (1879), and the use of pneumatic tubes to transport cash and documents (1880) to the department store business.<ref>Robert Sobel, ''The Entrepreneurs: Explorations Within the American Business Tradition'' (1974), chapter 3, "John Wanamaker: The Triumph of Content Over Form"</ref> Subsequent department stores founded in Philadelphia included Strawbridge and Clothier, Gimbels, Lit Brothers, and N.

The company was the first to introduce the concept of the personal shopper, and that service was provided without charge in every Field's store, until the chain's last days under the Marshall Field's name.

Moreover, every year at Christmas, Marshall Field's downtown store windows were filled with animated displays as part of the downtown shopping district display; the "theme" window displays became famous for their ingenuity and beauty, and visiting the Marshall Field's windows at Christmas became a tradition for Chicagoans and visitors alike, as popular a local practice as visiting the Walnut Room with its equally famous Christmas tree or meeting "under the clock" on State Street.<ref>Wendt and Kogan, ''Give the Lady What She Wants: The Story of Marshall Field & Company'' (1952)</ref>

The Carson Pirie Scott brand is strongly associated with the historic Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building designed by Louis Sullivan. It was built in 1899 for the retail firm Schlesinger & Mayer, and expanded and sold to Carson Pirie Scott in 1904. The building, located on State Street in Chicago's Loop, housed the chain's flagship store for more than a century before closing for good in 2007.<ref>Joseph M.

In northern or isolated communities The North West Company (named after the historical North West Company fur trade company) operates smaller department stores.

Before the 1950s, the department store held an eminent place in both Canada and Australia, during both the Great Depression and World War II. Since then, they have suffered from strong competition from specialist stores. Most recently the competition has intensified with the advent of larger-scale superstores (Jones ''et al.'' 1994; Merrilees and Miller 1997). Competition was not the only reason for the department stores' weakening strength; the changing structure of cities also affected them. The compact and centralized 19th century city with its mass transit lines converging on the downtown was a perfect environment for department store growth. But as residents moved out of the downtown areas to the suburbs, the large, downtown department stores became inconvenient and lost business to the newer suburban shopping centres.  In 2003, U.S. department store sales were surpassed by big-box store sales for the first time<ref name="radioboston">cite news| title=Shopping at Downtown Crossing| url=http://radioboston.wbur.org/2009/05/15/downtown-crossing-development/|  author=Mark Navin| publisher=WBUR| date=14 August 2009| accessdate=2012-01-26</ref> (though some stores may be classified as "big box" by physical layout and "department store" by merchandise).

Please handle facts from that period separately from "Department Store in People's Republic of China", which is a country didn't come into existence until 1949, and had no control over Hong Kong until 1997. -->
The first department store, Lane Crawford, was opened in 1850<ref>cite web|url=http://www.lanecrawford.com/info/history.jsp|title=Lane Crawford|website=www.lanecrawford.com</ref> by Scots Thomas Ash Lane and Ninian Crawford on Des Voeux Road, Hong Kong Island. At the beginning, the store mainly catered to visiting ships' crews as well as British Navy staff and their families. In 1900, the first ethnic-Chinese owned Sincere Department Store was opened by Ma Ying Piu, who returned from Australia and inspired by David Jones Limited|David Jones. In 1907, another former Hong Kong expatriate in Australia, the Kwoks family, returned to Hong Kong and founded Wing On.

Since the 1960s, a number of Japanese owned department stores started to enter the Hong Kong market. Daimaru was opened in the corner of Great George Street, Hong Kong|Great George Street and Paterson Street in 1960, followed by Matsuzakaya, Isetan, Seibu Department Stores|Seibu, Sogo Hong Kong|Sogo and Yaohan. Yaohan was taken over by JUSCO in 1990s and later became Æon Group|Æon.

Magasin is by far the largest, with six stores all over the country, with the flagship store being Magasin du Nord on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen. Illum's only store on Amagertorv in Copenhagen has the appearance of a department store with 20% run by Magasin, but has individual shop owners making it a shopping centre. However, in people's minds, it remains a department store. Salling has two stores in Jutland with one of these being the reason for the closure of a Magasin store due to the competition.

=Germany=
The design and function of department stores in Germany followed the lead of London, Paris and New York.<ref name="Heidrun Homburg 1992 pp 183-219"/> Germany used to have a number of department store chains; now only a few of them remain. Next to some smaller, independent department stores these are Karstadt (in 2010 taken over by Nicolas Berggruen, also operating the KaDeWe in Berlin, the Alsterhaus in Hamburg and the Oberpollinger in Munich), Galeria Kaufhof (part of the Canadian Hudson Bay Company since 2017). Others like Hertie, Wertheim (department store)|Wertheim and Horten AG were taken over by others and either fully integrated or later closed.

Larger department stores in Germany usually contain a self-service restaurant, clothing departments, a toy department, a department for computer and electronics, a small book department (for bestsellers), a department for newspapers and magazines and a food department (like a supermarket).

One of the most famous department stores in Germany is the Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe, German for "department store of the west") which is located in Berlin.

=Indonesia=
Indonesia's largest department store chain is Ramayana(Departmental store chain)|Ramayana with over ninety branches across the country. The same group also operates under Robinson(not related to Robinsons (department store)|Robinsons and Co from Singapore and Central Department Store's Robinson from Thailand) and Cahaya, all targeting the lower income sectors. Other local department store positioned for lower-middle segment is Transmart Department Store owned by CT Corp and Matahari (department store)|Matahari Department Store owned by Lippo Group.

Lippo Group's Matahari previously managed to trade under Mega M, Galeria (department store)|Galeria, and Parisian (department store chain)|Parisian brands, all of which have been progressively closed. Lippo acquired Matahari Department Store from its founder Hari Darmawan in 1996, and sits as President Director of the company until 2001.<ref>https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/news/20180310165719-4-6844/antara-hari-darmawan-matahari-dan-lippo</ref> Lippo previously owned a franchise of Walmart (hypermarket) and J.C.

The department store itself has 24 branches nationwide as of 2017 and plans to expand as part of Transmart Carrefour's expansion plan.<ref>http://www.beritasatu.com/ekonomi/239379-2019-carrefour-ganti-nama-jadi-transmart.html</ref> The company also owned 50% ownership of Metro (department store)|Metro Department Store in Indonesia, targeting the middle-up segment with 10 branches nationwide. Metro entered Indonesia in 1991, opening its first store at Pondok Indah Mall. CT Corp's partnership with Metro starts when Metro opened its third store at Trans Studio Mall Bandung, previously known Bandung Supermall, before finally acquiring Metro Indonesia's 40% stake in 2008, and another 10% in 2010.<ref>http://www.metroholdings.com.sg/update2018/MHL%20Annual%20Report%202018.pdf</ref>

Another middle-up segment competitor besides Metro (department store)|Metro Department Store is Sogo Department Store from Japan, established in the 1990s at Plaza Indonesia and Mal Kelapa Gading before Plaza Indonesia branch's closure in 2007. The year 2007 also saw the re-opening of Jakarta's Seibu Department Stores|Seibu Department Store at  Jakarta shopping mall Grand Indonesia, poised to be the largest and second most upscale department store in Indonesia after Harvey Nichols; the latter closed in 2010 and plans to return. Other international department stores include Debenhams (closed in 2017) and Galeries Lafayette. The latter joined the Indonesian market in 2013 inside Pacific Place Mall, targeting the middle-up market with a price range from affordable to luxury, and is poised to be the largest upscale department store. Galeries Lafayette, Debenhams, Harvey Nichols, Seibu Department Stores|Seibu and Sogo are all operated by PT. Mitra Adiperkasa.

Central Group from Thailand entered Indonesia replacing Harvey Nichols at Grand Indonesia, bringing its flagship Central brand. Its entry gained success in the Indonesian market by bringing Thailand-based fashion and living brands. Parkson, Lotte Department Store|Lotte, and ÆON (company)|AEON also entered Indonesia in the 2010s.

Parkson acquired the local brand Centro Department Store in 2011. Centro still operates for middle market while the Parkson brand itself, positioned for middle-up segment, entered in 2014 by opening its first store in Medan, followed by its second and third store in Jakarta and Yogyakarta.<ref>http://www.centro.co.id/about-us/overview/</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.parkson.com.sg/milestones/|title=Milestones ‹ Parkson Retail Asia Limited|website=www.parkson.com.sg</ref> Lotte Department Store|Lotte, meanwhile, entered the market by inking a partnership with Ciputra Group, creating what is called 'Lotte Shopping Avenue' inside the Ciputra World Jakarta complex, as well as acquiring Makro and rebranding it into Lotte Mart for hypermarket business and Lotte Grosir (previously Lotte Mart Wholesale) for wholesale business. As of 2017, Lotte Department Store is not expanding despite the company plans to open 5 more stores.<ref>https://properti.kompas.com/read/2014/10/01/080040221/Lotte.Department.Store.Ekspansi.Lima.Cabang.Hingga.2018</ref>

Ireland developed a strong middle class, especially in the major cities, by the mid-nineteenth century.  They were active patrons of department stores.<ref>Stephanie Rains, ''Commodity Culture and Social Class in Dublin 1850–1916'' (2010)</ref> 
Clerys|Delany's New Mart was opened in 1853 in Dublin, Ireland. Unlike others, Delany's had not evolved gradually from a smaller shop on site. Thus it could claim to be the first purpose-built department store in the world. The term "department store" had not been invented at that time, so it was called the "Monster House". The store was completely destroyed in the 1916 Easter Rising, but reopened in 1922.<ref>cite book|author=Stephanie Rains|title=Commodity Culture and Social Class in Dublin 1850–1916|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73YpAQAAMAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Irish Academic Press|page=14</ref>

Arnotts (Ireland)|Arnotts is one of the largest stores in Ireland. However, several large retailers now own chains of department stores, such as:
* Brown Thomas
* Debenhams
* Dunnes Stores
* Marks & Spencer

The most upmarket chain is undoubtedly Brown Thomas (known colloquially as BT), founded as a haberdasher's in 1849 on Dublin's Grafton Street. The company (which belongs to the same group as the UK's Selfridges or Canada's Holt Renfrew) bought its long-time competitor across the street, Switzers, from House of Fraser group in 1995. BT then moved to the larger site. It also acquired and re-branded the former Switzer stores in Cork (formerly Cash's), Limerick (formerly Todd's) and Galway (formerly Moon's).<ref>Edmund O'Callaghan et al. edfs. ''Retailing in Ireland: Contemporary Perspectives'' (2012)</ref>

The British department store, Debenhams, purchased the Roches Stores chain in 2006, closed two stores and rebranded the others. The opening of Dundrum Town Centre in Dublin's suburbs saw the arrival of two more British stores, House of Fraser and Harvey Nichols.  The Woolworth chain store had major presence from the early twentieth century until 1984, when its stores throughout the Republic of Ireland closed their doors for the last time.<ref>Barbara Walsh,  "Chain store retailing in Ireland: a case study of FW Woolworth & Co.

=Philippines=

The first department store in the Philippines is the Hoskyn's Department Store of Hoskyn & Co. established in 1877 in Iloilo by the Englishman Henry Hoskyn, nephew of Nicholas Loney, the first British vice-consul in Iloilo.<ref>http://www.iloilo.gov.ph/for-visitors/tourism/iloilos-firsts</ref>  Some of the earliest department stores in the Philippines were located in Manila as early as 1898 with the opening of the American Bazaar, which was later named Beck's. During the course of the History of the Philippines (1898-1946)|American occupation of the Philippines, many department stores were built throughout the city, many of which were located in Escolta.

Currently Portugal has only two department stores, both operated by El Corte Inglés, one in Lisbon Metropolitan Area, other in Porto Metropolitan Area. This small number of department stores can be explained by the widespread presence throughout the country of shopping centres and supermarket chains like Continente, owned by Sonae, Intermarché and Pingo Doce, owned by Jerónimo Martins, which are more akin to the local taste.

=Puerto Rico=
In Puerto Rico, various department stores have operated, such as Sears, JC Penney, Macy's, Kmart, Wal-Mart, Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory, T.J. Maxx, Costco, Sam's Club and others.

The site where the Saint Petersburg Passage (department store)|Passage sprawls had been devoted to trade since the city's foundation in the early 18th century. It had been occupied by various shops and warehouses (Maly Gostiny Dvor, Schukin Dvor, Apraksin Dvor) until 1846, when Count Essen-Stenbock-Fermor acquired the grounds to build an elite shopping centre for the Russian nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie. Stenbock-Fermor conceived of the Passage as more than a mere shopping centre, but also as a cultural and social centre for the people of St Petersburg. The edifice contained coffee-houses, confectioneries, panorama installations, an anatomical museum, a wax museum, and even a small zoo, described by Dostoyevsky in his extravaganza "The Crocodile (short story)|Crocodile, or Passage through the Passage". The concert hall became renowned as a setting for literary readings attended by the likes of Dostoevsky and Turgenev. Parenthetically, the Passage premises have long been associated with the entertainment industry and still remains home to the Komissarzhevskaya Theatre.

Socialism confronted consumerism in the chain GUM (department store)|State Department Stores (GUM), set up by Lenin in 1921 as a model retail enterprise. It operated stores throughout Russia and targeted consumers across class, gender, and ethnic lines. GUM was designed to advance the Bolsheviks' goals of eliminating private enterprise and rebuilding consumerism along socialist lines, as well as democratizing consumption for workers and peasants nationwide. GUM became a major propaganda purveyor, with advertising and promotional campaigns that taught Russians the goals of the regime and attempted to inculcate new attitudes and behavior. In trying to create a socialist consumer culture from scratch, GUM recast the functions and meanings of buying and selling, turning them into politically charged acts that could either contribute to or delay the march toward utopian communism. By the late 1920s, however, GUM's grandiose goals had proven unrealistic and largely alienated consumers, who instead learned a culture of complaint and entitlement. GUM's main function became one of distributing whatever the factories sent them, regardless of consumer demand or quality.<ref>Marjorie L. Hilton, "Retailing the Revolution: The State Department Store (GUM) and Soviet Society in the 1920s," ''Journal of Social History'' (2004) 37#4 pp. 939–964 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790073 in JSTOR]</ref>

In the 21st century the most famous department store in Russia is GUM in Moscow, followed by Muir & Mirrielees|TsUM and the Petrovsky Passage. Other popular stores are Mega (shopping centres), Stockmann, and Marks & Spencer. Media Markt, M-video, Technosila, and White Wind (Beliy Veter) sell a large number of electronic devices. In St. Petersburg, Passage (department store)|the Passage has been popular since the 1840s. The 1956 Soviet film ''Behind Store Window'' depicts the operation of a Moscow department store in the 1950s.citation needed|date=August 2017

=Singapore=

File:Shinsegae Department Store in Seoul.jpg|thumb|Shinsegae Department Store in Seoul
Concept of department store introduced during Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese forced occupation. ''Hwashin Sanghoe'' (literally “Hwashin Store”) in downtown Seoul was considered as first department store in Korea. Mitsukoshi opened Seoul branch in 1930 as Keijo Mitsukoshi(京城三越). After the liberation of Korea, Japanese-owned department stores became government corporation. For example, Mitsukoshi became ''Dongwha'' and acquired by Samsung Group|Samsung in 1963, and Choujiya became ''Midopa'' then acquired by Lotte Group|Lotte in late 1990s.

The five most prevalent chains are Lotte Department Store|Lotte, Hyundai Department Store|Hyundai, Shinsegae, Galleria Department Store|Galleria, and AK Plaza.
Lotte Department Store is the largest, operating more than 60 stores (including Lotte Outlets, Young Plazas, and foreign branches). Hyundai Department Store has about 19 stores (15 department, 4 outlet), and there are 13 stores in Shinsegae. Shinsegae has three outlet stores with Simon. Galleria has five, and AK has five stores. These five department stores are known as giant retailers in South Korea. From fashion items to electric appliances, people can buy various kinds of products. Every weekend, people are fond of going around these department stores, because their locations are usually easy to visit.

As of 2010 the Shinsegae department store in Centum City, Busan, is the largest department store in the world.<ref>Kerrie L.

=Spain=
The first department store in Spain was Almacenes el Siglo, opened in October 1881 in Barcelona. Following the 2002 closure by the Australian group Partridges of their SEPU (Sociedad Española de Precios Unicos) department store chain, which was one of Spain's oldest, the market is now dominated by El Corte Inglés, founded in 1934 as a drapery store. El Corte Inglés stores tend to be vast buildings, selling a very broad range of product. The group also controls a number of other retail formats, including the supermarket chain Supercor and hypermarket chain Hipercor. It currently employs 91,000 people and is the largest department store in Europe, with department stores all over mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands and Portugal. Its first store opened in Madrid, where it currently has its headquarters. As of 2016, there were 95 El Corte Inglés department stores.

Other competitors such as Simago and Galerías Preciados closed in the 1990s. However, El Corte Inglés faces major competition from French discount operators such as Carrefour and Auchan.<ref>Peter Gold and Lucy Woodliffe, "Department Stores in Spain: Why El Corte Ingles

Most of the early department stores in London started out as small drapery shops which bought up neighbouring shops and increased their range of products.

* Allders of Croydon, founded in 1862 by Joshua Allder, was the flagship of a large chain of department stores in the UK. The chain went into administration in 2005. The Croydon store was taken over by Harold Tillman of Jaeger (clothing)|Jaeger trading as Allders but went into administration in June 2012.

John Lewis Newcastle (formerly Bainbridge) in Newcastle upon Tyne is the world's oldest department store. It is still known to many of its customers as Bainbridge, despite the name change to 'John Lewis'. The Newcastle institution dates back to 1838 when Emerson Muschamp Bainbridge, aged 21, went into partnership with William Alder Dunn and opened a draper's and fashion in Market Street, Newcastle. In terms of retailing history, one of the most significant facts about the Newcastle Bainbridge shop is that as early as 1849 weekly takings were recorded by department, making it the earliest of all department stores. This ledger survives and is kept in the John Lewis archives. John Lewis bought the Bainbridge store in 1952.

John Lewis Newcastle retained its original name of Bainbridge until 2002, when the store was rebranded as John Lewis Newcastle.

Also, Kendals in Manchester can lay claim to being one of the oldest department stores in the UK. Beginning as a small shop owned by S. and J. Watts in 1796, its sold a variety of goods. Kendal Milne and Faulkner purchased the business in 1835. Expanding the space, rather than using it as a typical warehouse simply to showcase textiles, it became a vast bazaar. Serving Manchester's upmarket clientele for over 200 years, it was taken over by House of Fraser and recently rebranded as House of Fraser Manchester – although most Mancunians still refer to it as Kendals. The Kendal Milne signage still remains over the main entrance to the art deco building in the city's Deansgate.

In Edinburgh, Jenners saw a similar development. It started as a drapery shop in 1838. By 1890 it had grown into Scotland's largest retail shop by gobbling up all of the small shops in the neighbourhood. In 1895, after a devastating fire, a new ultra-modern building opened, with lavish electrical lighting, hydraulic lifts and air conditioning. Four hours after the grand opening, 25,000 people had already visited the store.

In the UK the term "department store" still refers to the traditional, classic department store, which has a wide range of independent departments with their own staff and their own Cash register|tills. Large discount shops with the tills located by the entrance are not regarded as department stores in the UK, although the owners may call them that. Shops such as Marks & Spencer, Britain's largest clothes retailer, would therefore not be included in the British definition of a department store.

=United States=
Historian William H. Young emphasizes the impressive architecture of the department stores, which dominated the downtown retail shopping district:
:Architecturally, these multifloored "palaces of consumption" often featured ornate cast-iron facades with vast, open interiors. At times they boasted fanciful domes and skylights that flooded the interiors with natural light in the days before electrification. Plate-glass windows on the street level allowed elaborate displays of the treasures within, thus making "window shopping" a new urban leisure activity. Since the store itself was palatial, this focus on display created an atmosphere. It produced the proper environment for purveying goods that were seen as marks of achievement instead of necessities. Everything was ready-made; rather than bolts of cloth, here were racks of dresses. These were items for instant use, for immediate gratification.<ref>William H. Young, "Department Store" in ''Encyclopedia of American Studies'' (2015) [http://eas-ref.press.jhu.edu/view?aid=149 online]</ref>

Chains and variety stores
Chain department stores grew rapidly after 1920, and provided competition for the downtown upscale department stores, as well as local department stores in small cities. J. C. Penney had four stores in 1908, 312 in 1920, and 1452 in 1930. Sears|Sears, Roebuck & Company, a giant mail-order house, opened its first eight retail stores in 1925, and operated 338 by 1930, and 595 by 1940.<ref>Godfrey M. Lebhar, ''Chain Stores in America: 1859–1959 (1959), pp 16, 46</ref>  The chains reached a middle-class audience, that was more interested in value than in upscale fashions.  Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It deemphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability, and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Its stores were oriented to motorists – set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, "windowless" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns.<ref>Richard Longstreth, "Sears, Roebuck and the Remaking of the Department Store, 1924–42," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' (2006) 65#2 pp 238–279</ref>

An even more popular level, were the Variety stores, especially the dime stores, led by Woolworth, Kresge, and Kress. They operated over 4,200 stores in 1930.  By the 21st century, the dime store disappeared and the niche of low-cost, high turnover merchandise was taken over by the dollar stores.<ref>Lebhar, ''Chain Stores in America: 1859–1959 (1959),  p. 53</ref>

The 2000s have seen a worldwide decline with the rise of e-commerce. The number of companies operating department stores dropped from 95 (operating 9,969 stores) in 2006 to 68 (operating 9,456 stores) in 2013.<ref>http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/2013120/BUSINESS/310200023/?odyssey=nav%7Chead</ref>

Segmentation

Department stores tend to target different socio-economic and geographic segments:

* Luxury: Barneys New York, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman
* Upscale: Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom, Von Maur, Lord & Taylor
* Middle and middle-up-market: Dillard's, Macy's 
* Regional: Belk, Boscov's
* Downscale: J. C. Penney, Kohl's, Sears
* Discount stores: Kmart, Meijer, Target Corporation|Target, Walmart
* Off-price retailers: Burlington Coat Factory, Marshalls, Ross Dress for Less, and T.J. Maxx are stores that sell designer goods at lower prices, often on a surplus basis.

Stores that carry a general line (merchandise)|general line of groceries and other product lines similar to those of department stores are considered warehouse clubs or supercenters. Warehouse clubs require a nominal annual membership fee, while supercenters do not. Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Sam's Club are examples of warehouse clubs.

Salt Lake City
On 1 March 1869, Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution opened in Salt Lake City as a new community store that became the first incorporated department store in America in 1870. A new 3-story brick and iron store was built in 1876, noted for its unique architecture and striped awnings.  This store was replaced by an enclosed shopping center in 1973, and the new Zion department store preserved the gilt-edged ornate facade of the old structure.<ref>Martha Sonntag Bradley, ''ZCMI, America's first department store'' (1991)</ref>

In 1999, the May Department Stores bought a 14-store ZCMI chain and rebranded it as "Meier & Frank", a May property with eight stores in Oregon and Washington (state)|Washington. Subsequently, May Department Stores completed a merger with Federated Department Stores and the Meier & Frank brand ZCMI stores became Macy's stores, effective late 2006.

The original facade of the ZCMI store was again preserved during the late 2000s construction of city creek center. The original plans removed the facade however public outcry persuaded the retaining of the beautiful historic architecture. The facade can still be seen from the TRAX station that runs between the new complex.

Detroit
File:JLHudsonsPostcard.jpg|thumb|left|Hudson department store in Detroit in 1951; it opened in 1911, closed in 1986 and was torn down in 1998

In 1881, Joseph Lowthian Hudson opened a small men's clothing store in Detroit. After 10 years he had eight stores in the midwest and was the most profitable clothing retailer in the country.  In 1893, he began construction of J. L. Hudson Department Store at Gratiot and Farmer Streets in Detroit. The store grew over the years and a 25-story tower was added in 1928.  The final section was a 12-story addition in 1946, giving the entire complex convert|49|acre|ha of floor space.<ref>Michael Hauser and Marianne Weldon, ''Hudson's: Detroit's Legendary Department Store'' (Arcadia 2004).</ref>

After World War II Hudson's realized that the limited parking space at its downtown skyscraper would increasingly be a problem for its customers.  The solution in 1954 was to open the Northland Center in nearby Southfield, just beyond the city limits.  It was the largest suburban shopping center in the world, and quickly became the main shopping destination for northern and western Detroit, and for much of the suburbs.  By 1961 the downtown skyscraper accounted for only half of Hudson's sales; it closed in 1983.<ref>Robert Conot, ''American Odyssey'' (1974) p 401</ref> The Northland Center Hudson's, rebranded Macy's in 2006 following acquisition by Federated Department Stores, was closed along with the remaining stores in the center in March 2015 due to the center's high storefront vacancy, decaying infrastructure, and financial mismanagement.<ref>cite web|last1=Reindl|first1=J.C.|title=Time running out for Northland Center |url=http://www.freep.com/story/money/business/michigan/2015/03/19/last-call-northland-center-mall/24991899/|website=freep.com|publisher=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=2 April 2015</ref>

Minneapolis
George Dayton had founded his Dayton's Dry Goods store in Minneapolis in 1902 and the AMC cooperative in 1912.  His descendants built Southdale Center in 1956, opened the Target Corporation|Target discount store chain in 1962 and the B. Dalton Bookseller chain in 1966. Dayton's grew to 19 stores under the Dayton's name plus five other regional names acquired by Dayton-Hudson. The Dayton-Hudson Corporation closed the flagship J. L. Hudson Department Store in downtown Detroit in 1983, but expanded its other retail operations. It acquired Mervyn's in 1978, Marshall Field's in 1990, and renamed itself the Target Corporation in 2000. In 2002, Dayton's and Hudson's were consolidated into the Marshall Field's name.  In 2005, May Department Stores acquired all of the Marshall Field's stores and shortly thereafter, Macy's acquired May.<ref>Kristal Leebrick, ''Dayton's: A Twin Cities Institution'' (The History Press, 2013).

Pittsburgh
In 1849, Horne's began operations and soon became a leading Pittsburgh department store. In 1879, it opened a seven-story landmark which was the first department store in the city's downtown.  In 1972, Associated Dry Goods acquired Horne's, and ADG expanded operations of Horne's to several stores in suburban centers throughout the Pittsburgh region as well as in Erie, Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio. In December 1986, Horne's was acquired by a local investor group following ADG's acquisition by May Department Stores. By 1994, Federated Department Stores acquired the remaining ten Horne's stores and merged them with its Lazarus division, completely ceasing all operations of any store under the Horne's name.

Kaufmann's was founded in Pittsburgh in 1871 by Jacob and Isaac Kaufmann. In 1877, the brothers moved downtown to a location that became known as ''The Big Store''.<ref name="continue">cite news| title=Macy's to continue Christmas-shopping extravaganza| url= http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/rss/s_478460.html| author=William Loeffler| work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review| publisher=Pittsburgh Live| date=7 November 2006| accessdate=2012-01-26</ref> "The Big Store" featured a large landmark outdoor clock that became a popular meeting place and city icon.
