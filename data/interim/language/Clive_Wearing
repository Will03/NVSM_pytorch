Clive Wearing (born 11 May 1938) is a British former musicologist, conductor, tenor and keyboardist who suffers from chronic anterograde amnesia|anterograde and retrograde amnesia. He lacks the ability to form new memories, and also cannot recall aspects of his past memories, frequently believing that he has only recently awoken from a comatose state.

Musical career
Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician, and is known for editing the works of Orlande de Lassus. Wearing sang at Westminster Cathedral as a tenor lay clerk for many years and also had a successful career as a chorus master and worked as such at Covent Garden and with the London Sinfonietta Chorus.

In 1968, he founded the Europa Singers of London, an amateur choir specialising in music of the 17th, 18th, and 20th centuries. It won critical approval especially for performances of the Vespro della Beata Vergine 1610|Monteverdi Vespers. In 1977, it gave the first performance in the Russian Cathedral of Sir John Tavener's setting of the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom with Roderick Earle as bass soloist, and subsequently made a recording (Ikon Records No. 9007). The Europa Singers also competed in the XXXII Concorso Polifonico Internazionale in Arezzo in 1984, and provided choruses for operas staged by the London Opera Centre, including Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully's Alceste (Lully)|Alceste and Mozart's Marriage of Figaro, which was performed at Sadler's Wells Opera|Sadler's Wells.

Wearing also organised The London Lassus Ensemble, designing and staging the 1982 London Lassus Festival to commemorate the composer's 450th Anniversary.

Whilst working at the BBC, Wearing was made responsible for the musical content of BBC Radio 3 for much of 29 July 1981, the day of the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer. For that occasion, he chose to recreate, with authentic instruments and meticulously researched scores, the Bavarian royal wedding which took place in Munich on 22 February 1568. The music by Lassus, Padovano, de'Bardi, Palestrina, Gabrieli, Tallis, etc., was performed by the Taverner Consort, Choir and Players, and the Natural Trumpet Ensemble of the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, conducted by Andrew Parrott.

Amnesia
On 27 March 1985, Wearing, then an acknowledged expert in early music at the height of his career with BBC Radio 3, contracted herpesviral encephalitis, a herpes simplex virus that attacked his central nervous system.<ref>cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3313452/The-man-who-keeps-falling-in-love-with-his-wife.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Deborah | last=Wearing | title=The man who keeps falling in love with his wife | date=12 January 2005</ref> Since this point, he has been unable to store new memories. He has also been unable to control his emotions (unstable mood) and to associate memories effectively.

Wearing developed a profound case of total amnesia as a result of his illness. Because of damage to the hippocampus, an area required to transfer memories from Short-term memory|short-term to long-term memory, he is completely unable to form lasting new memories – his memory only lasts between 7 and 30 seconds.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/vod/vod_window.html?pid=1618|title=Video on Demand - The Mind: Teaching Modules - Clive Wearing, Part 2: Living Without Memory|website=www.learner.org|access-date=2018-05-22</ref> He spends every day "waking up" every 20 seconds, "restarting" his consciousness once the time span of his short term memory elapses (about 30 seconds). During this time, he repeatedly questions why he has not seen a doctor, as he constantly believes he has only recently awoken from a comatose state. If engaged in discussion, Clive is able to provide answers to questions, but cannot stay in the flow of conversation for longer than a few sentences. If asked about his current situation, he becomes very angry and upset, as he cannot obtain an explanation for his condition and thus feels interrogated. He remembers little of his life before 1985; he knows, for example, that he has children from an earlier marriage, but cannot remember their names. His love for his second wife Deborah, whom he married the year prior to his illness, is undiminished. He greets her joyously every time they meet, either believing he has not seen her in years or that they have never met before, even though she may have just left the room momentarily. When he goes out dining with his wife, he can remember the name of the food (e.g. chicken); however he cannot link it with taste, as he forgets what food he is eating by the time it has reached his mouth.<ref>BBC</ref>

In a diary provided by his caretakers, Wearing was encouraged to record his thoughts.  Page after page is filled with entries similar to the following:
<blockquote>
 <del>8:31 AM: Now I am really, completely awake.</del><br />
 <del>9:06 AM: Now I am perfectly, overwhelmingly awake.</del><br />
 9:34 AM: Now I am superlatively, actually awake.
</blockquote>
Earlier entries are usually crossed out, since he forgets having made an entry within minutes and dismisses the writings–he does not know how the entries were made or by whom, although he does recognise his own writing.<ref name="video">''The Mind'', BBC series, Part 1</ref> Wishing to record "waking up for the first time", he still wrote diary entries in 2007, more than two decades after he started them.

Wearing can learn new practices and even a very few facts—not from episodic memory or Encoding (memory)|encoding, but by acquiring new procedural memory|procedural memories through repetition.  For example, having watched a certain video recording multiple times on successive days, he never had any memory of ever seeing the video or knowing the contents, but he was able to anticipate certain parts of the content without remembering how he learned them.<ref name="video2">''The Mind'', BBC series, Part 2</ref>

Reports
Wearing's wife Deborah has written a book about her husband's case entitled ''Forever Today''.<ref>cite book |last=Wearing |first=Deborah |title=Forever today: a memoir of love and amnesia |publisher=Corgi |year=2005 |isbn=0-552-77169-4</ref>

His story was told in a 1986 documentary entitled ''Equinox: Prisoner of Consciousness'', in which he was interviewed by Jonathan Miller. An updated story was told in the 2005 ITV Network|ITV documentary ''The Man with the 7 Second Memory'' (although Wearing's short term memory span can be up to 30 seconds).

He was also featured in the 1988 PBS series, ''The Mind'', in Episode 1, ''In Search of the Mind.''

He also appears in the 2006 documentary series ''Time (2006 TV series)|Time'', where his case is used to illustrate the effect of losing one's perception of time.

His story was also told in episode No. 304 – "Memory and Forgetting" on the show ''Radio Lab'' on New York Public Radio, WNYC.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org|title=Radiolab ! WNYC Studios ! Podcasts|website=wnycstudios|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22</ref>
