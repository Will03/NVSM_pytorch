Foreign language anxiety is a form of what psychologists describe as a ''specific anxiety reaction''.<ref name="Horwitz 125–132">Cite journal|last=Horwitz|first=Elaine K.|last2=Horwitz|first2=Michael B.|last3=Cope|first3=Joann|date=1986-06-01|title=Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety|journal=The Modern Language Journal|language=en|volume=70|issue=2|pages=125–132|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.1986.tb05256.x|issn=1540-4781</ref> Some individuals are more predisposed to anxiety than others and may feel anxious in a wide variety of situations. Foreign language anxiety, however, is situation-specific and so it can also affect individuals who are not characteristically anxious in other situations.

Although all aspects of using and learning a foreign language can cause anxiety, both listening and speaking are regularly cited as the most anxiety provoking of foreign language activities.<ref name="MacIntyre" /><ref name="Horwitz">cite journal |last=Horwirz |first=E.

It has been argued that language learning is a "profoundly unsettling psychological proposition"<ref name="Horwitz 125–132"/> as it jeopardizes an individual's self-understanding and perspective.<ref name="Horwitz 125–132"/> Three theories of anxiety have been developed from internal appraisal, then more situational in learning language and contextual situationclarify|date=July 2017:<ref name=":0" />

Potential negative events that people cannot see or handle with their abilityclarify|date=July 2017 often leads to anxiety. Also, if individuals are highly anxious, that kind of habitualised reactionsclarify|date=July 2017 may cause those who have experienced many threatening situations in the past to be more likely perceive future situations as threatening. As well, if their anxiety are traits rather than states, self-efficacy must result from past successes, vicarious experiences and social persuasion.<ref name=":0">cite journal|last1=Pappamihiel|first1=N. Eleni|title=English as a Second Language Students and English Language Anxiety: Issues in the Mainstream Classroom|journal=Research in the Teaching of English|date=1 January 2002|volume=36|issue=3|pages=327–355|jstor=40171530</ref>

''Self-efficacy'' is one's own confidence that he or she would be able to handle to achieve intended goals. ''State, trait, situational anxiety'' refers to those who have gotten traumatised a lot in the past being more likely to perceive the future situations as treating too. Also, specifically in an ESL classroom, students learning a foreign language out of their country are very vulnerable to high levels of anxiety about language learning, which leads them to being less likely to get encouraged by others because of lacking vicarious experience and social persuasions.<ref name=":0" />

More specifically, foreign language anxiety is seen in a language classroom. As such, the causes of foreign language anxiety have been broadly separated into three main components: communication apprehension, test anxiety and fear of negative evaluation.<ref name="Horwitz" /> Communication apprehension is the anxiety experienced in speaking or listening to other individuals. Test-anxiety is a form of performance anxiety associated with the fear of doing badly or failing altogether. Fear of negative evaluation is the anxiety associated with the learner's perception of how other onlookers (instructors, classmates or others) may negatively view their language ability.

If a student is unable to study as required before writing a language examination, the student could experience test anxiety. Context anxiety could be viewed as a result. In contrast, anxiety becomes a cause of poor language learning when it was due to anxiety that student is unable to adequately learn the target language.

There can be various physical causes of anxiety, such as hormone levels, but the underlying causes of excessive anxiety while learning are fear<ref>cite journal|last1=Shahsavari|first1=Mahmood|title=Relationship between anxiety and achievement motivation among male and female students|journal=Journal of American Science|date=2012|volume=8|issue=11|pages=329–332|url=http://www.jofamericanscience.org/journals/am-sci/am0811/048_11656am0811_329_332.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2017|issn=2375-7264<!-- print: 1545-1003 --></ref> and a lack of confidence. Lack of confidence itself can come from various causes. One reason can be the teaching approach<ref>cite journal|last1=Riasati|first1=Mohammad Javad|title=Language Learning Anxiety from EFL Learners' Perspective|journal=Middle-East Journal of Scientific Research|date=2011|volume=7|issue=6|pages=907–914|url=http://idosi.org/mejsr/mejsr7(6)11/13.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826001617/http://idosi.org/mejsr/mejsr7(6)11/13.pdf|archive-date=26 August 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=23 January 2017|issn=1990-9233</ref> used.

Furthermore, foreign language anxiety roots in three psychological challenges:
* performance difficulty
* threat
* identity conflict
Those psychological states thus have task-performance and identity dimensions. People tend to act or speak in a way that would be judged appropriate to the other people native to the foreign culture, but the behaviour that individuals are producing grapples with ingrained values and behaviours. Emotions by the psychological challenges has something to do with attempting to switch codes in an interactive encounter.<ref name=":1">cite journal|last1=Molinsky|first1=Andrew|title=Cross-Cultural Code-Switching: The Psychological Challenges of Adapting Behavior in Foreign Cultural Interactions|journal=The Academy of Management Review|date=1 January 2007|volume=32|issue=2|pages=622–640|doi=10.2307/20159318|jstor=20159318</ref>

Effects
The effects of foreign language anxiety are particularly evident in the foreign language classroom, and anxiety is a strong indicator of academic performance. Anxiety is found to have a detrimental effect on students' confidence, self-esteem and level of participation.<ref name="Horwitz" />

Anxious learners suffer detrimental effects during spontaneous speaking activities in performance, affective reactions and their overall attitudes towards learning their target second language<ref name="Phillips">cite journal |last=Phillips |first=E. M. |year=1992 |title=The effects of language anxiety on students' oral test performance and attitudes |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=76 |issue= 1|pages=14–26 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.1992.tb02573.x</ref>. Furthermore, they may lack confidence, be less able to self-edit and identify language errors and more likely to employ avoidance coping|avoidance strategies such as skipping class.<ref name="Gregerson">cite journal |last=Gregerson |first=T. |year=2003 |title=To err is human: A reminder to teachers of language-anxious students |journal=Foreign Language Annals |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=25–32 |doi= 10.1111/j.1944-9720.2003.tb01929.x</ref> Anxious students also forget previously learned material, volunteer answers less frequently and tend to be more passive in classroom activities than their less anxious counterparts.<ref name="Horwitz" /><ref name="Ely">cite journal |last=Ely |first=C. M. |year=1986 |title=An analysis of discomfort, risk-taking, sociability, and motivation in the L2 classroom |journal=Language Learning |volume=36 |issue= |pages=1–25 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-1770.1986.tb00366.x</ref>

The effects of foreign language anxiety also extend outside the second language classroom. A high level of foreign language anxiety may also correspond with communication apprehension, causing individuals to be quieter and less willing to communicate.<ref>cite journal |last=Liu |first=M. |last2=Jackson |first2=J. |year=2008 |title=An exploration of Chinese EFL learners' Unwillingness to Communicate and Foreign Language Anxiety |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=92 |issue=i |pages=71–86 |doi= 10.1111/j.1540-4781.2008.00687.x</ref> People who exhibit this kind of communication reticence can also sometimes be perceived as less trustworthy, less competent, less socially and physically attractive, tenser, less composed and less dominant than their less reticent counterparts.

= Cross-cultural code-switching =
The effects of these negative emotions may also lead to cross-cultural code-switching, in which bilingual people alter a language to their other languageclarify|date=July 2017 through their interactions with other bilinguals. Unlike linguistic code-switching, cross-cultural code-switching is the socio-linguistic phenomenon of changing culturally-ingrained behaviors in a foreign situation.<ref name=":1" /> Although cross-cultural code-switching possibly results from both positive and negative emotions, negative emotions are more common and more likely to affect the way a bilingual person speaks. Negative emotions include embarrassment, performance anxiety, guilt, distress and anxiety.<ref name=":1" /><ref>Cite journal|last=Molinsky|first=Andrew|date=2007-01-01|title=Cross-Cultural Code-Switching: The Psychological Challenges of Adapting Behavior in Foreign Cultural Interactions|jstor=20159318|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=32|issue=2|pages=622–640|doi=10.2307/20159318</ref> "Molinsky identifies three psychological states that appraise under the influence of emotions while code-switching. These are: "experienced performance difficulty, face threat and identity conflict—all of which mediate the relationship between personal and contextual variables and the negative and positive emotions an individual experiences while code-switching".<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.diplom.de/document/228636|title=Diplom.de - Cross-cultural Code Switching and Application|website=www.diplom.de|language=de|access-date=2017-10-26</ref>

There are three types of cross-cultural code-switching:<ref name=":2">Cite journal|last=Titone|first=Renzo|date=1994-01-01|title=Some Italian Investigations of 'Code Switching' in Diglossic Settings: A Summary Report|jstor=30249052|journal=La Linguistique|volume=30|issue=2|pages=67–73</ref>
* situational code-switching
* conversational code-switching
* borrowing
This code-switching could be considered as an unconscious behavior because of its negative and usually threatening situations.clarify|date=July 2017 In that sense, although code-switching results from foreign language anxiety, it is more often caused by external circumstances than by internal mental change.clarify|date=July 2017<ref name=":2" />

Measures
A number of tools have been developed to investigate the level of foreign language anxiety experienced by language learners.

The Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS)<ref name="Horwitz" /> is a 33-question, 5-point Likert scale survey, which is widely used in research studies. It investigates participants' communication apprehension, test-anxiety and fear of negative evaluation and focuses on speaking in a classroom context. It has been translated and used in several languages, including Spanish language|Spanish and Chinese language|Chinese.

Following the success of the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety scale, similar instruments have been devised for measuring Foreign Language Reading Anxiety (FLRAS),<ref>cite journal |last=Saito |first=Y. |last2=Horwitz |first2=E. K. |last3=Garza |first3=T. J. |year=1999 |title=Foreign Language Reading Anxiety |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=83 |issue= 2|pages=202–218 |doi= 10.1111/0026-7902.00016</ref> Foreign Language Listening Anxiety (FLLAS) and Second Language Writing Apprehension (SLWAT).<ref>cite journal |last=Cheng |first=Y.

 Issues and area of research 
In the 1990s, the challenge was a clear categorisation of grammatical or sociolinguistic constraints on code-switching caused by foreign language anxiety and to determine how bilinguals produce different code-mixed patterns. In fact, previously, most researches focused more upon syntactic aspects on code-switching; in other words, psychological elements were completely ignored.<ref>cite journal|last1=Myers-Scotton|first1=Carol|title=Common and Uncommon Ground: Social and Structural Factors in Codeswitching|journal=Language in Society|date=1 January 1993|volume=22|issue=4|pages=475–503|jstor=4168471|doi=10.1017/s0047404500017449</ref>
