History
In the United States, the Texas chuckwagon is a precursor to the American food truck. In the later 1800s, herding cattle from the Southwest to markets in the North and East kept cowhands on the trail for months at a time.<ref>cite web|last=Thompson|first=Bill|title=American Chuck Wagon Association|url=http://americanchuckwagon.org/chuck-wagon-history.html|accessdate=2014-10-30</ref> In 1866, the "father of the Texas Panhandle", Charles Goodnight,<ref>In the Driftway.

Food consisted of dried beans, coffee, cornmeal, greasy cloth-wrapped bacon, salt pork, beef, usually dried or salted or smoked, and other easy to preserve food stuffs. The wagon was also stocked with a water barrel and a sling to kindle wood to heat and cook food.<ref>Sharpe, P. (1996). Camping it up. [Article].

Another early relative of the modern food truck is the lunch wagon, as conceived by food vendor Walter Scott in 1872. Scott cut windows in a small covered wagon, parked it in front of a newspaper office in Providence Rhode Island, and sold sandwiches, pies and coffee to pressmen and journalists. By the 1880s, former lunch-counter boy, Thomas H. Buckley, was manufacturing lunch wagons in Worcester, Massachusetts. He introduced various models, like the Owl and the White House Cafe, with features that included sinks, refrigerators and cooking stoves, also colored windows and other ornamentation.<ref>cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/who-made-that-food-truck.html | title=Who Made That Food Truck? | publisher=''New York Times' | date=May 2, 2014 | accessdate=13 December 2014 | author=Engber, Daniel</ref>

Later versions of the food truck were mobile canteen (place)|canteens, which were created in the late 1950s. These mobile canteen (place)|canteens were authorized by the U.S. Army and operated on stateside army bases.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/chron2b/1957b.html |title=1957 |publisher=Redstone.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114043901/http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/chron2b/1957b.html |archivedate=January 14, 2010 </ref>

The gourmet food truck
A modern-day food truck is not simply an ordinary taco truck one might find at a construction site.<ref>Olivia BarkerUSA, T. (n.d). [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/LIFE/usaedition/2011-08-11-food-trucks_CV_U.htm A foodie-fueled trend takes its act on the road]. USA Today.</ref> In 2009, ''New York (magazine)|New York'' magazine noted that the food truck had "largely transcended its roach-coach classification and is now a respectable venue for aspiring chefs to launch careers."<ref name=nymag /> These gourmet trucks' menus run the gamut of ethnic and fusion cuisine. Often focusing on limited but creative dishes at reasonable prices, they offer customers a chance to experience food they otherwise may not. Finding a niche seems to be a path to success for most trucks. While one truck may specialize in outlandish burgers, another may serve only lobster rolls.Citation needed|date=February 2015 Food trucks are now even Zagat rated.

Tracking food trucks has been made easy with social media like Facebook and Twitter, where a favorite gourmet truck can be located at any moment, with updates on specials, new menu items and location changes.<ref>Caldwell, A.

The popularity of food trucks lead to the creation of associations that protect and support their business rights, such as the Philadelphia Mobile Food Association.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.metro.us/philadelphia/news/local/2012/03/18/street-food-carts-and-trucks-have-grown-in-stature/ |title=Street food cards and trucks have grown in stature |publisher=Metro |date=2012-03-18 |accessdate=2013-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191721/http://www.metro.us/philadelphia/news/local/2012/03/18/street-food-carts-and-trucks-have-grown-in-stature/ |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= </ref>

Business and economics
Food trucks are subject to the same range of concerns as other foodservice businesses. They generally require a fixed address to accept delivery of supplies. A commercial kitchen may be needed for food prep. There are a variety of permits to obtain, and a health code to observe. Labor and fuel costs are a significant part of the overhead.<ref>cite web | url=http://www.hospitalitymagazine.com.au/food/profiles/the-business-of-street-food | title=The business of street food | publisher=Hospitality Magazine | date=23 August 2012 | accessdate=13 December 2014 | author=Bowling, Danielle</ref><ref name=pbs>cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/five-things/starting-your-own-food-truck/4268/ | title=Starting your own food truck | publisher=PBS | date=October 15, 2010 | accessdate=21 February 2015 |author1=Bellow, Lily |author2=Jackeline Pou </ref>

Legal definitions and requirements for food trucks vary widely by country and locality. For example, in Toronto, Canada, some of the requirements include business and liability insurance, a Commercial Vehicle Operator's Registration for the truck, permits for each municipality being operated in (downtown, various suburbs), a food handler certificate, appropriate driver's licenses for drivers, assistant's licenses for assistants, and a health inspection.<ref>cite web | url=http://torontofoodtrucks.ca/food-truck-faqs | title=Food Truck FAQs | publisher=Toronto Food Trucks (Freshdaily Inc.) | accessdate=13 December 2014</ref>

As the rising number and popularity of food trucks push them into the food mainstream, region by region, problems with local legislators and police reacting to new situations, and brick-and-mortar restaurants fearing competition, have to be worked through, in some cases creating significant business uncertainty.<ref name="wsj">cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443404004577576992254177540 | title=Street Fight: Food Trucks vs. Restaurants | publisher=''Wall Street Journal'' | date=9 Aug 2012 | accessdate=21 February 2015 | author=Needleman, Sarah E.</ref><ref name="japantoday">cite web | url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/food/view/great-eats-on-the-go | title=Great eats on the go | publisher=JapanToday | date=3 Jun 2013 | accessdate=13 December 2014 | author=Shannon, Lauren</ref><ref>cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hilary-gowins/three-cities-show-how-food-trucks_b_5621679.html | title=Three Cities Show How Food Trucks Live and Die on Political Whim | publisher=Huffington Post | date=26 July 2014 | accessdate=14 December 2014 | author=Gowins, Hilary</ref> Chicago long held the distinction of being the only city in the United States that did not allow food trucks to cook on board, which required trucks to prepare food in a commercial kitchen, then wrap and label the food and load it into a food warmer.

In June 2017, ''The Boston Globe'' reviewed the 2016 city health records and found that food trucks had been cited for violations 200 times, with half of the violations being minor in nature and the other half being serious violations. When compared to fixed location restaurants, the city closed nine of the 96 licensed food trucks in 2016 and closed only two out of 100 restaurants. A majority of the serious violations were related to the lack of water and hand washing.<ref name="Woolhouse" /> An earlier study showed that Boston food trucks, on average, received 2.68 violations per inspection between 2011 and July 2013, while restaurants received 4.56 citations for violations per inspection. For "critical foodborne violations"—defined by the city as activities that contribute to foodborne illness, such as improper labeling of ingredients—food trucks and restaurants were roughly equivalent, with 0.87 violations per inspection for food trucks, and 0.84 for restaurants.<!-- That's not a reference: <ref>cite web|last1=Bennie|title=Food trucks as safe as restaurants, study says|accessdate=22 September 2017</ref> -->Citation needed|date=March 2018

In Asia, the cuisine offered by food trucks requires simple skills, basic facilities and a relatively small amount of capital. They are plentiful, with large potential for income and often a very large sector for employment. Individuals facing difficulty finding work in formal sectors, will often venture into this industry, as it allows entire families to involve themselves in the preparing and cooking of foods sold to the public. The appeal involved in sustaining a food truck lie not only in the low capital requirement, but also in the flexibility of hours, with minimal constraints to locale. Street foods predominantly reflect local culture and flavor. Food trucks appeal to consumers in that they are often an inexpensive means of attaining quick meals. Location and word of mouth promotion has been credited for their widening success.<ref>Winarno, F.G. & Allain, A.
