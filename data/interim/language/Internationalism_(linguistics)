In linguistics, an internationalism or international word is a loanword that occurs in several languages (that is, translingualism|translingually) with the same or at least similar meaning and etymology. These words exist in "several different languages as a result of simultaneous or successive borrowings from the ultimate source" (I.V.Arnold)Cite quote|date=May 2012. Pronunciation and orthography are similar so that the word is understandable between the different languages.

It is debated how many languages are required so that a word is an internationalism.Citation needed|date=February 2008 Furthermore, the languages required can also depend on the specific target language (translation)|target language at stake. For example, according to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the most important languages that should include the same lexical item in order for it to qualify as an internationalism in Modern Hebrew|Hebrew are Yiddish language|Yiddish, Polish language|Polish, Russian language|Russian, French language|French, German language|German and English language|English.<ref>Pages 187-188 in Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew, by Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003.</ref>

The term is uncommon in English language|EnglishCitation needed|date=February 2008, although English has contributed a considerable number of words to world languages, e.g. the sport terms: ''football (soccer)|football, baseball, cricket, and golf''.

Origins
European internationalisms originate primarily from Latin or Greek language|Greek, but from other languages as well.Citation needed|date=February 2008 However, due to English language|English being the main lingua franca of the Western world, an increasing number of internationalisms originate from English. Many non-European words have also become international.

Diffusion
Internationalisms often spread together with the innovations they designate. Accordingly, there are semantic fields dominated by specific languages, e.g. the computing vocabulary which is mainly English language|English with internationalisms such as ''computer'', ''Disk storage|disk'', and ''Spam (electronic)|spam''. New inventions, political institutions, foodstuffs, leisure activities, science, and technological advances have all generated new lexemes and continue to do so: ''bionics, cybernetics, gene, coffee, chocolate, etc''..

Some internationalisms are spread by speakers of one language living in geographical regions where other languages are spoken.  For example, some internationalisms coming from the English in India are ''bungalow'', ''jute'', ''khaki'', ''mango'', ''pyjamas'', and ''sari''.Citation needed|date=May 2008<!---Aren't these examples rather due to British trade? --->

Use in constructed IALs
See also|Interlingua

Due to their widespread use, internationalisms are often loaned into international auxiliary languages. Many Constructed language|constructed IALs borrow vocabulary that is already known by learners, so that they are as easy as possible to learn.

Internationalisms that occur in many languages are usually Interlingua and eligibility of international words|eligible to be included in Interlingua. Early internationalisms, such as those from French and German, tend to be part of Interlingua's basic vocabulary. Later internationalisms, often from English, tend to be Interlingua loanwords. Among Asian languages, Arabic language|Arabic most often provides basic vocabulary, while Japanese language|Japanese contributes recent loanwords.
