A backronym, or bacronym, is a constructed phrase that purports to be the source of a word that is an acronym. Backronyms may be invented with either serious or humorous intent, or they may be a type of false etymology or folk etymology.

An acronym is a word derived from the initial letters of the words of a phrase:<ref name="dict-ref-acronym">

</ref><!-- this was chosen because more people are familiar with radar than RAM: ~~~ -->

By contrast, a backronym is constructed by creating a new phrase to fit an already-existing word, name, or acronym. For example, the United States Department of Justice assigns to its Amber Alert program the meaning "America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response,"<ref>cite web|url=http://www.amberalert.gov/ |title=AMBER Alert - America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response |publisher=Amberalert.gov |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2010-07-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100727174209/http://www.amberalert.gov/| archivedate= 27 July 2010 | deadurl= no</ref> but the term originally referred to Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old abducted and murdered in Texas in 1996.

Backronyms are often used for comedic effect, as when NASA named its International Space Station|ISS treadmill the Combined Operational Load-Bearing External Resistance Treadmill (C.O.L.B.E.R.T.) after Stephen Colbert. The backronym was a lighthearted compromise in recognition of the comedian's ability to sway NASA's online vote for the naming of an ISS module later named ''Tranquility (ISS module)|Tranquility''.<ref name="colbert">cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/colberttreadmill.html |title=COLBERT Ready for Serious Exercise |publisher=NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date=2010-10-23 |accessdate=2013-06-13</ref>

Backronyms can be constructed for educational purposes, for example to form mnemonics. An example of such a mnemonic is the Apgar score, used to assess the health of newborn babies. The rating system was devised by and named after Virginia Apgar, but ten years after the initial publication, the backronym ''APGAR'' was coined in the US as a mnemonic learning aid: Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity and Respiration.<ref>

Alcoholics Anonymous and other Twelve-step programs|12-step programs use backronyms as teaching tools, similar to slogans such as "one day at a time", or "Let go, let God", but often with an ironic edge. For example, a ''slip'' may be expanded as "Sobriety Losing Its Priority",<ref>

Backronyms are also created as jokes or as slogans, often expressing consumer loyalties or frustration. For example, the name of the restaurant chain ''Arby's'' is a play on the letters "RB", referring to the company's founders, the Raffel brothers. An advertising campaign in the 1980s created a backronym with the slogan "America’s Roast Beef, Yes Sir!"<ref>cite web|last=Gross |first=Daniel |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2234863/ |title=Too Much Beef: Why Arby's is so low on the restaurant food chain. |publisher=Slate.com |date=2009-11-07 |accessdate=2010-07-08</ref>

Some backronyms name the subject to make obvious its purpose or characteristics; the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb (abbreviated MOAB) and others in the series were heavily promoted by the United States as the "Mother of All Bombs", a backronym during the Iraq War. US news coverage in the days leading up to the United States 2003 invasion of Iraq claimed "Mother of All Bombs" to be the US response to Saddam Hussein's phrase "mother of all battles" from the first Gulf War.<ref>cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/03/12/air-force-tests-mother-all-bombs/ |title=Air Force Tests 'Mother of All Bombs' |publisher=Fox News |date=2003-03-12 |accessdate=2013-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617165411/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/03/12/air-force-tests-mother-all-bombs/ |archive-date=2013-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= </ref>

In commercial aviation, ETOPS is officially an acronym for Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards,<ref>cite web|title=CAP 789: Requirements and Guidance Material for Operators |url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP%20789.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Civil Aviation Authority |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=2014-03-24 |quote=Extended Range Twin Operations (ETOPS) Pre-Departure Service Check |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127112145/http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP%20789.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-27 |df= </ref> defining safety standards for long-distance over-water flights by planes with only two engines, but in aviation vernacular, the colloquial backronym is "Engines Turn Or Passengers Swim."<ref>cite book|last=Bowen |first=John T. |title=The Economic Geography of Air Transportation: Space, Time, and the Freedom of the Sky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BlyLAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA285|date=5 April 2010 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-15657-2 |page=285 |quote=In the dark humor common in the airline industry, ETOPS is sometimes translated as "engines turn or passengers swim," but in actual practice, the safety of twinjets on over-water routes has been outstanding</ref>

Many companies or products have spawned multiple humorous backronyms, with positive connotations asserted by supporters or negative ones by detractors. For example, the car company Ford was said to stand for "First On Race Day", by aficionados,<ref>cite web|url=http://www.competitionplus.com/2006_07/dick_brannan.html |title=Drag Racing's Internet Magazine |publisher=Competition Plus.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023131543/http://www.competitionplus.com/2006_07/dick_brannan.html |archivedate=2009-10-23 |df= </ref> but disparaged as "Fix Or Repair Daily", by critics.<ref>cite web|author=Jalopnik.com |url=http://jalopnik.com/5879789/the-definitive-guide-to-derogatory-auto-acronyms |title=The definitive guide to derogatory auto acronyms |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2014-06-17</ref><ref>cite web|author=BusinessBalls.com |url=http://www.businessballs.com/acronyms.htm |title=acronyms and abbreviations |publisher=Business Balls.com |date=2014-08-20 |accessdate=2014-08-20</ref> Similar backronyms have been directed against many other automakers, such as "Fix It Again Tony" for Fiat.<ref>cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/motors/2009/0506/1224245982906.html| title=Fix it again, Sergio –  and then fix the rest of 'em | date=May 6, 2009| publisher=The Irish Times |accessdate=September 25, 2009</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://www.newser.com/story/57710/fiat-has-long-shed-fix-it-again-tony-reputation.html |title=Fiat Has Long Shed 'Fix It Again Tony' Reputation |first1=John |last1=Johnson |publisher=Newser |date=April 30, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2012</ref>

Backronyms have also been coined by military personnel during wartime. The backronym for Spam (food)|Spam, "Something Posing As Meat", was said to have originated from jaundiced soldiers who were sick of eating canned meat.<ref>cite book|title=New Words for Old: Recycling Our Language for the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VPO4CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|first=Caroline|last=Taggart|publisher=Michael O'Mara Books|date=2015|isbn=9781782434733</ref> The British contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq was code-named "Operation Telic", meaning "directed or tending to a definite end", from the Greek word lang-grc|τέλος|telos|label=none.<ref>cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/telic|title=telic - Definition of telic in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English</ref> The meaning was initially unknown but as initial planning took place over the Christmas 2002 period, the term became jokingly known amongst service personnel as a backronym for "Tell Everyone Leave Is Cancelled".<ref>cite book|title=Bullet Magnet: Britain's Most Highly Decorated Frontline Soldier|author-link=Mick Flynn|first=Mick|last=Flynn|publisher=Hachette (publisher)|Hachette UK|date=2010|isbn=9780297860013</ref>

Backronyms are sometimes created to name laws or programs. The official title of the Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act, a 2001 Act of Congress|Act of the U.S. Congress, is "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001".<ref>Public Law #56 of the 107th Congress USPL|107|56</ref> Commentators have noted a trend among US lawmakers to devise names that form a desired acronym.<ref>cite news|last=Cohen|first=Micah|title=The Most Powerful Special Interest in Washington: The Acronym|work=FiveThirtyEight|date=May 19, 2012|url=https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/the-most-powerful-special-interest-in-washington-the-acronym/ |access-date=2017-03-21</ref>

=As false etymologies=
Sometimes a backronym is so commonly heard that it is widely but incorrectly believed to have been used in the formation of the original word, and amounts to a false etymology or an urban legend. Examples include wikt:posh|''posh''anchor|POSH, an adjective describing stylish items or members of the upper class. A popular story derives the word as an acronym from "port out, starboard home", referring to nineteenth century first-class cabins on ocean liners, which were shaded from the sun on outbound voyages east (e.g. from Britain to British India|India) and homeward heading voyages west.<ref name="posh">

The word's actual etymology is unknown, but more likely related to Romani language|Romani ''påš xåra'' ("half-penny") or to Urdu (borrowed from Persian) ''safed-pōśh'' (one who wears "white robes"), a derogatory term for wealthy people.<ref>cite encyclopedia |year=2009 |title =posh, ''adj.'' and ''n.'' |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford</ref>

Lexicographer Jesse Sheidlower writes in his book The F-Word (book)|''The F-Word'' that acronyms were rare in the English language prior to the twentieth century, and most etymologies of common words or phrases that suggest origin from an acronym are false.<ref name=F-word>Cite book |last1=Sheidlower |first1=Jesse |authorlink1=Jesse Sheidlower |title=The F-Word |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2009 |isbn=0-19-539311-2</ref>

The distress signal SOS is often believed to be an abbreviation for "Save Our Ship" or "Save Our Souls".
