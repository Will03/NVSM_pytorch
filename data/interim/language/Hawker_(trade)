A hawker is a vendor of merchandise that can be easily transported; the term is roughly synonymous with peddler or costermonger. In most places where the term is used, a hawker sells inexpensive items, handicrafts or food items. Whether stationary or mobile, hawkers often advertise by loud street cries or chants, and conduct banter with customers, so to attract attention and enhance sales.

When accompanied by a demonstration or detailed explanation of the product, the hawker is sometimes referred to as a Product demonstration|demonstrator or pitchman.

The terms peddler and hawker are often used synonymously. Social commentator Henry Mayhew wrote "Among the more ancient of the trades, then carried on in England, is that of the hawker or pedlar"  and also notes that "the hawker dealt, in the old times, more in textile fabrics than in anything else." In several passages of his work, Mayhew categorises hawkers, hucksters and peddlers as a single group of itinerant salesman and claims that he is unable to say what distinction was drawn between a hawker and a huckster. Mayhew estimated the number of licensed pedlars in 1861 as 14,038 in England, 624 in Wales and 2,561 in Scotland. <ref>Mayhew, Henry,''London Labour and the London Poor,'' volume 1, 1861, p. 364 and p. 377</ref>

In many African List of metropolitan areas in Africa|metropolitan areas, hawkers commonly referred to as vendors are a very usual sight. They sell a wide range of goods such as fish, fruits, vegetables, clothes and books. In suburban areas, they go around announcing themselves from house to house. While in more commercial areas they usually have stands or lay their goods on the ground. In the afternoons you'll find many of them selling commercial goods on the more crowded parts of the cities, while at night they sell juices, tea and snack items. They sell goods at lower prices than shops making them an attractive shopping stop to people of low income.<ref>Cite news|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2016-04-15-african-cities-street-hawkers-and-traders|title=Why African cities are full of street vendors and hawkers - and how we can create better jobs|date=2016-04-18|work=MG Africa|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://blog.iese.edu/africa/2014/03/05/lagos-street-vendors/|title=Lagos Street Vendors and Informal Economy in Africa !

According to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (India)|Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, there are 10 million street vendors in India, with Mumbai accounting for 250,000, Delhi has 200,000, Kolkata, more than 150,000, and Ahmedabad, 100,000. Most of them are immigrants or laid-off workers, work for an average 10–12 hours a day, and remain impoverished. Though the prevalent License Raj|license-permit raj in Indian bureaucracy ended for most retailing in the 1990s, it continues in this trade. Inappropriate license ceiling in most cities, like Mumbai which has a ceiling 14,000 licenses, means more vendors hawk their goods illegally, which also makes them prone to the bribery and extortion culture under local police and municipal authories, besides harassment, heavy fines and sudden evictions. In Kolkata, the profession was a Cognizable offence|cognisable and non-bailable offense.<ref name=mint12>cite news |title=Street Vendors: Tabled in Parliament’s last session, this Bill could bring security to our urban poor|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/NN6NKSWlU0wsojynMwFBBJ/Street-Vendors--The-god-of-small-sellers.html |publisher=Mint, Lounge |date=Nov 2, 2012 </ref><ref>cite news |title=Reclaiming the city for street vendors |url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/Harsh_Mander/reclaiming-the-city-for-street-vendors/article4058121.ece |publisher=The Hindu|date=November 3, 2012 </ref><ref>http://www.bip.org.bd/SharingFiles/journal_book/20140427160039.pdf</ref>

Over the years the street vendors have organized themselves into trade unions and associations, and numerous NGO's have started working for them. In fact, The National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI) based in Delhi, is a federation of 715 street vendor organizations, trade unions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).<ref name="mint12" /> Kolkata has two such unions, namely the Bengal Hawkers Association and the Calcutta Hawkers' Men Union.

 Bangladesh 
In the capital city of Dhaka, street vendors such as small tea stalls, and popular food stalls (fuchka, chotpoti) along the public spaces (university campuses, bus terminals, market places) have a significant role to cater to the urban population.<ref>http://www.bip.org.bd/SharingFiles/journal_book/20140427160039.pdf</ref> Street vendors are a source of food security, especially to the poorer section of the urban population. Street vending is significant portion of Dhaka's informal economy, an employment opportunity for better livelihoods of the urban poor.

Other countries
Balut (egg)|Balut is a popular dish sold by hawkers in the Philippines, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. In both China and Hong Kong, hawkers' inventories often include fish ball, beef ball, butzaigo, Chestnut|roasted chestnuts, and stinky tofu. In Singapore and Malaysia, these stands have become so successful that many have chosen to set up shop more permanently in a hawker center.

Across Asia, stalls have been set up with little to no government monitoring. Due to health concerns and other liability problems, the food culture has been seriously challenged in Indonesia, though without marked success.<ref>Winarno, F.G. and A. Allain.

Brazil
Image:Banca-de-camelô.jpg|thumb|right|Camelô stand in Porto Alegre, Brazil

Camelô is a Brazilian Portuguese name given to street vendors in major Brazilian city|cities.

Law enforcement often enters into conflict – sometimes physical – with camelôs, for selling low-quality products (often imported from Asia), making improper use of public space (blocking sidewalks and pedestrian traffic), and for not paying the same taxes that licensed retailers pay. Their presence is considered to be a result of the alarming rise in unemployment, although their lifestyle might be better referred to as "subemployment." Many people who work as camelôs sell their products knowing that they are of low quality, and charge high prices nonetheless.

The word is borrowed from the French language|French ''camelot,'' meaning "merchant of low-quality goods," and the term ''marreteiro'' is also sometimes used. The difference between camelôs and so-called "ambulantes" is that camelôs have fixed "storefronts" on a particular sidewalk, whereas "ambulantes" sell their wares throughout an area.
