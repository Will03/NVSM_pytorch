Bungi (also Bungee, Bungie, Bungay, or the Red River Dialect) is a creole language of Scottish English, the Orcadian dialect of Scots language|Scots, Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic, Cree language|Cree, and Ojibwe language|Ojibwe.<ref>Wurm ''et al.'' (1996: 1178).</ref> It is spoken by the Métis people (Canada)|Red River Métis in present-day Manitoba, Canada.

Bungi has been categorized as a Post-creole continuum|post-creole,<ref>Blain. (1989: 15)</ref> with the distinctive features of the language gradually language death|abandoned by successive generations of speakers in favour of standard Canadian English. Today, the creole mostly survives in the speech of a few elders, and the use of non-standard pronunciations and terminology by a wider population.

Name
The name derives from either lang-oj|bangii, or lang-cr|pahkī,&ensp;both words meaning ''a little bit''. In addition to describing the language, Bungi can refer to First Nations persons generally, or those with mixed European and First Nations ancestry (regardless of perceived cultural affiliation).<ref>Blain. (1989: 2).</ref> In these colloquial uses the term may have mildly pejorative connotations, even when used by speakers to describe themselves.<ref>Blain. (1989: 33).</ref>

Description
Scots language
The lexicon is mostly English with words from Cree and Ojibwa interspersed throughout.

Social context
Many speakers in Blain's studies were ashamed to speak the dialect as the speech community members were discriminated against by other groups. In many cases, children were forbidden from speaking their mother tongue in the Canadian Indian residential school system.

The major difference with other dialects is in the phonology (sound system and pronunciation). Voice quality differences are noticeably apparent.

=Scholarship=
The main linguistic documentation of this dialect lies within Blain  (1987, 1989) and Walter (1969–1970).
