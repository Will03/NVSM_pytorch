"OK" (spelling variations include "okay", "O.K.", "ok") is an American English word denoting approval, acceptance, agreement, assent, acknowledgment, or a sign of indifference. "OK" is frequently used as a loanword in other languages. It has been described as the most frequently spoken or written word on the planet.<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1455146/ok-most-spoken-word-planet-marks-its-175th-anniversary "OK, 'most spoken word on the planet', marks its 175th anniversary"] South China Morning Post. 23 March 2014.</ref> The origins of the word are disputed.

As an adjective, "OK" principally means "adequate" or "acceptable" as a contrast to "bad" ("The boss approved this, so it is OK to send out"); it can also mean "mediocre" when used in contrast with "good" ("The french fries were great, but the burger was just OK"). It fulfills a similar role as an adverb ("Wow, you did OK for your first time skiing!"). As an interjection, it can denote compliance ("OK, I will do that"), or agreement ("OK, that is fine"). It can mean "assent" when it is used as a noun ("the boss gave her the OK to the purchase") or, more colloquially, as a verb ("the boss OKed the purchase"). "OK", as an adjective, can express acknowledgment without approval.<ref>cite web|last=Beaver|first=David|title=Not OK.|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2979|work=languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu|accessdate=10 December 2014|authorlink=David Beaver|date=20 February 2011|ref=harv</ref> As a versatile discourse marker or Backchannel (linguistics)|back-channeling item, it can also be used with appropriate Nonverbal communication#Paralanguage: nonverbal cues of the voice|voice tone to show doubt or to seek confirmation ("OK?", "Is that OK?").<ref name="Yngve, Victor page 568">Yngve, Victor.

He also documented controversy surrounding ''OK'' and the history of its False etymology|folk etymologies, both of which are intertwined with the history of the word itself.  Read argues that, at the time of the expression's first appearance in print, a broader fad existed in the United States of "comical misspellings" and of forming and employing acronyms, themselves based on colloquial speech patterns:

quote|The abbreviation fad began in Boston in the summer of 1838 ... OFM, "our first men," and used expressions like NG, "no go," GT, "gone to Texas," and SP, "small potatoes." Many of the abbreviated expressions were exaggerated misspellings, a stock in trade of the humorists of the day. One predecessor of OK was OW, "oll wright."sfn|Adams|1985

The general fad is speculated to have existed in spoken or informal written U.S. English for a decade or more before its appearance in newspapers. ''OK'''s original presentation as "all correct" was later varied with spellings such as "Oll Korrect" or even "Ole Kurreck".

The term appears to have achieved national prominence in 1840, when supporters of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic political party claimed during the United States presidential election, 1840|1840 United States presidential election that it stood for "Old Kinderhook", a nickname for the Democratic president and candidate for reelection, Martin Van Buren, a native of Kinderhook (town), New York|Kinderhook, New York. "Vote for OK" was snappier than using his Dutch name.sfn|The Economist|2002 In response, Whig Party (United States)|Whig opponents attributed ''OK'', in the sense of "Oll Korrect," to Andrew Jackson's bad spelling. The country-wide publicity surrounding the election appears to have been a critical event in ''OK'''s history, widely and suddenly popularizing it across the United States.

Read proposed an etymology of "OK" in "Old Kinderhook" in 1941.sfn|Read|1941 The evidence presented in that article was somewhat sparse, and the connection to "Oll Korrect" not fully elucidated. Various challenges to the etymology were presented; e.g., Heflin's 1962 article.sfn|Heflin|1962 However, Read's landmark 1963–1964 papers silenced most of the skepticism.  Read's etymology gained immediate acceptance, and is now offered without reservation in most dictionaries.<ref>Online edition of  [http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/OK ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' [Houghton Mifflin&#93;] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606102657/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/OK |date=6 June 2011 </ref>  Read himself was nevertheless open to evaluating alternative explanations:

quote|Some believe that the Boston newspaper's reference to OK may not be the earliest. Some are attracted to the claim that it is of American-Indian origin. There is an Indian word, okeh, used as an affirmative reply to a question. Mr Read treated such doubting calmly. "Nothing is absolute," he once wrote, "nothing is forever."<ref>cite news|title=Allen Read|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1403400|accessdate=29 December 2014|newspaper=The Economist|date=24 October 2002|ref=harvid|The Economist|2002</ref>

=Choctaw=
In "All Mixed Up", the folk singer Pete Seeger sang that "OK" was of Choctaw origin,sfn|Fay|2007 as the dictionaries of the time tended to agree. Three major American reference works (Webster's, New Century, Funk & Wagnalls) cited this etymology as the probable origin until as late as 1961.sfn|Fay|2007

The earliest written evidence for the Choctaw origin is provided in work by the missionaries Cyrus Byington and Alfred Wright in 1825. These missionaries ended many sentences in their translation of the Bible with the particle "okeh", meaning "it is so", and was listed as an alternative spelling in the 1913 Webster's.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/okeh "okeh"]. (n.d.) ''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary''. (1913). Retrieved 29 December 2014.</ref>

Byington's ''Dictionary of the Choctaw Language'' confirms the ubiquity of the "okeh" particle,sfn|Byington|1915 and his ''Grammar of the Choctaw Language'' calls the particle ''-keh'' an "affirmative contradistinctive", with the "distinctive" o- prefix.<ref>cite book|first=Cryus |last=Byington|year=1870|title=Grammar of the Choctaw Language|publisher= McCalla & Stavely|url= https://books.google.com/?id=n1xiSjMTpQgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cyrus+byington|page= 14</ref>

quote|Subsequent Choctaw spelling books de-emphasized the spellings lists in favor of straight prose, and they made use of the particle[,] but they too never included it in the word lists or discussed it directly.  The presumption was that the use of particle "oke" or "hoke" was so common and self-evident as to preclude any need for explanation or discussion for either its Choctaw or non-Choctaw readership.sfn|Fay|2007

The Choctaw language was one of the languages spoken at this time in the South-Eastern United States by a tribe with significant contact with African slaves.<ref>cite book|first=Robert Elliot |last= Flickinger|year=1911|title=The Choctaw Freedmen and The Story of Oak Hill Industrial Academy|url= https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23321/23321-h/23321-h.htm|publisher=gutenberg.org</ref> The major language of trade in this area, Mobilian Jargon, was based on Choctaw-Chickasaw, two Muskogean-family languages.

Arguments for a more Southern origin for the word note the tendency of English to adopt loan words in language contact situations, as well as the ubiquity of the OK particle.  Similar particles exist in native language groups distinct from Iroquoian (Algonquian (language)|Algonquian, Cree cf. "[http://www.creedictionary.com/search/index.php?q=ekosi&scope=1 ekosi]").

=West African=
A verifiable early written attestation of the particle 'kay' is from transcription by Smyth (1784) of a North Carolina slave not wanting to be flogged by a European visiting America:

quote|Kay, massa, you just leave me, me sit here, great fish jump up into da canoe, here he be, massa, fine fish, massa; me den very grad; den me sit very still, until another great fish jump into de canoe; ...sfn|Smyth|1784|pp=1:118-21

A West African (Mande and/or Bantu) etymology has been argued in scholarly sources, tracing the word back to the Wolof language|Wolof and Bantu languages|Bantu word ''waw-kay'' or the Mande languages|Mande (aka "Mandinke" or "Mandingo") phrase ''o ke''.

David Dalby first made the claim that the particle "OK" could have African origins in the 1969 Hans Wolff Memorial Lecture. His argument was reprinted in various newspaper articles between 1969 and 1971.sfn|Cassidy|1981 This suggestion has also been mentioned more recently by Joseph Holloway, who argued in the 1993 book ''The African Heritage of American English'' (co-written with a retired missionary) that various West African languages have near-homophone discourse markers with meanings such as "yes indeed" or which serve as part of the Backchannel (linguistics)|back-channeling repertoire.<ref name="Yngve, Victor page 568"/>sfn|Holloway|Vass|1993 Though Frederic Cassidy challenged Dalby's claims, asserting that there is no documentary evidence that any of these African-language words had any causal link with its use in the American press,sfn|Cassidy|1981  one can certainly wonder at the fact that this standard of written proof does not account for the illiteracy in which the West African speakers were kept during the period of slavery in question.

The West African hypothesis had not been accepted by 1981 by any etymologists,sfn|Cassidy|1981<ref name="onlineetym">cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ok|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=</ref><ref name="lighter">Lighter, Jonathon, (1994).

=Alternative etymologies=
A large number of origins have been proposed. Some of them are thought to fall into the category of False etymology|folk etymology and are proposed based merely on apparent similarity between ''OK'' and one or another phrase in a foreign language with a similar meaning and sound.  Some examples are:

*A corruption from the speech of the large number of descendants of Scottish and Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots (Scots-Irish) immigrants to North America, of the common Scots phrase ''och aye'' ("oh yes").sfn|Read|1964
*A borrowing of the Greek language|Greek phrase lang|el|όλα καλά (transl|el|''óla kalá''), meaning "all good".sfn|Weber|1942

Early history
Allen Walker Read identifies the earliest known use of ''O.K.'' in print as 1839, in the edition of 23 March of the ''Boston Morning Post''. The announcement of a trip by the Anti-Bell-Ringing Society (a "frolicsome group" according to Read) received attention from the Boston papers. Charles Gordon Greene wrote about the event using the line that is widely regarded as the first instance of this strain of ''OK'', complete with Gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss:

quote|The above is from the ''Providence Journal'', the editor of which is a little too quick on the trigger, on this occasion. We said not a word about our deputation passing "through the city" of Providence.—We said our brethren were going to New York in the Richmond, and they did go, as per Post of Thursday. The "Chairman of the Committee on Charity Lecture Bells," is one of the deputation, and perhaps if he should return to Boston, via Providence, he of the Journal, and his ''train''-band, would have his "contribution box," et ceteras, ''o.k.''—all correct—and cause the corks to fly, like ''sparks'', upward.

Read gives a number of subsequent appearances in print. Seven instances were accompanied with glosses that were variations on "all correct" such as "oll korrect" or "ole kurreck", but five appeared with no accompanying explanation, suggesting that the word was expected to be well known to readers and possibly in common colloquial use at the time.

Various claims of earlier usage have been made.  For example, it was claimed that the phrase appeared in a 1790 court record from Sumner County, Tennessee, discovered in 1859 by a Tennessee historian named Albigence Waldo Putnam, in which Andrew Jackson apparently said "proved a bill of sale from Hugh McGary to Gasper Mansker, for an uncalled good, which was O.K.".<ref>George W. Stimpson. (1934) "Nuggets Of Knowledge"</ref> However, Read challenged such claims, and his assertions have been generally accepted. The great lawyer who successfully argued many Indian rights claims,clarify|post-text=(Who?)|date=January 2019 however, supports the Jacksonian popularization of the term based on its Choctaw origin.<ref>Felix S. Cohen, "Americanizing the White Man," ''The American Scholar'' vol. 21, no. 2 (Spring 1952): 177-191</ref>

David Dalby (see above) brought up some other earlier attested usages.  One example from 1941 is the apparent notation "we arrived ok" in the hand-written diary of William Richardson going from Boston to New Orleans in 1815, about a month after the Battle of New Orleans.sfn|Heflin|1941|p=90 Frederic Cassidy asserts that he personally tracked down this diary and notes that:

quote|After many attempts to track down this diary, Read and I at last discovered that it is owned by the grandson of the original writer, Professor L. Richardson, Jr., of the Department of Classical Studies at Duke University. Through his courtesy we were able to examine this manuscript carefully, to make greatly enlarged photographs of it, and to become convinced (as is Richardson) that, whatever the marks in the manuscript are, they are not OK.sfn|Cassidy|1981

Similarly, H. L. Mencken, who originally considered it "very clear that 'o. k.' is actually in the manuscript",sfn|Wait|1941 later recanted his endorsement of the expression, asserting that it was used no earlier than 1839. Mencken (following Read) described the diary entry as a misreading of the author's self-correction, and stated it was in reality the first two letters of the words ''a h[andsome]'' before noticing the phrase had been used in the previous line and changing his mind.sfn|Mencken|1945|p=275

Another example given by Dalby is a Jamaican planter's diary of 1816, which records a black slave saying "Oh ki, massa, doctor no need be fright, we no want to hurt him".<ref>David Dalby (Reader (academic rank)|Reader in West African Languages, SOAS, U of London). (1971) "The Etymology of O.K.," ''The Times'', 14 January 1971</ref> Cassidy asserts that this is a misreading of the source, which actually begins "Oh, ki, massa ...", where ''ki'' is a phrase by itself:

quote|In all other examples of this interjection that I have found, it is simply ''ki'' (once spelled ''kie''). As here, it expresses surprise, amusement, satisfaction, mild expostulation, and the like. It has nothing like the meaning of the adjective OK, which in the earliest recorded examples means 'all right, good,' though it later acquires other meanings, but even when used as an interjection does not express surprise, expostulation, or anything similar.sfn|Cassidy|1981

Variations
Whether this word is printed as OK, Ok, ok, okay, or O.K. is a matter normally resolved in the style manual for the publication involved. Dictionaries and style guides such as ''The Chicago Manual of Style'' and ''The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage'' provide no consensus.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2008/09/im-ok-youre-okay.html |title=I'm OK, you're okay |publisher=Grammarphobia |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2011</ref>

Usage

In 1961, NASA popularized the variant "A-OK" during the launch of Alan Shepard's Mercury-Redstone 3|Mercury mission.<ref name="time19620302">cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,939891,00.html |work=Time |title=Calm Voice from Space |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |date=March 2, 1962 |publisher=Time Inc. |subscription=yes</ref>

=International usage=
In Brazil, Mexico and Peru, as well as in other Latin American countries, the word is pronounced just as it is in English and is used very frequently. Spanish speakers often spell the word "okey" to conform with the spelling rules of the language. In Brazil, it may be also pronounced as "ô-kei". In Portugal, it is used with its Portuguese pronunciation and sounds something like "ókâi" (similar to the English pronunciation but with the "ó" sounding like the "o" in "lost" or "top"), or even as 'oh-kapa', from the letters ''O'' ('ó') and ''K'' ('capa'). In Spain it's much less common than in Latin American countries (words such as "vale" or "de acuerdo" are preferred) but it may still be heard.

In Flanders and the Netherlands, "OK" has become part of the everyday Dutch language|Dutch language. It is pronounced the same way.

Arabic speakers also use the word (أوكي) widely, particularly in areas of former British presence like Egypt, Jordan, Israel/Palestine and Iraq, but also all over the Arab world due to the prevalence of American cinema and television. It is pronounced just as it is in English but is very rarely seen in Arabic newspapers and formal media.

In Hebrew, the word ''OK'' is common as an equivalent to the Hebrew word בסדר [b'seder] ('adequate', 'in order'). It is written as it sounds in English אוקיי.

It is used in Japan and Korea in a somewhat restricted sense, fairly equivalent to "all right". ''OK'' is often used in colloquial Japanese as a replacement for 大丈夫 (daijōbu "all right")　or いい (ii "good") and often followed by です (desu – the Copula (linguistics)|copula). A transliteration of the English word, written as オーケー (lit. "ōkē") or オッケー (lit. "okkē") is also often used in the same manner as the English, and is becoming more popular in recent years. In Korean, 오케이 (literally "okay") can be used colloquially in place of 네 (ne, "yes") when expressing approval or acknowledgment.

In Chinese, the term Zh|c=好|p=hǎo| labels=no (literally: "good"), can be modified to fit most of usages of ''OK''. For example, zh|c=好了|p=hǎo le| labels=no closely resembles the interjection usage of ''OK''. The "了" indicates a change of state; in this case it indicates the achievement of consensus. Likewise, "OK" is commonly transformed into "OK了" (OK le) when communicating with foreigners or with fellow Cantonese speaking people in at least Hong Kong and possibly to an extent other regions of China.<ref>3 min 37 s video, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSHziqJWYcM Youtube.com]</ref> Other usages of ''OK'' such as "I am OK" can be translated as zh|s=我还好|p=wǒ hái hǎo| labels=no. In Hong Kong, movies or dramas set in modern times use the term "ok" as part of the sprinkling of English included in otherwise Cantonese dialog.  In Mandarin Chinese it is also somewhat humorously used in the "spelling" of the word for karaoke, "wikt:卡拉OK|卡拉OK", pronounced "kah-lah-oh-kei" (Mandarin does not natively have a syllable with the pronunciation "kei"). On the computer, OK is usually translated as "确定," which means "confirm" or "confirmed".

In Taiwan, "OK" is frequently used in various sentences, popular among but not limited to younger generations. This includes the aforementioned "OK了" (Okay le), "OK嗎" (Okay ma), meaning "Is it okay?" or "OK啦" (Okay la), a strong, persuading affirmative, as well as the somewhat tongue-in-cheek explicit yes/no construction "O不OK？" (O bù OK?), "Is it OK or not?"

In Russia, "OK" is used very frequently for any positive meaning. The word in Russian has many morphologies: "окей", "океюшки", "ок", "окейно", etc.

In France and Belgium, "OK" is used to communicate agreement, and is generally followed by a French phrase (e.g. ''OK, d'accord'', "ok, chef")  or another borrowing (e.g., ''OK, boss. ok, bye.''). Rarely pronounced /ɔk/ these days, except by young children encountering dialog boxes for the first times.

In the Philippines "okay lang" is a common expression, literally meaning "just okay" or "just fine". Sometimes spelled as ''okey''.

In Malay language|Malay, it is frequently used with the emphatic suffix "lah": OK-lah.

In Vietnamese language|Vietnamese, it is spelled "Ô kê".

In India, it is often used after a sentence to mean "did you get it?", often not regarded politely, for example, "I want this job done, OK?" or at the end of a conversation (mostly on the phone) followed by "bye" as in "OK, bye."

In Indonesia, "OK" is also used as a slogan of national television station RCTI since the year 1994.

In Pakistan, "OK" has become a part of Urdu and Punjabi languages.

In Germany, "OK" is spelled as "o.k." or "O.K." or "okay". It may be pronounced as in English, but /ɔˈkeː/ or /oˈkeː/ are also common.<ref>http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/o__k_#block-duden-tiles-4</ref> The meaning ranges from acknowledgement to describing something neither good nor bad, same as in US/UK usage.

In Maldivian language|Maldivian Okay is used in different ways, often used to agree with something, more often used while departing from a gathering "Okay Dahnee/Kendee."

In Singapore, "OK" is often used with suffix-es used in "Singlish" such as OK lor, OK lah, OK meh, OK leh ... etc. which are used in different occasions.

Gesture

File:OK Sign.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Okay sign
In the United States and much of Europe a related gesture is made by touching the index finger with the thumb (forming a rough circle) and raising of the remaining fingers.<ref name=FGuide>Armstrong, Nancy & Melissa Wagner. (2003) ''Field Guide to Gestures: How to Identify and Interpret Virtually Every Gesture Known to Man.'' Philadelphia: Quirk Books.</ref> It is not known whether the gesture is derived from the expression, or if the gesture appeared first. The gesture was popularized in America in 1836 as a symbol to support then Presidential candidate Martin Van Buren. This was because Van Buren's nickname, Old Kinderhook, derived from his hometown of Kinderhook, NY, had the initials O K.<ref name=FGuide/> Similar gestures have different meanings in other cultures, some offensive, others devotional.<ref name="aol">[https://www.aol.com/article/2010/07/26/dangerous-body-language-abroad/19554303/ Dangerous Body Language Abroad], by Matthew Link.

''OK'' is used to label Button (computing)|buttons in Dialog Box#Application modal|modal dialog boxes such as error messages or print dialogs, indicating that the user must press the button to accept the contents of the dialog box and continue.  When a modal dialog box contains only one button, it is almost always labeled "OK" by convention and Default (computer science)|default, usually rendered to the screen in upper case without punctuation: ''OK'', rather than ''O.K.'', ''Okay'', or ''Ok''.  The ''OK'' button can probably be traced to user interface research done for the Apple Lisa.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Do_It.txt&topic=Lisa |title=Apple user interface designers pick '&#39;OK'&#39; |publisher=Folklore.org |date=17 July 1980 |accessdate=12 June 2011</ref> The inspiration was likely the -ok parameter in Unix' ''find'' command.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20001114221400/http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?find search for "-ok command ;"]</ref>

In HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol, upon which the World Wide Web is based, a successful response from the server is defined as ''OK'' (with the numerical code HTTP 200|200 as specified in RFC 2616).  The Session Initiation Protocol also defines a response, ''200 OK'', which conveys success for most requests (RFC 3261).

Some Linux distributions, including those based on Red Hat, display boot progress on successive lines on-screen, which include ''[&nbsp;OK&nbsp;]''.
