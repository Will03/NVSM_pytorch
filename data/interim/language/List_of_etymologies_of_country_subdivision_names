Austria

=States of Austria|States=
*Burgenland (German; lang-hu|Várvidék; lang-hr|Gradišće): originally called ''Vierburgenland'', "Land of four Burgs (castles)", a name suggested in 1919 from the endings of the four former counties forming the state: Bratislava|Preßburg, Moson|Wieselburg, Sopron|Ödenburg and Vas|Eisenburg. In 1922 Austria ceded Ödenburg to Hungary and dropped the numeric prefix ''Vier-'' ("four"); the remaining three counties became Burgenland.<ref>[http://aeiou.iicm.tugraz.at/aeiou.encyclop.b/b944915_en.htm Burgenland]</ref>
*Carinthia (state)|Carinthia, German'' Kärnten'': etymologically related to the early Slavic medieval principality Carantania (Slovenian ''Karantanija'', German ''Karantanien''); a suggested etymology references a Celtic term for "stone" or "crag", while a popular etymology holds that the name means "land of friends"
*Lower Austria, German ''Nieder-Österreich'': the lower part (lower in height) of the original territory of Austria ('the eastern country'), as opposed to Upper Austria; also called ''Österreich unter der Enns'' "Austria below the (river) Enns (river)|Enns"
*Salzburg (state)|Salzburg: after the city of Salzburg (literally "salt castle"), which takes its name from the salt mines that existed there during the Middle Ages
*Styria, German ''Steiermark'': after the castle of Steyr; in the high Middle Ages, it formed a Marches|march of the Holy Roman Empire, hence ''-mark''
*County of Tyrol|Tirol: after the Tirol Castle near Meran
*Upper Austria, German ''Ober-Österreich'': the upper (physically higher) part of the original territory of Austria, as opposed to Lower Austria; also called ''Österreich ob der Enns'' "Austria above the (river) Enns"
*Vienna, German ''Wien'': from Celtic ''Vindobona'' (''vindo'' "white" + ''bona'' "foundation, fort")
*Vorarlberg, literally "in front of the Arlberg", takes its name from the Arlberg, a mountain (German: ''Berg'') with a high mountain pass, characterised by ''Arle'', a local German term for "mountain pine".

Belgium

=Regions=
*Brussels, Dutch ''Brussel'', French ''Bruxelles'' (the capital city, outside any province; also Belgium's third region): medieval Dutch ''broek'' 'bog' + ''zele'' (in many place names in the Low Countries="habitation using thatching")
*Flanders, Dutch ''Vlaanderen'', French ''Flandre(s)'': plural of a terrain type; or "flooded land"; or a compound Flemish ''vlakte'' "plain" and ''wanderen'' "to wander".<ref>

</ref> The name extended from the historical county (about half lost to French and Dutch neighbours; the rest roughly made up two administrative provinces, East Flanders and West Flanders; in French ''les Flandres'', plural) to the whole Dutch-speaking, majority part of Belgium (French ''la Flandre'', singular)
*Wallonia, French ''Wallonie'': from the (Romanized (Germano-) Celtic, now Francophone) Walloon people: as in many European countries, so named by Germanic neighbours; meaning: "strangers". Compare "Wales" #United Kingdom|below.

=Provinces=
*Liège (city)|Liège: of disputed etymology. The name ''Liège'' may have the same origin as the ancient name of Paris, i.e. ''Lutetia''; the German form, ''Lüttich'', suggests this. Liège and Lutetia would both derive from Latin language|Latin ''lucotætia'', "marsh" or "mud". Another suggestion derives the names from Latin ''Lætica'', "colony", or ''Leudica'', "free". Alternatively, the Latin ''Leudica'' meaning "public place" may have given rise to the Walloon language|Walloon ''Lîdje'' and thence to ''Liège''. Note that the name appeared in written form as ''Liége'' (with an acute accent) until the 1950s.

*Acadia (French ''Acadie''): origin disputed:
**# Credited to Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano, who first named a region around Chesapeake Bay ''Archadia'' (Arcadia) in 1524 because of "the beauty of its trees", according to his diary. Cartographers began using the name ''Arcadia'' to refer to areas progressively farther north until it referred to the French holdings in maritime Canada (particularly Nova Scotia). The ''-r-'' also began to disappear from the name on early maps, resulting in the current ''Acadia''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040802234006/http://www.billcasselman.com/canadian_food_words/acadia_one.htm Acadia: Origin of the Word by Bill Casselman]</ref>
**# Possibly derived from the Míkmaq language|Míkmaq word ''akatik'', pronounced roughly "agadik", meaning "place", which French-speakers spelled as ''-cadie'' in place names such as Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia|Shubenacadie and Tracadie, New Brunswick|Tracadie, possibly coincidentally.<ref>[http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/prov_e.php#ns Provinces and Territories – The origins of their names] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604204017/http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/prov_e.php |date=4 June 2008 </ref>

Chile

=Regions=
Roman numerals originally identified the regions in order from north to south (except Santiago). With the establishment of Arica-Parinacota Region|Arica-Parinacota and Los Ríos Region in 2007 the numbers no longer reflect the regions' positions.

*Maule Region (Spanish ''VII Región del Maule''): named after the Maule River.
*Biobío Region (Spanish ''VIII Región del Biobío''): named after the Bío-Bío River.
*Los Ríos Region (Spanish ''XIV Región de los Ríos''): refers to the river systems of Valdivia River|Valdivia and Bueno River|Bueno and to the nickname of the city of Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia. The name may also reflect the name of Los Lagos Region (Spanish for Region of the Lakes) from which Los Ríos split away.
*Aisén Region, sometimes also spelled Aysén (Spanish ''XI Región Aisén del General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo''): The name Aisén may come from the Huilliche word ''achen'', meaning "to crumble". Another theory suggests that the Chonos culture used the word to mean "going more to the interior", in reference to the Aisén Fjord|Fjord of Aisén that stretches east from the Moraleda Channel|Moraleda strait.
*Magallanes y Antártica Chilena Region (Spanish ''XII Región de Magallanes y de la Antártica Chilena''): named in honour of Ferdinand Magellan, the Strait of Magellan and the city of Punta Arenas, formerly called ''Magallanes''.

Czech Republic
File:Czech Rep. - Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia III (en).png|thumb|right|Map of the Czech Republic with traditional regions and current administrative regions

=Historical regions=
*Czechia, geographic name of the Czech Republic (''Česko'' in Czech). From old Czech language|Czech ''Czech'' (nationality), later written ''Čech''. Until 19th century referred predominantly to Bohemia only, later the meaning has been extended to all Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia). Traditionally traced to a Forefather Čech, who brought the Czechs into Bohemia.
*Bohemia: "Land of the Boii", a Celtic tribe of the region. The ultimate etymology of ''Boii'' is uncertain, but has been connected to PIE|Proto-Indo-European roots meaning "cow" and "warrior"
*Moravia: "Land of the Morava river, Central Europe|Morava"
*Silesia – from the holy Silesian mountain of Sleza|Ślęża
*Sudetenland – from the Sudetes|Sudeten mountains

Denmark
*Bornholm: The Old Danish form, ''Burghændeholm'' shows derivation with the suffix ''-und'' from ''burgh'' "fortress": "provided with a fortress", later combined with ''holm'', "island".<ref>Jørgensen, Bent, ''Stednavneordbog''. Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 1994. P. 41</ref> The similarity with the Germanic Burgundian tribe whose name has the same etymology and which may or may not have originated in Scandinavia, can be purely coincidental since the derivation is quite basic in meaning.
*Copenhagen (lang-da|København): The Old Danish form, ''Køpmannæhafn''<ref name="Jørgensen, Bent 1994. P. 170">Jørgensen, Bent, ''Stednavneordbog''. Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 1994. P. 170</ref> shows the older genitive plural ''køpmannæ'' of ''køpman'', "merchant", coupled with ''hafn'', "harbor", producing the meaning "merchants' harbour".<ref name="Jørgensen, Bent 1994. P. 170"/> It has entered English via the (Low) German ''Kopenhagen''.
*Danish Virgin Islands, a former territory: See #United Kingdom|British Virgin Islands below.
*Faroe Islands (lang-da|Færøerne, lang-fo|Føroyar): From Old Norse ''Færeyjar'' – literally, "Sheep Islands", from their dense population of sheep. Another theory suggests that the lexeme ''fær'' instead derives from Celtic and means "distant".Citation needed|date=October 2008
*Greenland (lang-da|Grønland): From Old Norse ''Grœnland'', literally, "green land"; so named by Erik the Red to induce settlement there. Kalaallisut language|Greenlandic-speakers use the name ''Kalaallit Nunaat'', meaning "Land of the Greenlanders"
*Jutland (lang-da|Jylland; lang-de|Jütland): From Old Danish ''Jutland'',<ref name="Jørgensen, Bent 1994. P. 148">Jørgensen, Bent, ''Stednavneordbog''. Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 1994. P. 148</ref> derived from the tribal name of the Jutes, combined with ''land'' "land".<ref name="Jørgensen, Bent 1994. P. 148"/>
*Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand (lang-da|Sjælland): Old Icelandic ''Selund'', Latin rendering ''Selon'', Old Danish ''Sialand''.<ref name="Jørgensen, Bent 1994. P. 249">Jørgensen, Bent, ''Stednavneordbog''. Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 1994. P. 249</ref> A somewhat later form, now poetic, is ''Sjølund''. The oldest forms with the single l and the original vowel reveal that the name is derived with the suffix ''-und'' (cf. Bornholm above) from Old Danish ''*sial'' meaning either "seal" or "furrow": "provided with seals" or "provided with furrows", referring either to populations of seals or inlets from the sea.<ref name="Jørgensen, Bent 1994. P. 249"/> The suffix has later been reinterpreted as the lexeme ''land'' "land.<ref name="Jørgensen, Bent 1994. P. 249"/>

*Põlva: from Estonian language|Estonian ''põlv'' – "knee". According to a legend, a virgin was once bricked in a church wall on her knees. According to another version, the Tartu-Võru and Kanepi-Räpina roads form a curve, shaped like a knee.

*Saaremaa: from Estonian language|Estonian ''saar'' – "island", meaning "island-land".

*Virumaa: from several Finnic languages ''virukas'' – "big" or "strong", or ''vire'' "sharp" or "penetrating" (for wind), meaning "land of the strong / big" or "land of the sharp / penetrating winds". (In Finnish, the words for Estonia and Estonians derive from Virumaa – ''Viro'' and ''virolaiset''.)

Finland
*Helsinki: The Swedish name ''lang|sv|Helsingfors'' (IPA-sv|hɛlsɪŋˈfɔrs| or IPA-sv|hɛlsɪŋˈfɔʂː|) represents the original official name of the city of Helsinki (in the very beginning, in the form 'Hellssingeforss'). The Finnish language form of the city's name probably originates from 'Helsinga' and similar names used for the river currently known as Vantaanjoki, as documented as early as the 14th century. ''Helsinki'' (pronounced with the stress on the first syllable: IPA-fi|ˈhelsiŋki|), refers to the city in all languages except Swedish and Norwegian. ''Helsingfors'' comes from the name of the surrounding parish, ''Helsinge'' (source for Finnish ''Helsinki'') and the rapids (in Swedish: ''fors''), which flowed through the original village. The name ''Helsinge'' possibly originated with medieval Swedish settlers who came from Hälsingland in Sweden. Another possible derivation looks to the Swedish word ''hals'' (neck), referring to the narrowest part of the river, i.e. the rapids.<ref>cite web|url=http://veta.yle.fi/svenskfinland/artikel.php?id=23&subject=mellannyland |title=Utbildning & Vetenskap: Svenskfinland |publisher=Veta.yle.fi |date= |accessdate=8 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512081641/http://veta.yle.fi/svenskfinland/artikel.php?id=23&subject=mellannyland |archivedate=12 May 2008 |df=

*Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia (or in Swedish: ''Österbotten'') – "Eastern Bothnia". Bothnia is a Latinization of Old Norse ''botn'',<ref>http://runeberg.org/svetym/0146.html</ref> meaning "bottom". The name ''botn'' was applied to the Gulf of Bothnia as ''Helsingjabotn'' in Old Norse, after Hälsingland, which at the time referred to the coastland west of the gulf. Later, ''botten'' was applied to the regions Västerbotten on the western side and Ostrobothnia (region)|Österbotten the eastern side ("East Bottom" and "West Bottom"). The Finnish name of Österbotten, ''Pohjanmaa'', or "Pohja"-land, gives a hint as to the meaning in both languages: ''pohja'' means both "bottom" and "north".
*Åland – "Waterland", from the proposed Germanic root ''*ahw-'', cognate with Latin language|Latin ''aqua'' and meaning "water".Citation needed|date=September 2011 ''Ahvenanmaa'', its Finnish language|Finnish name means "Land of European perch|Perch" and is partially borrowed, partially folk etymology|folk-etymologized from Germanic.Citation needed|date=September 2011

France

=Historic regions=
Most modern French Departments of France|départements take their names from local geographical features: usually rivers, occasionally mountain ranges or coasts. Thus most such names have a self-evident immediate origin: even non-speakers of French can deduce them with a minimum of geographical knowledge. The traditional provinces and regions (of any period) often bear names with richer but more obscure histories.

*Alsace – from Latin ''Alsatia'', a Latinised form of the Germanic name that also yields Old High German ''El-sasz'', allegedly meaning "foreign settlement" (according to the OED article on "Alsatia"<ref>cite book

* Artois – from Latin ''Atrebatensis'', adjectival form derived the Belgic tribe Atrebates, whose name comes from ''*ad-treb-ates'', meaning 'inhabitants', based on the Celtic root ''treb-'' 'building', 'home' (cf. Old Irish ''treb'' 'building', 'farm', Welsh ''tref'' 'building', Middle Breton ''treff'' 'city', toponyms in ''Tre-'', Occitan language|Provençal ''trevar'' 'to live in a house or in a village').<ref>Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise: une approche linguistique du vieux-celtique continental'', éditions Errance 2003. p. 300.</ref>  According to Alexander MacBain (d. 1907),<ref name="ReferenceA">MacBain, Alexander.

* Brittany|Brittany (''Bretagne'') – area occupied by refugee Britons (historic)|Britons from Roman Empire|Roman Britain (''Britannia'') ''circa'' 500 AD
* Burgundy (region)|Burgundy (''Bourgogne'') – part of the land settled by the East Germanic Burgundians, who possibly originated on the island now known as Bornholm. Speakers of Old Norse knew the island as ''Borgundarholm'', and in ancient Danish especially the island's name appears as ''Borghand'' or ''Borghund''; these names relate to Old Norse ''borg'' "height" and ''bjarg/berg'' "mountain, rock", as the island rises high from the sea.<ref>Mallory, J.P. and D.Q.

*Normandy|Normandy (''Normandie'') – land settled by Viking ''Northmen'' in the early 10th century
*Occitania, from ''Occitània'' in Occitan. From medieval Latin ''Occitania'' (approximately since 1290). The first part of the name, ''Occ-'', is from Occitan ''[lenga d']òc'' or Italian ''[lingua d']oc'' (i.e. "Language of Òc"), a name given to the Occitan language by Dante according to its way of saying "yes" (''òc''). The ending ''-itania'' is probably an imitation of the old Latin name ''[Aqu]itania''.
*Provence – from Latin ''provincia'' (province), short for ''Provincia Narbonensis'', the Roman province located in present-day southern France.
*Savoy – of unknown origin, but dating to the days of the Kingdom of Burgundy

Germany

=States of Germany|States=
*Baden-Württemberg: formed by combining the names of the former states of Baden and of Württemberg.
**Baden: after the city of Baden-Baden, formerly ''Baden'', the name became reduplicated to distinguish it from the state (as in "Baden in Baden"). The name means "baths", after the springs in the city.
**Württemberg: after Württemberg Castle, which stood on the Württemberg, a hill in Stuttgart, formerly ''Wirtemberg'', further origin uncertain (''-berg'' means "mountain")
*Bavaria (German ''Bayern''): the state of Bavaria developed out of the tribe of the Baiuvarii, who probably gained their name from the land of Bohemia
*Brandenburg: after the city of Brandenburg (town)|Brandenburg. The earlier Slavic language|Slavic name of the castle (''Burg'') of Brandenburg appears as ''Branibor'' (Slavic for "Branim's forest", where ''bor'' means "a dense forest").
*Hamburg: from the 9th-century name ''Hammaburg'', where ''Hamma'' has multiple conflicting interpretations, but ''burg'' means "castle".
*Hesse: after the tribe of the Chatti
*Lower Saxony (German ''Niedersachsen''): after the tribe of the Saxons. "Lower Saxony" became differentiated in modern times from the state of Saxony to its southeast. The word "lower" reflects Lower Saxony's location in the lowlands of the North German Plain, as opposed to Saxony, which has a higher elevation. See below for etymology of "Saxony".
*Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (German language|German) ''Mecklenburg-Vorpommern''): formed geographically by joining Mecklenburg with the western part of Pomerania, also called ''Hither Pomerania''.
**Mecklenburg takes its name from Mecklenburg Castle in Dorf Mecklenburg (''Burg'' means "castle" in German, the first part means "big": compare Middle Low German ''mekel'', cognate with English ''mickle''—"big castle").
**''Pomerania'' (German ''Pommern'') comes from Slavic languages|Slavic roots meaning "near the sea" (in Slavic languages ''more'' means "sea"): the standard modern Polish name for the region, ''Pomorze'', demonstrates this well.
* North Rhine-Westphalia (German ''Nordrhein-Westfalen'')—geographically formed by joining the northern part of the Rhineland (after the River Rhine) with Westphalia.
** The name of the Rhine derives from Gaulish ''Renos'', and ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root *''reie-'' ("to move, flow, run"); words like ''river'' and ''run'' share the same root.<ref name=etym>cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Rhine |title=Rhine |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=10 February 2009 |publisher=Douglas Harper |date=November 2001</ref> The Reno River in Italy shares the same etymology.<!--Maybe not the Gaulic bit though--> The spelling with -h- suggests a borrowing from the Greek form of the name, ''Rhenos'',<ref name=etym/> seen also in ''rheos'', "stream", and ''rhein'', "to flow".
** Westphalia formed the westernmost subdivision of the Saxons|Saxon tribe; the origin of the second part (''-falen'' in German) remains unknown
* Rhineland-Palatinate (German ''Rheinland-Pfalz''): formed geographically by joining parts of the Rhineland (see above under North Rhine-Westphalia) with the Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate, formerly a palatine county located near the Rhine, meaning that its count administered a palace of the Holy Roman Emperor.
** The word Palatinate derives from Latin ''palatinus'' "imperial", from ''palatium'' "palace", after the location of the palace of the Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus|Augustus on the Palatine Hill in Rome
*Saarland: after the Saar River
*Saxony (German ''Sachsen''): land of the Saxons (possibly the "sword-folk"). The state of Saxony developed out of the Saxon tribe, which principally inhabited present-day Lower Saxony; during the Middle Ages and early modern times, the name migrated to the current location of the state of Saxony
*Saxony-Anhalt (German, ''Sachsen-Anhalt''): formed geographically by joining the Prussian Province of Saxony (see above under Saxony) with Anhalt
**Anhalt takes its name from Anhalt Castle near Harzgerode; the origin of the name of the castle remains unknown
*Schleswig-Holstein: created by joining Schleswig and Holstein.
**Schleswig takes its name from the City of Schleswig, which in turn derives its name from the Schlei bay and the Low German word ''wig'' for "trading place".
** "Holstein" comes from a Saxon people|Saxon subtribe named, in Latin, Holcetae, whose means "dwellers in the wood" (Northern Low Saxon: ''Hol(t)saten''; German: ''Holzsassen'').
* Thuringia (German ''Thüringen'') – after the tribe of the Thuringii.

=Historic regions=
* Braunschweig (region)|Brunswick (German: ''Braunschweig''): from the town of Braunschweig|Brunswick, possibly originating as "Bruno's ''wik''" (Bruno's marketplace) (with reference to the legendary founder Bruno, Duke of Saxony, died 880, or another Bruno) or as "burnt ''wik''"); the High German form ''Braunschweig'' is an erroneous translation of the original Low German language|Low German ''Brunswick''
* Franconia (German: ''Franken''): from the traditional designation "Franks", referring especially to the Eastern Francia|Kingdom of the East Franks. The name refers to those areas east of the Rhine that were first occupied by the Franks, as opposed to areas that were held by the Swabians, Bavarians or Saxons.
* Province of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern: ultimately from the names of Hohenzollern Castle and its location, Mount Hohenzollern (known locally as ''Zoller'' or ''Zollern''). The lexeme ''hoh''/''hohen'' in German means "high/height".
*Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg, after the city of Oldenburg, first recorded in 1108 as the town of ''Aldenburg'', subsequently also a county, duchy, grand duchy and republic, meaning "old castle"
*Prussia (German: ''Preußen'') – (at times historically connected with Germany or with parts thereof): from the people known as the Old Prussians|Prussians, a grouping of western Balts|Balt peoples whose collective name (German: ''Prussen'' or anciently ''Pruzzen'') may possibly derive from an Indo-European languages|Indo-European root meaning "swamp": see Prussian people; for political reasons, the electors of Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg decided to name themselves kings of Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia in the 18th century; in this way, they transferred the name of the remote eastern region to a major German state
* Swabia (German: ''Schwaben'' or ''Schwabenland''): after the tribe of the Suebi whose name may come from Proto-Germanic *''swēbaz'' based on the Proto-Germanic Root (linguistics)|root *''swē-'' meaning "one's own" [people],<ref name="urnordisk">

Indonesia
*Aceh: name of the Acehnese people|coastal people of the area (the main group inhabiting the inland area are the Gayo people).
*Banten: named in the honor of the former Banten Sultanate, which ruled over the region from 16th to the 18th centuries and became one of the main fronts of opposition against the colonial might of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).
*Bengkulu: named after the Bengkulu river, which passes through the area of the province. The name of ''Bengkulu'' itself comes from the Malay word ''bangkai'' meaning "corpse", and ''hulu'' meaning "river-source"—it refers to the story that in the past the area near the source of the river Bengkulu had often served as a battlefield—tribes and clans battled each other on the river banks leaving them full of corpses and blood.
*Gorontalo (province)|Gorontalo: from the Dutch version of the local phrase ''hulontalo'', meaning "lands surrounded by water" due to the many lakes and rivers formerly in the area
*Irian Jaya: The name ''Irian'' is said to come from the Biak language.Citation needed|date=March 2007 An alternative etymology for ''Irian'' stems from the acronym ''Ikut Republik Indonesia, Anti Nederland'' ("Join/Follow the Republic of Indonesia, rejecting The Netherlands) (see the article on the Papua (province)|Province of Papua—as of|2009|lc=on the official Indonesian and internationally recognized name for ''Irian Jaya'').Citation needed|date=March 2007 The word ''jaya'' means "victory" or "glorious" in Indonesian language|Indonesian, referring to the Indonesian victory over the colonisers who controlled the area both militarily and diplomatically, a sign of pride as the Indonesians showed themselves capable not only of defending their lands from the Dutch attempt to reestablish colonial rule after World War II, but also of taking over lands not included in the 1945 proclamation or the 1950 reunification, specifically ''Irian Jaya' or the Province of Papua.
*Jakarta: from the Javanese words ''jaya'' (meaning "victory") and ''karta'' (meaning "glory"), which make up the phrase "victorious & glorious; this refers to the victory of Prince Pati Unus (also known as Fatahillah) of the Demak Sultanate in his campaign to defeat the rival Malakka Sultanate of the Malay peninsula and Samudera Pasai Sultanate of Aceh region in the mid-16th century. The "glorious victory" also refers to the event of Indonesian Proclamation of Independence on 17 August 1945 which took place in the city.
*Jambi: the province takes its name from the historical Jambi Sultanate which ruled over the area from the 17th to the 19th centuries
*Lampung: From the word "Lambung" in the Old Malay phrase ''anjak Lambung'', which means "descended from the heights". This refers to the ancestral riddle of the Lampung people, who allegedly had ancestors "descended from the heights". The "heights" reference the southernmost part of the Barisan mountain range that runs through all the western part of the Lampung province.
*Nusa Tenggara: from ''Nusa'' meaning "islands" (referring to the Lesser Sunda Islands that make up the area) and ''tenggara'' meaning "south-east" (referring to the position of the area within the country).
*Sumatra: from Ibn Battuta's 14th-century pronunciation of the name of the Pasai|Samudra Kingdom (13th to 15th centuries CE)
*Yogyakarta: From 'Jogja' and 'Karta'. Jogja is a Javanised version of a Sanskrit word, 'Ayodhya', the prefix A- meaning 'not' and 'Yodhya' is synonymous to Hindi 'Yuddha', meaning battle, combat, fight, or war. Thus Ayodhya, which later Javanised into Jogja, meant 'The place of no fight' or in simpler interpretation, peaceful. This may refer to the geographic location of Jogjakarta, being fortified naturally by the Java Sea to the South, the Merapi Mountain to the north, the Gunung Sewu Karst Mountains to the east and Progo River to the west where it would be the perfect fortress of peace, and even more supported as a breeding place of peaceful life with its rich and fertile volcanic land and rivers, sourcing up to the majestic Merapi. The word 'Karta' means glory, referring to a hope that this city would bring glory to its people.

Iran (Persia)
*Lorestan: land of the Lurs

Italy
*Campania: different interpretations: 1) from the Latin ''campania'' (countryside, plain, battlefield); compare Champagne (province)|Champagne in France. 2) from the ethnonym "campani", osci|Oscan italic people who lived in the Apennines mountains in the Southern Italy before the Magna Graecia|Greek colonization. Greek ancient sources record the term "campani" before the Roman colonization, putting doubts on the Latin interpretation. Campania is likely derived from the toponym of the ancient city of Capua (from *Campuam/Kampuam = *Campania) which was the most important city in the region during the oscan and etruscan period.
*Friuli: from the Latin ''Forum Julii'' (The market of Julius), which at the beginning referred only to the city of Cividale, founded by Julius Caesar and then extended to the whole region.
*Latium (in modern Italian: ''Lazio''): land of the early Ancient Italic peoples|Italic inhabitants known as Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins, in their turn popularly associated with the mythological King Latinus [in turn, "Latins" (in Latin, ''Latīnī'')—as well as the name of King ''Latīnus'' (simply the singular of the same name)—clearly derived their names from ''Latium'' by means of the ethnic suffix ''-īnus'', with the obvious meaning of "inhabitant(s) of Latium", which makes this etymology ridiculously circular, but let that serve as a warning to the reader as to the quality of this and other etymologies on this page]. Ovid hints at perhaps a slightly more sophisticated folk etymology, with a legend of the naming of Latium after Saturn (mythology)|Saturn ''latente deo'' (as a god in hiding) after he allegedly fled to Italy following his expulsion by Jupiter (god)|Jupiter.  Modern linguists postulate origins in a Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) root ''*stela-'' (to spread, extend), expressing the idea of "flat land" (in contrast to the local Sabine high country).

*Oltenia – from the river Olt River|Olt, called ''Alutus'' by the Romans, possibly from Latin ''lutum'', meaning "mud" or "clay".
*Transylvania – "beyond the woods"—i.e., from Hungary
**''Ardeal'' – possibly a borrowing of the Hungarian name Erdély, like the Romani name ''Ardyalo''—speakers of old Hungarian pronounced ''Erdély'' as ''Erdél''. The initial Hungarian "e-" occasionally changes to "a-" in Romanian (compare Hungarian ''egres'' "gooseberry" and ''Egyed'', which became ''agriş'' and ''Adjud'' in Romanian). However, the ending '-eal' in Romanian does not suggest a Romanian borrowing from Hungarian. In parallel examples, Hungarian ''-ely'' becomes ''-ei'' in Romanian. But when Hungarian adopts a word from Romanian, "a" usually becomes "e": ''Andreas'' becomes ''Endre'', the Latin ''ager'' becomes ''eger'', etc. Thus the word ''Ardeal'' could become ''Erdély''. The linguist Josep Lad Pic determinedCitation needed|date=January 2010 that the word "Ardeal" has an Indo-European origin, while the words ''Erdely'' and ''Erdo'' do not. The Proto-Indo-European root *arde ("to grow", "high") manifests itself in the Old Indian ''árdhuka'' ("prospering"), and in Latin ''arduus'' ("high"). In Celtic Gaul, ''Arduenna silva'' parallels the English "Forest of Arden" and the Ardennes Woods in Belgium. In Romanian, ''deal'' means "hill" and ''ardica'' "to grow, high, prosperous".
*Wallachia – "land of the Romance-speaking people"

The village stands on the bank of the Argun River (Caucasus)|Argun River, near Grozny. Another theory derives the name from ''chechenit' sya'', "to talk mincingly".<ref>Webster's third international dictionary; Merriam-Webster 1993, p.381.</ref> Max Vasmer|Vasmer suggests a Kabardian language|Kabardian origin: ''šešen''.<ref>cite book|last=Vasmer|first=Max|authorlink=Max Vasmer|title=Russisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch|volume=3|year=1958|publisher=Carl Winter|location=Heidelberg|language=German|pages=334|quote=</ref> The native term, ''Noxçi'', comes from ''nexça'' (sheep cheese), ''nox'' (plow) or from the prophet Noah (''Nox'' in Chechen).
*Dagestan: the word ''Daghestan'' or ''Daghistan'' (lang-av|Дагъистан; Arabic and lang-fa|داغستان) means "country of mountains"; it derives from the Turkic word ''dağ'', meaning "mountain" and the Persian suffix -stan|-''stan'' meaning "land of".

* Cape Province|Cape of Good Hope: named after the Cape of Good Hope, where Cape Town stands.

=After 1994=
File:Map of South Africa with English labels.svg|right|thumb|200px|Current map of South African provinces
* Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Western Cape: from the Cape of Good Hope, the site of the first European settlement in today's South Africa, which would give its name to Cape Town, Cape Colony, and the former Cape Province, of which each of the three named provinces originally formed a part.
* Free State (province)|Free State: the popular contraction of this province's historic predecessor, the Orange Free State.
* Gauteng: The Sesotho language|Sesotho name for the province's and country's largest city of Johannesburg. The literal meaning, "Place of Gold", refers to the area's large gold-mining industry.
* KwaZulu-Natal: a combination of the names of the two entities that merged to form the modern province:
** KwaZulu: a bantustan formed in the apartheid era, ostensibly as a "homeland" for the Zulu people|Zulu
** Natal Province|Natal: Portuguese for "Christmas". The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama named the area: he landed on the coast of the future KwaZulu-Natal on Christmas Day in 1497.
* Limpopo: the Limpopo River forms the province's and the country's most northern boundary.
* Mpumalanga: "east", or more literally, "the place where the sun rises", in several Nguni languages, among them Swazi language|Swazi, Xhosa language|Xhosa, and Zulu language|Zulu. Refers to the province's location in the north-east of South Africa.
* North West (South African province)|North West: From its geographic position, in the north of the country and west of the main population-centre of Gauteng.

Spain
*Andalusia: from the Arabic name (Al-Andalus, with several suggested etymologies) formerly applied to the whole Iberian Peninsula
*Aragon: from the Aragon River, that gave its name to the county of Aragon, one of the little Christian polities that resisted Islamic rule in Spain during its greatest extent (see Reconquista)
*Asturias: the land of the Astures, an early people of north-west Spain
*Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country (lang-eu|Euskal Herria): from the ancient tribe of the Vascones, whose name became an ethnonym in the Middle Ages. The Basque name derives from ''Euskara'' (the autochthonous name for the Basque language).
**Álava (lang-eu|Araba): of uncertain etymology. Various theories see it deriving from a Roman town called ''Alba'', from several prossible Basque etymologies and even from Arabs (who, however, never occupied the province for long). A chronicle of 905 uses the form ''Arba'', but later the word commonly appears as ''Alaba'' or ''Alava''.
**Biscay (lang-eu|Bizkaia, lang-es|Vizcaya): variant of ''bizkarra'' ("shoulder", "back" or, in this case, "mountain range" in Basque)
**Guipuscoa (lang-eu|Gipuzkoa, lang-es|Guipúzcoa): of unknown etymology. Old documents sometimes use the variant ''Ipuscoa''.
*Cantabria: from the Cantabri, a mountain people defeated by the Roman Empire|Romans only after a great military effort (Cantabrian Wars, 29 – 19 BC). Celtologists have suggested a derivation from the Celtic languages|Celtic root ''cant-'', meaning "rock" or "stone", and from the suffix ''-abr'', used frequently in Celtic regions. From this we can deduce that the word "cantabrus" means "dwelling in the mountains", referring to the rugged terrain of Cantabria. Another suggestion derives ''Cantabria'' from the Celtic ''Kant'' ("mountain" or "rock") and ''Iber'' (the river Ebro), thus "The Mountains of the Ebro". Spaniards also call this region ''La Montaña'' ("The Mountain"), but usually call the Bay of Biscay the Cantabrian Sea.
*Castile (historical region)|Castile: the Spanish/Castilian name ''Castilla'' reflects the Spanish ''castillo'' ("castle") and the Latin ''castellum'' ("fort" or "fortress") with reference to numerous forts or castles erected by King Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso I for the defence of the area
*Catalonia: from the ''castlà'' ("castellan") class who governed the nascent feudal Catalonia from their castles in the 11th and 12th centuries. (Compare the etymology of "Castile (historical region)|Castile".) Other parallel theories exist: Lafont (1986) says ''Catalunya'' could come from Arabic ''Qalat-uniyya'' (''Qalat'' means "castle" and ''-uniyya'' operates as a collective suffix) because medieval Catalonia formed a border country with a lot of castles in front of the Muslim and Arabized zone of the Iberic peninsula. Some texts suggest that the name ''Catalunya'' derives from "Gauta-landia": land of the Goths, or "Goth-Alania" meaning "Land of the Goths and Alans"<ref>[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f8/v1f8a013.html Alans, Encyclopædia Iranica]</ref> through Arabian ''*Cotelanuyya'' [cf. Andalusia, land of the Vandals], as the Visigoths and Alans invaded and divided Iberia between themselves, agreeing to rule some parts together, with the region of Catalunya going to the Visigoths. Additionally, the Visigothic kingdom of Catalonia may have taken its name from that of the original homeland of the Visigoths, "Gotland". Joan Coromines|Coromines suggests an Iberian origin: ''Laietani'' (latinization of Iberian ''laiezken'') > ''*laketani'' > ''laketans'' > Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesized as ''catelans'' > ''catalans'', re-inforced by ''castellani'' (with an Epenthesis|epenthetic ''s'' according to Coromines). Another theory suggests ''*kaste-lan'' as the Iberian name, later Latinized as ''castellani'' (an Iberian tribe in northern Catalonia according to Ptolemy); then the name would have evolved into ''*catellani'' > ''*catelans'' > ''*Catalans''.
*Extremadura: from Medieval Latin ''Extrema Dorii'' (literally, "extremes of the Douro river"), referring to the territories south of the Douro basin; or from an Old Castilian Spanish|Castilian word used to designate the further territories controlled by the Christians (see Reconquista)
*Gallaecia|Galicia: from Latin ''Gallaecia'', the name of the province created in Roman Hispania by Diocletian in 298 CE. It derives from ''gallicoi'' or ''callicoi'', (''Galli'' or Celts).
*León (province)|León: the ancient Kingdom of León|kingdom and subsequent León (province)|province of León take their name from the city of León, León|León, whose name derives from its position as the base of a Roman legion (Latin ''legio'')
*Navarre (Spanish: ''Navarra'', Basque: ''Nafarroa''): from the Kingdom of Navarre. ''Navarra'' has been argued to have either a Basque or Romance etymology. In the first case it would come from ''nabar'' ("brownish, multicolor", also "plowshare"), in the second from ''nava'' ("river bank").
* La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja: speculatively interpreted as "red" from the redness of a prominent soil type in the area.<ref>

*Jersey: The Old Norse|Norse suffix ''-ey'' means "island" and is commonly found in the parts of Northern Europe where Norsemen established settlements.
