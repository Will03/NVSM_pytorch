In evolutionary biology, mimicry is an evolved resemblance between an organism and another object, often an organism of another species. Mimicry may evolve between different species, or between individuals of the same species. Often, mimicry functions to protect a species from predators, making it an antipredator adaptation.<ref>cite book | last=King | first=R. C. | last2=Stansfield | first2=W.

Etymology
Use of the word wikt:mimicry|mimicry dates to 1637. It etymology|derives from the Greek language|Greek term ''mimetikos'', "imitative", in turn from ''mimetos'', the verbal adjective of ''mimeisthai'', "to imitate". Originally used to describe people, "mimetic" was used in zoology from 1851, "mimicry" from 1861.<ref>cite web | title=Online Etymology Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=mimicry&searchmode=none| author=Douglas Harper | date=2007-10-06</ref>

Classification

Many types of mimicry have been described. An overview of each follows, highlighting the similarities and differences between the various forms. Classification is often based on function (biology)|function with respect to the mimic (e.g., avoiding harm). Some cases may belong to more than one class, e.g., automimicry and aggressive mimicry are not mutually exclusive, as one describes the species relationship between model and mimic, while the other describes the function for the mimic (obtaining food). The terminology used is not without debate and attempts to clarify have led to new terms being included. The term "masquerade" is sometimes used when the model is inanimate but it is differentiated from "crypsis" in its strict sense<ref>cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1981.tb01840.x|title=An overview of the relationships between mimicry and crypsis|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=16|pages=25–31|year=1981|last1=Endler|first1=John A.</ref> by the potential response of the signal receiver. In crypsis the receiver is assumed to not respond while a masquerader confuses the recognition system of the receiver that would otherwise seek the signaller. In the other forms of mimicry, the signal is not filtered out by the sensory system of the receiver.<ref>cite journal|doi=10.1080/00219266.1985.9654747|title=Crypsis and masquerade|journal=Journal of Biological Education|volume=19|issue=4|pages=268|year=2010|last1=Allen|first1=J. A.|last2=Cooper|first2=J. M.</ref> These are not mutually exclusive and in the evolution of wasp-like appearance, it has been argued that insects evolve to masquerade wasps since predatory wasps do not attack each other but this mimetic resemblance also deters vertebrate predators.<ref>Cite journal|last=Boppré|first=Michael|last2=Vane-Wright|first2=Richard I.|last3=Wickler|first3=Wolfgang|date=2017-01-01|title=A hypothesis to explain accuracy of wasp resemblances|journal=Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=73–81|doi=10.1002/ece3.2586|issn=2045-7758|pmc=5214283|pmid=28070276</ref>

File:Macroxiphus sp cricket.jpg|thumb|''Macroxiphus'' sp katydid mimics an antDefensive or protective mimicry takes place when organisms are able to avoid harmful encounters by deceiving enemies into treating them as something else.

The first three such cases discussed here entail mimicry of animals protected by warning coloration<!--both UK and US spelling-->:
* Batesian mimicry, where a harmless mimic poses as harmful.
* Müllerian mimicry, where two or more harmful species mutually advertising in biology|advertise themselves as harmful.
* Mertensian mimicry, where a deadly mimic resembles a less harmful but lesson-teaching model.

The fourth case, Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds resemble crops, involves humans as the agent of selection.

In Batesian mimicry the mimic shares signals similar to the model, but does not have the attribute that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing|sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in ''The Naturalist on the River Amazons'') was pioneering in this field of study.<ref>cite book | author=Bates, Henry W. |authorlink=Henry Walter Bates | year=1863 | title=The naturalist on the river Amazons | titlelink=The Naturalist on the River Amazons | publisher=Murray</ref><ref>cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=Henry W.|authorlink=Henry Walter Bates |year=1861 |title=Contributions to an insect fauna of the Amazon valley.

This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and the mimic occur, and where the model is more abundant than the mimic.<ref>cite book | author=Sterns & Hoekstra | title=Evolution: An Introduction |date= | edition=5th | page=464 |isbn= </ref> This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.

File:Heliconius mimicry.png|upright=<!--size for multiple image-->1.2|thumb|left|The ''Heliconius'' butterflies from the tropics of the Western Hemisphere are the classical model for Müllerian mimicry.<ref>cite journal | author=Meyer, A. | year=2006 | title=Repeating Patterns of Mimicry | journal=PLoS Biol | volume=4 | issue=10| page=e341 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040341 | pmid=17048984 | pmc=1617347</ref>

Müllerian mimicry, named for the German naturalist Fritz Müller, describes a situation where two or more species have similar warning or aposematic signals and both share genuine anti-predation attributes (e.g. being unpalatable). At first, Bates could not explain why this should be so—if both were harmful why did one need to mimic another? Müller put forward the first explanation for this phenomenon: if a common predator confuses two species, individuals in both those species are more likely to survive.<ref>cite journal | last1=Müller | first1=Fritz | year=1878 | title=Ueber die Vortheile der Mimicry bei Schmetterlingen | journal=Zoologischer Anzeiger | volume=1 | pages=54–55 </ref><ref>cite journal | last1=Müller | first1=F. | year=1879 | title=''Ituna'' and ''Thyridia''; a remarkable case of mimicry in butterflies (translated by Meldola, R.) | journal=Proclamations of the Entomological Society of London | volume=1879 | pages=20–29</ref> This type of mimicry is unique in several respects. Firstly, both the mimic and the model benefit from the interaction, which could thus be classified as Mutualism (biology)|mutualism in this respect. The signal receiver is also advantaged by this system, despite being deceived about species identity, as it avoids potentially harmful encounters. The usually clear distinction between mimic and model is also blurred. Where one species is scarce and another abundant, the rare species can be said to be the mimic. When both are present in similar numbers, however, it is more realistic to speak of each as a ''co-mimic'' than of distinct 'mimic' and 'model' species, as their warning signals tend to converge.<ref>cite web| author=Flannery, T.

The viceroy has subspecies with somewhat different coloration, each closely matching the local ''Danaus (genus)|Danaus'' species.

But if a predator dies, it cannot learning|learn to recognize a warning signal, e.g., bright colours in a certain pattern. In other words, there is no advantage in being aposematic for an organism that is likely to kill any predator it succeeds in poisoning; such an animal is better off being camouflaged, to avoid attacks altogether. If, however, there were some other species that were harmful but not deadly as well as aposematic, the predator could learn to recognize its particular warning colours and avoid such animals. A deadly species could then profit by mimicking the less dangerous aposematic organism if this reduces the number of attacks.<ref name=Hecht/><ref name=Sheppard/> The exception here, ignoring any chance of animals observational learning|learning by watching a conspecific die (see Jouventin ''et al.'' for a discussion of observational learning and mimicry),<ref>cite journal | last1=Jouventin | first1=P. | last2=Pasteur | first2=G. | last3=Cambefort | first3=J.

In this case, other organisms could benefit from this programming, and Batesian or Müllerian mimics of it could potentially evolve. In fact, it has been shown that some species do have an innate recognition of certain aposematic warnings.

Some harmless milk snake (''Lampropeltis triangulum'') subspecies, the moderately toxic false coral snakes (genus ''Erythrolamprus''), and the deadly coral snakes (genus ''Micrurus'') all have a red background color with black and white / yellow rings. In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly coral snakes are mimics, whereas the false coral snakes are the model.<ref name=Emsley/> It has also been suggested that this system could be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.<ref>cite journal |last1=Grobman |first1=Arnold B. |title=An Alternative Solution to the Coral Snake Mimic Problem (Reptilia, Serpentes, Elapidae) |journal=Journal of Herpetology |date=1978 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.2307/1563495 |jstor=1563495</ref>

Wasmannian
further|ant mimicry

In Erich Wasmann|Wasmannian mimicry, the mimic resembles a model that it inquiline|lives along with in a nest or colony. Most of the models here are eusociality|social insects such as ants, termites, bees and wasps.<ref>Wasmann, E. 1894. Kritisches Verzeichniss der myrmecophilin und termitophilen Arthropoden.

Vavilovian
Main|Vavilovian mimicry
File:Secale cereale.jpg|right|thumb|Rye is a secondary crop, originally being a mimetic weed of wheat.

Vavilovian mimicry is found in weeds that come to share characteristics with a Crop|domesticated plant through artificial selection.<ref name=Pasteur /> It is named after Russian botanist and geneticist Nikolai Vavilov.<ref name=Vavilov>cite journal | last1=Vavilov | first1=N. I. | year=1951 | title=The origin, variation, immunity and breeding of cultivated plants (translation by K. S. Chester) | journal=Chronica Botanica | volume=13 | pages=1–366</ref> Selection against the weed may occur either by manually killing the weed, or by separating its seeds from those of the crop by winnowing.

Vavilovian mimicry presents an illustration of unintentional (or rather 'anti-intentional') selective breeding|selection by man. Weeders do not want to select weeds and their seeds that look increasingly like cultivated plants, yet there is no other option. For example, early barnyard grass, ''Echinochloa oryzoides'', is a weed in rice fields and looks similar to rice; its seeds are often mixed in rice and have become difficult to separate through Vavilovian mimicry.<ref>cite journal | last1=Barrett | first1=S. | year=1983 | title=Mimicry in Plants | journal=Scientific American | volume=257 | issue=3| pages=76–83 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0987-76 | bibcode=1987SciAm.257c..76B </ref> Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves, as in the case of rye in wheat; Vavilov called these weed-crops ''secondary crops''.<ref name=Vavilov/>

Vavilovian mimicry can be classified as defensive mimicry, in that the weed mimics a protected species. This bears strong similarity to Batesian mimicry in that the weed does not share the properties that give the model its protection, and both the model and the dupe (in this case people) are harmed by its presence. There are some key differences, though; in Batesian mimicry, the model and signal receiver are enemies (the predator would eat the protected species if it could), whereas here the crop and its human growers are in a mutualistic relationship: the crop benefits from being dispersed and protected by people, despite being eaten by them. In fact, the crop's only "protection" relevant here is its usefulness to humans. Secondly, the weed is not eaten, but simply destroyed. The only motivation for killing the weed is its effect on crop yields. Finally, this type of mimicry does not occur in ecosystems unaltered by humans.

Gilbertian

Gilbertian mimicry involves only two species. The potential host (or prey) drives away its parasite (or predator) by mimicking it, the reverse of host-parasite aggressive mimicry. It was coined by Pasteur as a phrase for such rare mimicry systems,<ref name=Pasteur /> and is named after the American ecologist Lawrence E. Gilbert.<ref>L. E. Gilbert (1975) Ecological consequences of a coevolved mutualism between butterflies and plants. In L. E. Gilbert and P. H. Raven (eds.) ''Coevolution of Animal and Plants'' pp. 210–40. Austin and London, University of Texas Press.</ref>

Gilbertian mimicry occurs in the genus ''Passiflora''. The leaves of this plant contain toxins that deter herbivorous animals. However, some ''Heliconius'' butterfly larvae have evolved enzymes that break down these toxins, allowing them to specialist species|specialize on this genus. This has created further selection pressure on the host plants, which have evolved stipules that mimic mature ''Heliconius'' eggs near the point of hatching. These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near existing ones, which helps avoid exploitative intraspecific competition between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival. Most ''Heliconius'' larvae are cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalistic, meaning that on leaves older eggs hatch first and eat the new arrivals. Thus, it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies under selection pressure from these grazing herbivore enemies. In addition, the decoy eggs are also nectaries, attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps as a further defence.<ref name=Campbell>Campbell, N. A.

Browerian

This is the analogue of Batesian mimicry within a single species, and occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population. Examples include the Monarch butterfly|monarch and the Queen (butterfly)|queen from the Milkweed butterfly|Danainae subfamily, which feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. These species store toxins from its host plant, which are maintained even in the adult (imago) form. As levels of toxin vary depending on diet during the larval stage, some individuals are more toxic than others. Less palatable organisms, therefore, mimic more dangerous individuals, with their likeness already perfected.

This is not always the case, however. In sexually dimorphic species, one sex may be more of a threat than the other, which could mimic the protected sex. Evidence for this possibility is provided by the behaviour of a monkey from Gabon, which regularly ate male moths of the genus ''Anaphe'', but promptly stopped after it tasted a noxious female.<ref>cite journal | last1=Bigot | first1=L. | last2=Jouventin | first2=P. | year=1974 | title=Quelques expériences de comestibilité de Lépidoptères gabonais faites avec le mandrill, le cercocèbe à joues grises et le garde-bœufs |language=fr | journal=Terre Vie | volume=28 | issue=| pages=521–43 </ref>

=Aggressive=
Main|Aggressive mimicry

Predators

Aggressive mimicry is found in predators or parasites that share some of the characteristics of a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey or host (biology)|host; this can be compared with the story of the wolf in sheep's clothing as long as it is understood that no conscious deceptive intent is involved. The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can be treated as a form of predator,<ref name=Ecology>Begon, M.; Townsend, C.; Harper, J. (1996) ''Ecology: Individuals, populations and communities'' (third edition) Blackwell Science, London</ref> host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.

The mimic may have a particular significance for duped prey.<!-- anglerfish example (see Wickler and also The Compleat Angler: Aggressive Mimicry in an Antennariid Anglerfish. Theodore W. Pietsch; David  B. Grobecker  Science > New Series, Vol. 201, no. 4353 (July, 1978), pp. 369–370 --> One such case is spiders, amongst which aggressive mimicry is quite common both in luring prey and disguising stealthily approaching predators.<ref>cite journal | last1=Jackson | first1=R. R. | year=1995 | title=Eight-legged tricksters: Spiders that specialize at catching other spiders | journal=BioScience | volume=42 | issue=8| pages=590–98 |jstor=1311924 | doi=10.2307/1311924</ref> One case is the golden orb weaver (''Nephila clavipes''), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colours were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow-pigmented webs with danger. Yellow is the colour of many nectar-bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worthwhile. Another form of mimicry is based not on colour but pattern. Species such as the silver argiope (''Argiope argentata'') employ prominent patterns in the middle of their webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by the ability  of bees to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.<ref>cite journal | last1=Craig | first1=C.

Another case is where males are lured towards what seems to be a sexually receptive female. The model in this situation is the same species as the dupe. Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's investigation of female firefly|fireflies of the genus ''Photuris (genus)|Photuris'' revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus ''Photinus (beetle)|Photinus'' use as a mating signal.<ref>Lloyd, J. E. (1965) Aggressive Mimicry in Photuris: Firefly Femmes Fatales Science 149:653–654.</ref> Further research showed male fireflies from several different genus|genera are attracted to these "femmes fatales", and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species.

File:Marshall katydid QL.RIA small.jpg|left|thumb|The spotted predatory katydid (''Chlorobalius leucoviridis''), an acoustic aggressive mimic of cicadas
The listrosceline katydid ''Chlorobalius leucoviridis'' of inland Australia is capable of attracting male cicadas of the tribe Cicadettini by imitating the species-specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas.  This example of acoustic aggressive mimicry is similar to the ''Photuris'' firefly case in that the predator's mimicry is remarkably versatile – playback experiments show that ''C. leucoviridis'' is able to attract males of many cicada species, including cicadettine cicadas from other continents, even though cicada mating signals are species-specific.<ref>cite journal | last1=Marshall | first1=D.

Some carnivorous plants may also be able to increase their rate of capture through mimicry.<ref>cite journal | last1=Moran | first1=Jonathan A. | year=1996 | title=Pitcher dimorphism, prey composition and the mechanisms of prey attraction in the pitcher plant ''Nepenthes rafflesiana'' in Borneo | journal=Journal of Ecology | volume=84 | issue=4| pages=515–525 | doi=10.2307/2261474 | jstor=2261474 </ref>

Luring is not a necessary condition however, as the predator still has a significant advantage simply by not being identified as such. They may resemble a mutualistic symbiont or a species of little relevance to the prey.

File:Epinephelus tukula is cleaned by two Labroides dimidiatus.jpg|right|thumb|Two bluestreak cleaner wrasse cleaning a potato grouper, ''Epinephelus tukula''
A case of the latter situation is a species of cleaner fish and its mimic, though in this example the model is greatly disadvantaged by the presence of the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their body to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (''Labroides dimidiatus''), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (False cleanerfish|''Aspidontus taeniatus''). This wrasse resides in coral reefs in the Indian Ocean|Indian and the Pacific Ocean|Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes that then let it clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean—and not only looks like it in terms of size and animal coloration|coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's "dance". Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off a piece of its fin before fleeing. Fish grazing|grazed on in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, so both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.<ref>cite journal | author=Wickler, W. | year=1966 | title=Mimicry  in Tropical Fishes | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Another interesting example that does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles the turkey vulture. It flies amongst the vultures, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey.<ref>cite journal | author=Willis, E. O. | year=1963 | title=Is  the Zone-Tailed Hawk a Mimic of the Turkey Vulture? | journal=The Condor | volume=65 | issue=4| pages=313–317 | doi=10.2307/1365357 | jstor=1365357 </ref> Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively.

Parasites

Parasites can also be aggressive mimics, though the situation is somewhat different from those outlined previously. Some predators have a feature that draws prey; parasites can also mimic their hosts' natural prey, but are eaten themselves, a pathway into their host. ''Leucochloridium'', a genus of flatworm, matures in the digestive system of songbirds, their eggs then passing out of the bird in the faeces. They are then taken up by ''Succinea'', a terrestrial snail. The eggs develop in this intermediate host, and must then find a suitable bird to mature in. Since the host birds do not eat snails, the Trematode life cycle stages|sporocyst has another strategy to reach its host's intestine. They are brightly coloured and move in a pulsating fashion. A sporocyst-sac pulsates in the snail's eye stalks,<ref>[http://www.semioticon.com/seo/M/images/mimicry_2.jpg See here for a photo.]</ref><ref>cite book |author=Moore, J. |date=2002 |title=Parasites and the behavior of animals |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages= </ref> coming to resemble an irresistible meal for a songbird. In this way, it can bridge the gap between hosts, allowing it to complete its life cycle.<ref name=Wickler /> A nematode (''Myrmeconema neotropicum'') changes the colour of the abdomen of workers of the canopy ant ''Cephalotes atratus'' to make it appear like the ripe fruits of ''Hyeronima alchorneoides''. It also changes the behaviour of the ant so that the gaster (insect anatomy)|gaster (rear part) is held raised. This presumably increases the chances of the ant being eaten by birds. The droppings of birds are collected by other ants and fed to their brood, thereby helping to spread the nematode.<ref>cite journal | pmid=18279076 | year=2008 | last1=Yanoviak | first1=SP | last2=Kaspari | first2=M | last3=Dudley | first3=R | last4=Poinar Jr | first4=G | title=Parasite-induced fruit mimicry in a tropical canopy ant | volume=171 | issue=4 | pages=536–44 | doi=10.1086/528968 | journal=The American Naturalist |url=http://www.canopyants.com/2008_AmNat.pdf | format= PDF </ref>

In an unusual case, planidium larvae of some beetles of the genus ''Meloe'' form a group and produce a pheromone that mimics the sex attractant of its host Apidae|bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen. From there, they transfer to a female bee, and from there to the bee nest to parasitize the bee larvae.<ref>cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.0603901103 | title=Phoretic nest parasites use sexual deception to obtain transport to their host's nest | year=2006 | last1=Saul-Gershenz | first1=L.

File:Cuckoo Eggs Mimicking Reed Warbler Eggs.JPG|thumb|upright|Brood parasitism|Egg mimicry: cuckoo eggs (larger) mimic many species of host birds' eggs, in this case of Eurasian reed warbler|reed warbler.

Host-parasite mimicry is a two species system where a parasite mimics its own host. Cuckoos are a canonical example of brood parasitism, a form of parasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting individual, often from a different species, cutting down the biological mother's parental investment in the process. The ability to lay eggs that mimic the host eggs is the key adaptation. The adaptation to different hosts is inherited through the female line in so-called Gens (behaviour)|gentes (gens, singular). Cases of ''intraspecific'' brood parasitism, where a female lays in a conspecific's nest, as illustrated by the goldeneye (duck)|goldeneye duck (''Bucephala clangula''),<ref>cite journal | last1=Andersson | first1=M. | last2=Eriksson | first2=M.

A different mechanism is chemical mimicry, as seen in the parasitic butterfly ''Phengaris rebeli'', which parasitizes the ant species ''Myrmica schencki'' by releasing chemicals that fool the worker ants to believe that the caterpillar larvae are ant larvae, and enable the ''P. rebeli'' larvae to be brought directly into the ''M. schencki'' nest.<ref>cite journal |last=Barbero |first=Francesca |author2=Thomas JA |author3=Bonelli S |author4=Balletto E |author5=Schonrogge K |title=Acoustical mimicry in a predatory social parasite of ants |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |year=2009 |volume=212 |pages=4084–4090 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40039224 |accessdate=28 September 2013 |doi=10.1242/jeb.032912 |pmid=19946088 |issue=Pt 24</ref> Parasitic (cuckoo) bumblebees (formerly ''Psithyrus'', now included in ''Bombus'') resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance, at least in areas like Europe where parasite-host co-speciation is common.

Reproductive mimicry occurs when the actions of the dupe directly aid in the mimic's reproduction. This is common in plants with deceptive flowers that do not provide the reward they seem to offer and it may occur in Papua New Guinea fireflies, in which the signal of ''Pteroptyx effulgens'' is used by ''P. tarsalis'' to form aggregations to attract females.<ref name="Ohba & Shimoyama 2009">cite book|last1=Ohba|first1=N|last2=Shimoyama|first2=Ayu|title=Bioluminescence in Focus  -  a collection of illuminating essays|year=2009|editor=Meyer-Rochow V.B.|publisher=Research Signpost; Trivandrum, Kerala, India|pages=229–242</ref>  Other forms of mimicry have a reproductive component, such as Vavilovian mimicry involving seeds, vocal mimicry in birds<ref>Cite journal|last=Dalziell|first=Anastasia H.|last2=Welbergen|first2=Justin A.|last3=Igic|first3=Branislav|last4=Magrath|first4=Robert D.|date=2014-07-30|title=Avian vocal mimicry: a unified conceptual framework|journal=Biological Reviews|language=en|volume=90|issue=2|pages=643–668|doi=10.1111/brv.12129|pmid=25079896|issn=1464-7931</ref><ref>Cite journal|date=2008-09-01|title=Vocal mimicry in songbirds|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347208001796|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=76|issue=3|pages=521–528|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.04.012|issn=0003-3472|last1=Kelley|first1=Laura A.|last2=Coe|first2=Rebecca L.|last3=Madden|first3=Joah R.|last4=Healy|first4=Susan D.</ref><ref>Cite journal|last=Goller|first=Maria|last2=Shizuka|first2=Daizaburo|date=2018-06-22|title=Evolutionary origins of vocal mimicry in songbirds|journal=Evolution Letters|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=417–426|doi=10.1002/evl3.62|issn=2056-3744|pmc=6121844|pmid=30283692</ref>, and aggressive and Batesian mimicry in brood parasite-host systems.<ref>Cite book|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/cuckoo-9781408856567/|title=Cuckoo: Cheating by Nature|last=Davies|first=Nick|date=2015-03-12|publisher=Bloomsbury UK|isbn=9781408856567|location=|pages=|language=English</ref>

Bakerian mimicry, named after Herbert G. Baker,<ref>Baker H. G. 1976. "Mistake" pollination as a reproductive system, with special reference to the Caricaceae. Pp 161–169 in J. Burley and B. T. Styles, eds. Clarify|date=July 2013 ''Variation, breeding, and conservation of tropical trees''. Academic Press, London, U.K.</ref> is a form of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, cheating pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not be readily apparent as members of the same species may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae.<ref>cite journal | last1=Bawa | first1=K.

Like Bakerian mimicry, Dodsonian mimicry is a form of reproductive floral mimicry, but the model belongs to a different species than the mimic. The name refers to Calaway H. Dodson.<ref>cite journal | last1=Dodson | first1=C. H. | last2=Frymire | first2=G. P. | year=1961 | title=Natural pollination of orchids | journal=Missouri Botanical Garden Bulletin | volume=49 | issue=| pages=133–39 </ref> By providing similar sensory signals as the model flower, it can lure its pollinators. Like Bakerian mimics, no nectar is provided. ''Epidendrum ibaguense'' (Orchidaceae) resembles flowers of ''Lantana camara'' and ''Asclepias curassavica'', and is pollinated by monarch butterflies and perhaps hummingbirds.<ref>cite journal | last1=Boyden | first1=T.

The mimetic species may still have pollinators of its own though. For example, a Lamellicornia|lamellicorn beetle, which usually pollinates correspondingly colored ''Cistus'' flowers, is also known to aid in pollination of ''Ophrys'' species that are normally pollinated by bees.<ref>cite journal | last1=Kullenberg | first1=B. | year=1961 | title=Studies in ''Ophrys'' pollination | journal=Zool.

Pseudocopulation
further|Pseudocopulation
File:Ophrys insectifera Saarland 05.jpg|upright|thumb|The fly orchid (''Ophrys insectifera'')

Pseudocopulation occurs when a flower mimics a female of a certain insect species, inducing the males to try to copulate with the flower. This is much like the aggressive mimicry in fireflies described previously, but with a  more benign outcome for the pollinator. This form of mimicry has been called ''Pouyannian mimicry'',<ref name=Pasteur /> after Maurice-Alexandre Pouyanne, who first described the phenomenon.<ref>Correvon H., Pouyanne M. (1916) lang|fr|Un curieux cas de mimetisme chez les Ophrydées. ''J. Soc. Nat. Hortic.

H. (1966) ''Orchid Flowers; Their Pollination and Evolution''. Coral Gables, Florida, USA, Univ. Miami Press.</ref> Depending on the morphology of the flower, a pollen sac called a pollinia is attached to the head or abdomen of the male. This is then transferred to the Stigma (flower)|stigma of the next flower the male tries to inseminate, resulting in pollination. Visual mimicry is the most obvious sign of this deception for humans, but the visual aspect may be minor or non-existent. It is the senses of touch and olfaction that are most important.<ref name=Orchid />

Inter-sexual mimicry
main|Sexual mimicry
Inter-sexual mimicry occurs when individuals of one sex in a species mimic members of the opposite sex to facilitate Alternative mating strategy#Sneaking|sneak mating. An example is the three male forms of the marine isopod ''Paracerceis sculpta''. Alpha males are the largest and guard a harem of females. Beta males mimic females and manage to enter the harem of females without being detected by the alpha males allowing them to mate. Gamma males are the smallest males and mimic juveniles. This also allows them to mate with the females without the alpha males detecting them.<ref name="Shuster">cite journal |last=Shuster |first=Stephen |date=May 1987 |title=Alternative Reproductive Behaviors: Three Discrete Male Morphs in Paracerceis sculpta, an Intertidal Isopod from the Northern Gulf of California |journal=Journal of Crustacean Biology |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=318–327 |doi=10.2307/1548612 |jstor=1548612</ref> Similarly, among common side-blotched lizards, some males mimic the yellow throat coloration and even mating rejection behaviour of the other sex to sneak matings with guarded females.

main article|Automimicry

Automimicry or intraspecific mimicry occurs within a single species. One form of such mimicry is where one part of an organism's body resembles another part. For example, the tails of some snakes resemble their heads; they move backwards when threatened and present the predator with the tail, improving their chances of escape without fatal harm. Some fishes have eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots near their tails, and when mildly alarmed swim slowly backwards, presenting the tail as a head. Some insects such as some Lycaenidae|lycaenid butterflies have tail patterns and appendages of various degrees of sophistication that promote attacks at the rear rather than at the head. Several species of pygmy owl bear "false eyes" on the back of the head, misleading predators into reacting as though they were the subject of an aggressive stare.<ref>cite web|title=NORTHERN PYGMY OWL (Glaucidium californicum)|url=http://www.owlinstitute.org/northern-pygmy-owl.html|publisher=Owl Research Institute|accessdate=23 August 2015</ref>

Some writers use the term "automimicry" when the mimic imitates other morphs within the same species. For example, in a species where males mimic females or vice versa, this may be an instance of sexual mimicry in Evolutionary game theory#The side-blotched lizard|evolutionary game theory. Examples are found in some species of birds, fishes, and lizards.<ref>cite journal | last1=Plaistow | first1=Stewart J. | last2=Johnstone | first2=Rufus A. | last3=Colegrave | first3=Nick | last4=Spencer | first4=Matthew | year=2004 | title=Evolution of alternative mating tactics: conditional versus mixed strategies | journal=Behavioral Ecology | volume=15 | issue=4| pages=534–542 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arh029 </ref> Quite elaborate strategies along these lines are known, such as the well-known "scissors, paper, rock" mimicry in ''Common side-blotched lizard|Uta stansburiana'',<ref>Schell, Robert & Dettman, Jessica. Ecology and breeding colors of the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana) in the Grand Canyon.[https://watershed.ucdavis.edu/education/classes/files/content/flogs/lizard.pdf]</ref> but there are qualitatively different examples in many other species, such as some ''Platysaurus''.<ref>Lewis, Belinda Ann. Sexual Selection and Signalling in the Lizard Platysaurus minor. Thesis [http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/4740/Lewis_MSc.pdf]</ref>

Many species of insects are toxic or distasteful when they have fed on certain plants that contain chemicals of particular classes, but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Milkweed butterfly|Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects frequently are Aposematism|aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic members of the same species, this too may be seen as automimicry.<ref>cite journal | last1=Svennungsen | first1=Thomas Owens | last2=Holen | first2=Øistein Haugsten | year=2007 | title=The evolutionary stability of automimicry| journal=Proc.

Some species of caterpillar, such as many hawkmoths (Sphingidae), have Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots on their anterior abdominal segments. When alarmed, they retract the head and the thoracic segments into the body, leaving the apparently threatening large eyes at the front of the visible part of the body.<ref>cite journal |author=Martin Stevens |year=2005 |title=The role of eyespots as anti-predator mechanisms, principally demonstrated in the Lepidoptera |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=573–588 |doi=10.1017/S1464793105006810 |pmid=16221330</ref>

File:Gray Hairstreak (One more time...) (6222138633).jpg|thumb|upright|Automimicry: many blue butterflies (Lycaenidae) such as this gray hairstreak (''Strymon melinus'') have a false head at the rear, held upwards at rest.

Many insects have filamentous "tails" at the ends of their wings and patterns of markings on the wings themselves. These combine to create a "false head". This misdirects predators such as birds and jumping spiders (Salticidae). Spectacular examples occur in the Theclinae|hairstreak butterflies; when perching on a twig or flower, they commonly do so upside down and shift their rear wings repeatedly, causing antenna-like movements of the "tails" on their wings. Studies of rear-wing damage support the hypothesis that this strategy is effective in deflecting attacks from the insect's head.<ref>Andrei Sourakov (2013): Two heads are better than one: false head allows Calycopis cecrops (Lycaenidae) to escape predation by a Jumping Spider, Phidippus pulcherrimus (Salticidae), Journal of Natural History, 47:15-16, 1047-1054</ref><ref>Robbins, Robert K.

This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception but it is the leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a little in common with automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.<ref name=Batra/>

Evolution

It is widely accepted that mimicry evolution|evolves as a positive adaptation. The lepidopterist and novelist Vladimir Nabokov however argued that although natural selection might stabilize a "mimic" form, it would not be necessary to create it.<ref>cite journal | last1=Alexander | first1=Victoria N. | year=2002 | title=Nabokov, Teleology and Insect Mimicry | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nabokov_studies/summary/v007/7.alexander.html | journal=Nabokov Studies | volume=7 | issue=| pages=177–213 | doi=10.1353/nab.2010.0004 </ref>

The most widely accepted model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in modifier genes that regulate a complex cluster of linked genes that cause large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotype|phenotypic effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence that suggests that a few single point mutations cause large phenotypic effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a supergene for the development of butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics.<ref>cite journal | last1=Holmgren | first1=N. M.

Some mimicry is imperfect. Natural selection drives mimicry only far enough to deceive predators. For example, when predators avoid a mimic that imperfectly resembles a coral snake, the mimic is sufficiently protected.<ref name=Wilson>cite journal | author=Wilson, J., Jahner, J., Williams, K., & Forister, M. | date=2013 | title=Ecological and Evolutionary Processes Drive the Origin and Maintenance of Imperfect Mimicry | journal=PLOS ONE | volume=8 | issue=4 | page=1|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0061610 | pmid=23593490 | pmc=3625143 | bibcode=2013PLoSO...861610W </ref><ref>cite journal | author=Kikuchi, D., & Pfenning, D. | date=2010 | title=Predator Cognition Permits Imperfect Coral Snake Mimicry | journal=The American Naturalist | volume=176 | issue=6 | pages=830–834 | doi=10.1086/657041 | pmid=20950143</ref><ref>cite journal | author=Howse, P.
