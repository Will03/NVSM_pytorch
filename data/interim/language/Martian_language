Martian language (zh|c=火星文|p=huǒxīng wén|l=Martian script: 吙☆魰) is the nickname of unconventional representation of Chinese characters online. "Martian" describes that which seems strange to local culture.<ref> For example, when commenting on the possible blocking of Hotmail, one is quoted as "I can only conclude that the person in charge of this is considering it from a Martian point of view." [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,19133885-36375,00.html]</ref> The term was popularised by a line from the 2001 Hong Kong comedy ''Shaolin Soccer'', in which Sing (Stephen Chow) tells Mui (Zhao Wei): "Go back to Mars. The Earth is so dangerous."

In the 2006 General Scholastic Ability Test of Taiwan, students were asked to interpret symbols and phrases written in "Martian language",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091024125942/http://www.taiwan.com.au/Scitech/Internet/Trends/20060306.html Martian language banned in Taiwanese college entrance exam]</ref> and the controversies which followed forced the testing center to abandon the practice in future exams.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001617/http://english.www.gov.tw/TaiwanHeadlines/index.jsp?recordid=91979 Exam body agrees to omit 'Martian' from college exam]</ref>explain|date=May 2018

In 2007, Martian language began to catch on in mainland China. The first adopters of Martian language mainly consisted of Post-90s netizens. They use it in their nicknames, short messages, and chat rooms in order to demonstrate personality differences. Later, they found that their teachers and parents could hardly figure out their new language, which quickly became their secret code to communicate with each other.facts|date=June 2012

The Martian language became so popular in cyberspace that even some pieces of software were created to translate between Chinese and Martian language.fact|date=June 2012

Chinese online bloggers followed up the trend to use Martian language, because they found that their blog posts written in the new language can easily pass Internet censorship in China|Internet censorship engines, which are currently based on text-matching techniques.facts|date=June 2012

General aspects
unreferenced-section|date=May 2018
The Martian language is written from Chinese by means of various substitution methods. Just like in leet|l33t, where the letter ''"e"'' is replaced by the number ''"3"'', in Martian, standard Chinese characters are replaced with nonstandard ones, or foreign scripts. Each Chinese character may be replaced with:
# A character that is a homophone
# A character that looks similar
# A character with a similar radical (Chinese character)|radical
# A character with the same or similar meaning
# The Latin script, Cyrillic, hiragana, bopomofo, katakana, the International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA, other unicode symbols, SMS language, etc.
For example, the 星 in 火星文 ''huoxingwen'' (星 is literally "star"; 火星 is "Planet Mars") can be replaced by "☆", a Unicode symbol that visually represents an actual star. 的 is commonly replaced with の, as it has the same intended meaning in Japanese. 火 can become 吙 just by adding a 口 radical, which alters very little in terms of sound (but changes the meaning), and visually maintains the 火 image. In the same principle, 文 ''wen'' (''language'') can be replaced with 魰 by adding a 鱼 ''fish'' radical, which makes the character still look similar. Also, 的 is sometimes replaced with "d" due to its sound, as with 比 being replaced with "b"; Cyrillic can be used in a similar manner. 

Brain-disabled characters (zh|s=脑残体|t=腦殘體|p=nǎocán tǐ) are a subtype of Martian: BDC only includes Chinese characters and nothing else, while Martian language incorporates BDC, as well as scripts such as Cyrillic, Hiragana, Bopomofo, SMS, and others.

English translation
Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,

Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,

Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,

Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations...
