First names can also be called given names, and last names (surnames) can also be called family names. This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.

A given name (also known as a first name, forename or Christian name) is a part of a person's personal name.<ref name="grigg-1991">cite news|quote=In the last century and well into the present one, grown-up British people, with rare exceptions, addressed each other by their surnames. What we now call first names (then Christian names) were very little used outside the family. Men who became friends would drop the Mr and use their bare surnames as a mark of intimacy: e.g. Sherlock Holmes|Holmes and Dr. Watson|Watson. First names were only generally used for, and among, children. Today we have gone to the other extreme. People tend to be on first-name terms from the moment of introduction, and surnames are often hardly mentioned. Moreover, first names are relentlessly abbreviated, particularly in the media: Susan becomes Sue Lawley|Sue, Terrence Terry Wogan|Terry and Robert Bob Holness|Bob not only to friends and relations, but to millions who know these people only as faces and/or voices.|title=The Times|date=1991-11-02|first=John|last=Grigg|authorlink=John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham quoted in cite book|first=R.

The term ''given name'' refers to the fact that the name usually is bestowed upon a person, normally to a child by his or her parents at or close to the time of birth. A Christian name, a first name which historically was given at baptism, is now also typically given by the parents at birth.

In informal situations, given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner.<ref name="grigg-1991" /> In more formal situations, a person's surname is more commonly used—unless a distinction needs to be made between people with the same surname. The idioms "on a first-name basis" and "being on first-name terms" refer to the familiarity inherent in addressing someone by their given name.<ref name="grigg-1991" />

By contrast, a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or ''gentile'' name), which is normally inherited, is typically shared with other members of one's immediate family.<ref>"A name given to a person at birth or at baptism, as distinguished from a surname" – according to the [http://www.bartleby.com/61/61/G0136100.html American Heritage Dictionary] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173759/http://www.bartleby.com/61/61/G0136100.html|date=2008-12-11</ref> Regnal names and Religious name|religious or monastic names are special given names bestowed upon someone receiving a crown or entering a religious order. Such a person then typically becomes known chiefly by that name.

Name order
see also|Personal name#Name order
The order ''given name – family name'', commonly known as the ''Western order'', is used throughout most European countries and in countries that have cultures predominantly influenced by European culture, including North America|North and South America|South Americas|America; North India|North, East India|East, Geography of India|Central and Western India|West India; Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

The order ''family name – given name'', commonly known as the ''Eastern order'', is primarily used in East Asia (for example in China, Japan, Korea, Malaysian Chinese, Singapore, and Vietnam, among others), as well as in South India|Southern and Northeast India|North-Eastern parts of India, and in Hungary. This order is common also in Austria and Bavaria, and in France, Belgium, Greece and Italy, possibly because of the influence of bureaucracy, which commonly puts the family name before the given name. In China and Korea, generation name|part of the given name may be shared among all members of a given generation within a family and extended family or families, in order to differentiate those generations from other generations.

The order ''given name – father's family name – mother's family name'' is commonly used in Spanish-speaking countries to acknowledge the families of both parents. Today the order can also be changed legally in Spain and Uruguay using ''given name – mother's family name – father's family name''.

The order ''given name – mother's family name – father's family name'' is commonly used in Portuguese-speaking countries to acknowledge the families of both parents.

Multiple given names
In many Western world|Western cultures, people often have more than one given name. One of those which is not the first in succession might be used exclusively as the name which that person goes by, such as in the cases of John Edgar Hoover and Mary Barbara Hamilton Cartland.

Legal status
A child's given name or names are usually chosen by the parents soon after birth. If a name is not assigned at birth, one may be given at a naming ceremony, with family and friends in attendance. In most jurisdictions, a child's name at birth is a matter of public record, inscribed on a birth certificate, or its equivalent. In western cultures, people normally retain the same given name throughout their lives. However, in some cases these names may be changed by following legal processes or by repute. People may also change their names when immigrating from one country to another with different naming conventions.<ref>https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/Static_Files_Memoranda/Archives%201998-2008/2005/namingcnv091305.pdf</ref>

In certain jurisdictions, a government-appointed registrar of births may refuse to register a name that may cause a child harm, which is considered offensive or which are deemed impractical. In France, the agency can refer the case to a local judge. Some jurisdictions, such as Sweden, restrict the spelling of names.efn-lr|Protesting Swedish naming laws, in 1996, two parents attempted to name their child Naming law in Sweden#Protest names|Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116, stating that it was "a pregnant, expressionistic development that we see as an artistic creation".<ref>cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6525475.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Entertainment - Baby named Metallica rocks Sweden|publisher=|date=2007-04-04</ref>

Origins and meanings
<!-- These are examples and not exhaustive lists. Lists of first names exist at Wiktionary. Before adding any more examples please discuss on talk page.-->
Parents may choose a name because of its meaning. This may be a personal or familial meaning, such as giving a child the name of an admired person, or it may be an example of nominative determinism, in which the parents give the child a name that they believe will be lucky or favourable for the child. Given names most often derive from the following categories:
* Aspirational personal traits (external and internal). For example, the name Clement means "merciful".<ref>cite web

 </ref>

In many cultures, given names are reused, especially namesake|to commemorate ancestors or those who are particularly admired, resulting in a limited repertoire of names that sometimes vary by orthography.

The most familiar example of this, to Western readers, is the use of Biblical and saint|saints' names in most of the Christian countries (with Ethiopia, in which names were often ideals or abstractions—Haile Selassie, "power of the Trinity"; Haile Miriam, "power of Mary"—as the most conspicuous exception). However, the name Jesus (name)|Jesus is considered taboo or sacrilege|sacrilegious in some parts of the Christian world, though this taboo does not extend to the cognate Joshua or related forms which are common in many languages even among Christians.  In some Spanish speaking countries, the name Jesus is considered a normal given name.

Similarly, the name Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary, now popular among Christians, particularly Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics, was considered too holy for secular use until about the 12th century. In countries that particularly venerated Mary, this remained the case much longer; in Poland, until the arrival in the 17th century of French queens named Marie.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.poland.gov.pl/Polish,names,2470.html|title=Witamy|work=#Polska - oficjalny portal promocyjny</ref>

Most common given names in English (and many other European languages) can be grouped into broad categories based on their origin:

<!--

***
        These are examples and not exhaustive lists. Lists of first names exist at Wiktionary. Before adding any more examples please discuss on talk page.        ***

-->
* Hebrew names, most often from the Bible, are very common in—or are elements of names used in—the historically Christian countries. Theophoric name|Some have elements meaning "God", especially "Eli (disambiguation)|Eli". Examples: Michael, Joshua, Daniel, Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph, David, Adam (name)|Adam, Samuel, Elizabeth (given name)|Elizabeth, Hannah (given name)|Hannah and Mary (given name)|Mary. There are also a handful of names in use derived from the Aramaic language|Aramaic, particularly the names of prominent figures in the New Testament—such as Thomas the Apostle|Thomas, Martha and Bartholomew.
** All of the Semitic peoples of history and the present day use at least some names constructed like these in Hebrew (and the ancient Hebrews used names not constructed like these—such as Moses, probably an Egyptian name related to the names of Pharaohs like Thutmose and Ahmose). The Muslim world is the best-known example (with names like Saif-al-din, "sword of the faith", or Abd-Allah, "servant of God"), but even the Carthaginians had similar names: cf. Hannibal, "the grace of god" (in this case not the Abrahamic deity God, but the deity—probably Melkart—whose title is normally left untranslated, as Baal).
* Germanic names are characteristically warlike; roots with meanings like "glory", "strength", and "will" are common. The "-Bert (name)|bert" element common in many such names comes from ''beraht'', which means "wikt:bright|bright". Examples: Robert, Edward, Roger, Richard, Albert, Carl, Alfred, Rosalind, Emma, Emmett, Eric and Matilda (name)|Matilda.
* French forms of Germanic languages|Germanic names. Since the Norman conquest of England, many English given names of Germanic languages|Germanic origin are used in their French name|French forms. Examples: Robert, Charles, Henry (given name)|Henry, Albert.
<!--

***
        These are examples and not exhaustive lists. Lists of first names exist at Wiktionary. Before adding any more examples please discuss on talk page.        ***

-->
*Slavic names are often of a peaceful character, the compounds being derived from word root (linguistics)|roots meaning "to protect", "to love", "peace", "to praise [gods]", "to give". Examples: Milena (name)|Milena, Vesna (name)|Vesna, Bohumil, Dobromir (given name)|Dobromir, Svetlana, Vlastimil. The names have also warlike character and are built of words meaning "fighter", "war", "anger". Examples: Casimir, Vladimir (name)|Vladimir, Sambor (disambiguation)|Sambor, Wojciech and Zbigniew. Many of them derive from the root word "slava" - glory: Boleslaus|Boleslav, Miroslav (given name)|Miroslav, Vladislav, Radoslav (disambiguation)|Radoslav and Stanislav (given name)|Stanislav.
* Celtic languages|Celtic names are sometimes anglicisation|anglicised versions of Celtic language|Celtic forms, but the original form may also be used. Examples: Alan (name)|Alan, Brian, Brigid, Mórag, Ross, Logan (given name)|Logan, Ciarán, Jennifer (given name)|Jennifer, and John (name)#Evolution of the name John|Seán. These names often have origins in Celtic words, as Celtic versions of the names of internationally known Christianity|Christian saints, as names of Celtic mythology|Celtic mythological figures, or simply as long-standing names whose ultimate etymology is unclear.
* Greek names may be derived from the history and mythology of Classical Antiquity or be derived from the New Testament and early Christian traditions. Such names are often, but not always, anglicised. Examples: Helen (given name)|Helen, Stephen, Alexander, Andrew, Peter (name)|Peter, Gregory (given name)|Gregory, George (given name)|George, Christopher (name)|Christopher, Margaret (name)|Margaret, Nicholas, Jason (name)|Jason, Timothy (name)|Timothy, Chloe, Zoe (name)|Zoë, Katherine (given name)|Katherine, Penelope and Theodore (name)|Theodore.
*Roman naming conventions|Latin names can also be adopted unchanged, or modified; in particular, the inflected element can be dropped, as often happens in borrowings from Latin to English. Examples: Laura (name)|Laura, Victoria (name)|Victoria, Marcus (name)|Marcus, Justin (name)|Justin (Latin ''Justinus''), Paul (name)|Paul (Lat. ''Paulus''), Julius, Cecilia, Felix (name)|Felix, Vivian (personal name)|Vivian, Julia (given name)|Julia, Pascal (name)|Pascal (not a traditional-type Latin name, but the adjective-turned-name ''paschalis'', meaning 'of Easter' (''Pascha'')).
* Word names come from English vocabulary words. Feminine names of this sort—in more languages than English, and more cultures than Europe alone—frequently derive from nature, flowers, birds, colours, or gemstones. Examples include Jasmine, Lavender, Dawn, Asteraceae|Daisy, Rose, Iris (plant)|Iris, Petunia, Rowan, Jade, and Violet (plant)|Violet. Male names of this sort are less common—examples like Hunter (given name)|Hunter and Fischer, or names associated with strong animals, such as Bronco and Wolf. (This is more common in some other languages, such as Northern Germanic and Turkish).
* Trait names most conspicuously include the Christian virtues, mentioned above, and normally used as feminine names (such as the Theological virtues|three Christian virtues—Faith in Christianity|Faith, Hope (virtue)|Hope, and Charity (virtue)|Charity).
* Diminutives are sometimes used to distinguish between two or more people with the same given name. In English, Robert may be changed to "Robbie" or Thomas changed to "Tommy". In German the names John (name)#Evolution of the name John|Hänsel and Margaret (name)#Name Margaret in other languages|Gretel (as in the famous Hansel & Gretel|fairy tale) are the diminutive forms of Johann and Margarete. Examples: Victoria (name)|Vicky, Cindy (given name)|Cindy, Tommy, Abigail|Abby, Alison (name)|Allie.
* Shortened names (see nickname) are generally nicknames of a longer name, but they are instead given as a person's entire given name. For example, a man may simply be named "Jim", and it is not short for James (name)|James. Examples: Beth, Ben, Zach, Tom.
* Feminine variations exist for many masculine names, often in multiple forms. Examples: Charlotte (given name)|Charlotte, Stephanie, Victoria (name)|Victoria, Philippa, Jane (given name)|Jane, Jacqueline (name)|Jacqueline, Josephine (name)|Josephine, Danielle, Paula (given name)|Paula, Pauline (name)|Pauline, Patricia (disambiguation)|Patricia, Francesca.

Frequently, a given name has versions in many different languages. For example, the biblical name ''Susanna (disciple)|Susanna'' also occurs in its original biblical Hebrew language|biblical Hebrew version, ''Shoshannah'', its Spanish and Portuguese version ''Susana'', its French version, ''Suzanne'', and its Polish version, ''Zuzanna''.

See also|Chinese given names

Despite the uniformity of Chinese surnames, Chinese given names can be fairly original because Chinese characters can be combined extensively. Unlike European languages with their Biblical and Greco-Roman heritage, the Chinese language does not have a particular set of words reserved for given names: any combination of Chinese characters can theoretically be used as a given name. Nonetheless, a number of popular characters commonly recur, including "Strong" (linktext|伟, ''Wěi''), "Learned" (linktext|文, ''Wén''), "Peaceful" (linktext|安, ''Ān''), and "Beautiful" (linktext|美, ''Měi''). Despite China's increasing urbanization, a great many namesspaced ndashsuch as "Pine" (linktext|松, ''Sōng'') and "plum tree|Plum" (linktext|梅, ''Méi'')spaced ndashalso still reference nature.

Most Chinese given names are two characters long andspaced ndashdespite the examples abovespaced ndashthe two characters together may mean nothing at all. Instead, they may be selected to include particular sounds, Chinese tones|tones, or radical (Chinese characters)|radicals; to balance the five elements (China)|Chinese elements of a child's Chinese astrology|birth chart; or to honor a generation poem handed down through the family for centuries. Traditionally, it is considered an naming taboo|affront and not an honor to have a newborn named after an older relative, so that full names are rarely passed down through a family in the manner of American English ''Seniors,'' ''Juniors'', ''III'', etc. Similarly, it is considered disadvantageous for the child to bear a name already made famous by someone else, although romanization of Chinese|Romanizations might be identical or a common name like Liu Xiang (disambiguation)|Liu Xiang might be borne by tens of thousands.

Korean names and Vietnamese names are often simply conventions derived from Classical Chinese counterparts.Citation needed|date=March 2012

Many female Japanese names end in ''-ko'' (linktext|子), meaning "child". This can make them seem decidedly unfeminine to Europeans accustomed to Indo-European languages|Indo-European tendencies to end masculine names in ''o''.Citation needed|date=November 2016

In many Westernised Asian locations, many Asians also have an unofficial or even registered Western (typically English) given name, in addition to their Asian given name. This is also true for Asian students at colleges in countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia as well as among international businesspeople.

Gender
Most names in English are traditionally masculine or feminine, but there are unisex names as well, such as Jordan (name)|Jordan, Jamie, Jesse#Jesse as a given name|Jesse, Alex (disambiguation)|Alex, Ash (name)|Ash, Chris/Kris, Hilary/Hilary (name)|Hillary, Kim (given name)|Kim, Leslie/Lesley (disambiguation)|Lesley, Joseph (name)|Joe/Jo (disambiguation)|Jo, Jackie (given name)|Jackie, Pat (disambiguation)|Pat, Dana, or Sam (disambiguation)|Sam. Often, one gender is predominant.  Also, a particular spelling is often more common for either men or women, even if the pronunciation is the same. Predicting gender using names in the US or Europe is about 99% accurate.<ref>cite web|url=http://namesorts.com/2014/03/14/onomastics-api-for-gender-studies/|title=Onomastics API for Gender Studies|work=NamSor|date=2014-03-14</ref>

Many culture groups, past and present, did not or do not gender names strongly, so that many or all of their names are unisex. On the other hand, in many languages including most Indo-European languages (but not English), gender is inherent in the grammar. Some countries have laws preventing unisex names, requiring parents to give their children sex-specific names. Names may have different gender connotations from country to country or language to language.

Popularity distribution of given names
File:USA historical popular baby names.svg|thumb|250px|Most popular US baby names from 1880 to 2012
The popularity (frequency) distribution of given names typically follows a Zipf–Mandelbrot law|power law distribution.

Since about 1800 in England and Wales and in the U.S., the popularity distribution of given names has been shifting so that the most popular names are losing popularity. For example, in England and Wales, the most popular female and male names given to babies born in 1800 were Mary and John, with 24% of female babies and 22% of male babies receiving those names, respectively.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/names.htm|title=First Name Popularity in England and Wales over the Past Thousand Years|publisher=</ref> In contrast, the corresponding statistics for England and Wales in 1994 were Emily and James, with 3% and 4% of names, respectively. Not only have Mary and John gone out of favour in the English speaking world, the overall distribution of names has also changed significantly over the last 100&nbsp;years for females, but not for males. This has led to an increasing amount of diversity for female names.<ref>cite web|url=http://analyticalvisions.blogspot.com/2006/11/names.html|title=Analytical Visions|publisher=</ref>

=Choice of names=
Education, ethnicity, religion, class and political ideology affect parents' choice of names.  In the United States, popular names tend to be chosen by parents with more education.cn|date=April 2016 Politically conservative parents choose common and traditional names, while politically liberal parents choose the names of literary characters or other relatively obscure cultural figures.<ref>J. Eric Oliver, Thomas Wood, Alexandra Bass.  "Liberellas versus Konservatives: Social Status, Ideology, and Birth Names in the United States"  [http://conference.mpsanet.org/Online/Search.aspx?session=2834 Presented at] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713085234/http://conference.mpsanet.org/Online/Search.aspx?session=2834 |date=2013-07-13  the 2013 Midwestern Political Science Association Annual Meeting</ref>  Devout members of religions often choose names from their religious scriptures.  For example, Hindu parents may name a daughter Saanvi after the goddess, Jewish parents may name a boy Isaac after one of the earliest ancestral figures, and Muslim parents may name a boy Mohammed after the prophet.

There are many tools parents can use to choose names, including books, websites and applications. An example is the Baby Name Game that uses the Elo rating system to rank parents preferred names and help them select one.<ref name="Baby Name Game">[http://www.monkie.biz Baby Name Game].</ref>

=Influence of popular culture=
Refimprove section|date=October 2015
Popular culture appears to have an influence on naming trends, at least in the United States and United Kingdom. Newly famous celebrities and public figures may influence the popularity of names. For example, in 2004, the names "Keira" and "Kiera" (anglicisation of Irish name Ciara) respectively became the 51st and 92nd most popular girls' names in the UK, following the rise in popularity of British actress Keira Knightley.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=184|title=Office for National Statistics (ONS) - ONS|publisher=</ref> In 2001, the use of Colby as a boys' name for babies in the United States jumped from 233rd place to 99th, just after Colby Donaldson was the runner-up on ''Survivor: The Australian Outback''.citation needed|date=October 2015 Also, the female name "Miley" which before was not in the top 1000 was 278th most popular in 2007, following the rise to fame of singer-actress Miley Cyrus (who was named Destiny at birth).<ref name=ssa>[http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/ Popular Baby Names], Social Security Administration, USA</ref>

Characters from fiction also seem to influence naming. After the name Kayla was used for Kayla Brady|a character on the American soap opera ''Days of Our Lives'',<!--This is the correct rendering, per the show's title sequence.--> the name's popularity increased greatly. The name Tammy (given name)|Tammy, and the related Tamara (given name)|Tamara became popular after the movie ''Tammy and the Bachelor'' came out in 1957. Some names were established or spread by being used in literature. Notable examples include Pamela (name)|Pamela, invented by Sir Philip Sidney for a pivotal character in his epic prose work, ''The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia''; Jessica (given name)|Jessica, created by William Shakespeare in his play ''The Merchant of Venice''; Vanessa (name)|Vanessa, created by Jonathan Swift; Fiona, a character from James Macpherson's spurious cycle of Ossian poems; Wendy, an obscure name popularised by J. M. Barrie in his play ''Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up''; and Madison (name)|Madison, a character from the movie ''Splash (film)|Splash''. Lara (name)|Lara and Larissa (given name)|Larissa were rare in America before the appearance of ''Doctor Zhivago (1965 film)|Doctor Zhivago,'' and have become fairly common since.

Songs can influence the naming of children. Jude jumped from 814th most popular male name in 1968 to 668th in 1969, following the release of the Beatles' "Hey Jude". Similarly, Layla charted as 969th most popular in 1972 after the Eric Clapton song. It had not been in the top 1,000 before.<ref name=ssa/>

Kayleigh became a particularly popular name in the United Kingdom following the release of a song by the British rock group Marillion. Government statistics in 2005 revealed that 96% of Kayleighs were born after 1985, the year in which Marillion released "Kayleigh". citation needed|date=September 2013

Popular culture figures need not be admirable in order to influence naming trends. For example, Peyton came into the top 1000 as a female given name for babies in the United States for the first time in 1992 (at #583), immediately after it was featured as the name of an evil nanny in the film ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (film)|The Hand That Rocks the Cradle''.<ref name=ssa/> On the other hand, historical events can influence child-naming. For example, the given name Adolf has fallen out of use since the end of World War II in 1945.

In contrast with these anecdotal evidence, a comprehensive study of Norwegian first name datasets<ref>cite journal|title=You Name It – How Memory and Delay Govern First Name Dynamics|first1=David A.|last1=Kessler|first2=Yosi E.|last2=Maruvka|first3=Jøergen|last3=Ouren|first4=Nadav M.|last4=Shnerb|date=20 June 2012|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=6|pages=e38790|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0038790|pmid = 22745679|pmc=3380031</ref> shows that the main factors that govern first name dynamics are endogenous.  Monitoring the popularity of 1000 names along 130 years, the authors have identified only five cases of exogenous effects, three of them are connected to the names given to the babies of the Norwegian royal family.

Some possible changes concern middle names, diminutive forms, and changes relating to parental status (due to one's parents' divorce, or adoption by different parents). Matters are very different in some cultures in which a birth name is for childhood only, rather than for life.
