Etiquette in Latin America varies by country and by region within a given country.

Generalizations
File:Map-Latin America2.png|thumb|200px|right|Latin America is the area south of the Rio Grande, excluding Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname and other English speaking countries
There are several definitions of Latin America, but all of them define a huge expanse of geography with an incalculable amount of different customs. However, some generalizations can be made:

*Compared to much of the English language|English-speaking world, people from areas of Latin America may demonstrate more relaxed and casual behaviour and be more comfortable with loud talk, exaggerated gestures and physical contact. It is common to greet known people by kissing him/her in the cheek.<ref name="AR2006090701067.html">Erin Richards [http://www.budgettravelonline.com/bt-dyn/content/article/2006/09/07/AR2006090701067.html Cultural Etiquette] September 19, 2006</ref>
*In addition, many Latin American people have a smaller sense of personal space than people from English-speaking cultures. It may be rude to step away from someone when they are stepping closer.<ref name="AR2006090701067.html" />
*At some finer restaurants, it may be considered rude for the staff to bring a customer the check without the customer first requesting it.<ref name="2006_08.html">ACIS [http://www.acis.com/resources/traveltalk/2006_08.html Travel Talk August 2006]</ref>
*It is considered impolite to "toss" objects to people instead of directly handing it to them.<ref name="spanish-culture.htm">U.S. Institute of Languages [http://www.spanishprograms.com/spanish-culture.htm Spanish Culture and nonverbal communication]</ref>
*The American "come here" List of gestures|gesture of palm upwards with the fingers curled back can be considered a romantic solicitation.<ref name="spanish-culture.htm"/>

Specific regions
The following points of etiquette apply most specifically to a certain region:

=Brazil=

*Brazilians speak Portuguese (and usually do not refer to it as "Brazilian Portuguese", even though some expressions and spelling can be very different of European Portuguese; there is even a joke about other Brazilians over the people of Rio de Janeiro that they "do not really speak Portuguese", with many phonological differences given how their accent was influenced by Portugal's variant), not Spanish. Addressing someone who speaks Portuguese in Spanish, although most Brazilians understand Spanish to a reasonable degree, may be considered very offensive.<ref>cite book| last =Morrison| first =Terri| authorlink =|author2=Wayne A.

*In Brazil, a form of the American A-ok|"okay" gesture is obscene when directed at someone with the symbol upside down (back of hands down, circle forward to someone, rest of fingers to your self pointing any side), implying something like "go f... yourself!". However, the standard "okay" gesture is also used, as is the "thumbs signal|thumbs up" gesture.<ref name="airman/0406">https://web.archive.org/web/20090428024325/http://www.af.mil/news/airman/0406/top10.shtml</ref>
*The gesture of "flipping someone off" by hitting the wrist against the inside of the elbow (sometimes called "a banana" in Brazil) is considered playful and not very offensive (in some other parts of the world, this is more akin to "the finger").<ref name="airman/0406"/>
*Giving someone of the opposite gender a gift may be easily misinterpreted as a romantic overture, except for birthdays.<ref name="new006.html">Terri Morrison [http://www.getcustoms.com/2004GTC/Articles/new006.html The Business of Gifts]</ref>
*In some parts of the country, most notably in rural or suburban areas in which homes may not have doorbells, the appropriate action is to stand in the yard and clap one's hands. If no one comes to the door, then the visitor may approach the door, knock, and then step back away from the door and await a response. This is especially applicable in regards to small, thin-walled cottages that offer less privacy than homes in North America.<ref name="airman/0406"/>

=Haiti=
* Although tied more closely to France than to Spain or Portugal, the etiquette regarding Haiti is similar to other Latin American countries.<ref name="Haiti Medical Team">cite web|url=http://www.internationalmedicalrelief.org/info/Haiti%20Briefing%20Packet.pdf |title=Haiti Medical Team |accessdate=15 February 2014</ref>
* Haitians take proper behavior seriously and this includes good manners, clean appearances at all times, a moderate tone in one's speech and avoidance of any profanity or public "scenes", as these are all important indicators of one's social class.<ref>cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27PSnCeeedgC&pg=PA120 |title=Cultures of Color in America: A Guide to Family, Religion, and Health |author=Lassiter, Sybil M. |page=120 |year=1998 |isbn=0313300704 |accessdate=31 January 2015</ref>
* Entering a household and not greeting the elders or owners of the household is regarded as highly offensive.<ref name="Haiti Medical Team"/> Say ''bonjou'' (good morning) or ''bonswa'' (good afternoon) when entering a room or passing by someone on the street.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.bhm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Team-information.pdf |title=Baptist Haiti mission |accessdate=15 February 2014</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://cchaiti.org/cultural-dos-and-donts/ |title=Cultural Do's and Don’ts |accessdate=15 February 2014</ref>
* Eating is considered a social event and so withdrawing from the center of activities during meals is considered slightly offensive.<ref name="Haiti Medical Team"/><ref name="etiquettescholar.com">cite web|url=http://www.etiquettescholar.com/dining_etiquette/table-etiquette/carribbean_table_manners/haitian.html |title=International dining etiquette: Haiti |accessdate=15 February 2014</ref>
* At restaurants, the one who extended the invitation pays the bill. Unless another woman is present, a woman should not buy dinner for a man. Making arrangements for payment before the meal is considered especially polite. When summoning a server, make eye contact; waving or calling their names is very impolite.<ref name="etiquettescholar.com"/><ref name="Foster 2002 250">cite book|last= Foster |first= Dean|title=Global Etiquette Guide to Mexico and Latin America: Everything You Need to Know for Business and Travel Success|year= 2002 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=250|isbn=978-0471418511</ref>
* At the dining table, the European etiquette applies; ladies sit first, fork on the left, elbows off the table, etc.<ref name="etiquettescholar.com"/> When utensils are not being used, a person's hands are expected to be visible above the table resting the wrists on top of the table and not at one's lap. Diners are expected to stay at the table for the entire meal; no bathroom breaks.<ref name="etiquettescholar.com"/><ref name="Foster 2002 250" />
* While dining, for making a toast, the most common toast is ''sante'' (to your health). When beginning to eat wait until after the host says "''bon appetit''!" ("enjoy your meal!").<ref name="etiquettescholar.com"/>
* Relationships are important to Haitians, so business discussions should be saved until the end of the meal, or for later.<ref name="Foster 2002 250" />
* Avoid discussing politics, corruptions within the government, and Dominican Republic|Dominican life, without having a good understanding of the issues as well as the people with whom one is discussing it, and until one has established a relationship with the listener. These are touchy subjects to speak about, especially if one does not know what one is talking about.<ref name="Cultural Information - Haiti">cite web|url=http://www.intercultures.ca/cil-cai/ci-ic-eng.asp?iso=ht |title=Cultural Information - Haiti |accessdate=13 May 2014</ref>
* The infamous Haitian Creole phrase ''Langyèt Maman'w'' is highly offensive, insulting one's mother. Uttering this to someone will almost certainly provoke conflict.<ref name="Haiti Medical Team"/>
* It is rude to point at someone.<ref name="Cultural Information - Haiti" /><ref name="gwinnettcounty.com">cite web|url=https://www.gwinnettcounty.com/static/departments/communityservices/pdf/onestop_spring_2010.pdf |title=One Stop: Health and Human Services |accessdate=13 May 2014</ref>
* Haitians expect to barter when making a purchase.<ref name="Haiti Medical Team"/>
* Men shake hands on meeting and departing. Men and women kiss on the cheek when greeting. Women kiss each other on the cheek.  Friends, family and close acquaintances usually share a light kiss on the cheek.<ref name="Haiti Medical Team"/>
* When attending church (whether it be Catholic Church|Roman Catholic or Protestantism|Protestant), one's best formal shoes and clothes are to be worn.<ref>cite web|url=http://ourmissionispossible.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/06H-What-Do-I-Need-Haiti.pdf |title=Dress code, packing list, and travel information |accessdate=15 February 2014</ref>
* Punctuality in an informal setting is not highly valued and being late is usually not considered rude.<ref name="Cultural Information - Haiti" /><ref name="gwinnettcounty.com"/>
* People holding hands is an ordinary display of friendship though women and men, but seldom show public affection toward the opposite sex but are affectionate in private. It is also common for people of the same sexes to hold hands, and is often mistakenly viewed as homosexuality to outsiders.<ref name="Haiti Medical Team"/>
* Children are to be ''seen'' and ''not heard''; not to draw attention to one's self.

* Flatulence, when company is present, is very rude and should be done in another unoccupied place. It is polite to say "''excusez-moi''" (lang-ht|eskize'm), which means "excuse me".<ref name="Haiti Medical Team"/>
