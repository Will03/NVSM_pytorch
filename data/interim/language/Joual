''Joual'' (IPA-fr|ʒwal) is an accepted name for the linguistic features of basilectal Quebec French that are associated with the French-speaking working class in Montreal which has become a symbol of national identity for some.  ''joual'' is Social stigma|stigmatized by some and celebrated by others. While ''joual'' is often considered a sociolect of the Québécois working class, many feel that perception is outdated.  

Speakers of Quebec French from outside Montreal usually have other names to identify their speech, such as Magoua in Trois-Rivières, and Chaouin south of Trois-Rivières. Linguists tend to eschew this term, but historically some have reserved the term ''joual'' for the variant of Quebec French spoken in Montreal.<ref>Gilles Lefebvre, «Faut-il miser sur le joual?» ''Le Devoir'' 1965, 30 octobre; «L'étude de la culture: la linguistique.» ''Recherche sociographiques'' 3:1–2.233–249, 1962; Henri Wittmann, 1973. «Le joual, c'est-tu un créole?» La Linguistique 1973, 9:2.83–93.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1973a-joual.pdf]</ref>

Both the upward socio-economic mobility among the Québécois, and a cultural renaissance around ''joual'' connected to the Quiet Revolution in the Montreal East-End have resulted in ''joual'' being spoken by people across the educational and economic spectrum.  <!--At the beginning of the 20th century, ''joual'' was at best a kind of Creole language|Creole that also fitted the description of a Register (sociolinguistics)#Diatype|diatype more than any other categorization. (At best? what does that mean?)-->Today, many Québécois people|Québécois who were raised in Quebec during the 20th century (command of English notwithstanding) can understand and speak at least some ''joual''.

 Today 
Many feel that Joual is a part of a present culture in Quebec: evident in music, storytelling, television, radio, in movies and in conversations.

 Origin of the name ''joual'' 
Although coinage of the name ''joual'' is often attributed to French Canadian|French-Canadian journalist André Laurendeau, usage of this term throughout French-speaking Canada predates the 1930s.Citation needed|reason=no source|date=April 2013

The actual word ''joual'' is the representation of how the word ''cheval'' (Standard French: IPA-fr|ʃəval|, ''horse'') is pronounced by those who speak ''joual''. <!--''Cheval'' is usually pronounced as one syllable, IPA|[ʃval], by all francophones in the Francophonie.--> The weak schwa vowel IPA|[ə] disappeared. Then the Voiceless postalveolar fricative|voiceless IPA|[ʃ] was Voice (phonetics)|voiced to IPAblink|ʒ, thereby creating IPA|[ʒval]. Next, the IPA|[v] at the beginning of a syllable in some regional dialects of French or even in very rapid speech in general weakens to become the semi-vowel IPA|[w] written angbr|ou. The end result is the word IPA|[ʒwal] transcribed as ''joual''.Citation needed|reason=there is no evidence of this|date=April 2013

Most notable or stereotypical linguistic features

Diphthongs are normally present where long vowels would be present in standard French. There is also "sontaient, sonté" ("ils étaient, ils ont été").

Although ''moé''  and ''toé''  are today considered substandard slang pronunciations of ''toi'' and ''moi'', these were the pronunciations of ''ancien régime'' French used in all provinces of Northern France—by the royalty, aristocracy and common people.  After the 1789 French Revolution, the standard pronunciation in France changed to that of a previously-stigmatized form in the speech of Paris, but Quebec French continued to evolve from the historically older dialects, having become isolated from France following the 1760 Quebec#New France|British conquest of New France.<ref>Marc Picard, "La diphtongue /wa/ et ses équivalents en français du Canada." ''Cahiers de linguistique de l'Université du Québec'' 1974, 4.147–164.</ref>

''Joual'' shares many features with modern Oïl languages, such as Norman language|Norman, Gallo language|Gallo, Picard language|Picard, Poitevin (language)|Poitevin and Saintongeais though its affinities are greatest with the 17th century Koiné language|koiné of Paris.<ref>Henri Wittmann, "Le français de Paris dans le français des Amériques." ''Proceedings of the International Congress of Linguists'' 16.0416 (Paris, 20–25 juillet 1997). Oxford: Pergamon (CD edition). [http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1998a-fpparis.pdf]</ref> Speakers of these languages of France predominated among settlers to New France. Their usage varies.
 
It could easily be argued that at least some aspects of more modern ''joual'' are further linguistic contractions of standard French. D'la, for instance (de la), whereas the word de has nearly fallen out of usage over time and has become contracted. This argument does apply to other words and this concept permeates universally throughout the French language.

Another outstanding characteristic of ''Joual'' is the use of profanity called Quebec French profanity|sacre in everyday speech.<ref>Gilles Charest, ''Le livre des sacres et blasphèmes québécois.'' Montréal: L"Aurore, 1974; Jean-Pierre Pichette, ''Le guide raisonné des jurons.'' Montréal: Les Quinze, 1980; Diane Vincent, ''Pressions et impressions sur les sacres au Québec.'' Québec: Office de la langue française, 1982.</ref>

Some words were also previously thought to be of English origin, although modern research has shown them to be from regional French dialects:
* Pitoune (log, cute girl, loose girl): previously thought to come from "happy town" although the word "pitchoune" exists in dialects from southern France (possibly coming from the Occitan language|Occitan word "pichona", "little girl") and means "cute girl".
* Poutine: was thought to come from "pudding", but some have drawn a parallel with the Occitan language (also called Provençal or Languedoc) term "podinga", a stew made of scraps, which was (in Montreal) the previous use of the term.
