Rhyming slang is a form of slang word construction in the English language.  It is especially prevalent in the UK, Ireland and Australia. It started in the early 19th century in the East End of London; hence its alternative name, Cockney rhyming slang.<ref>cite web |title=A Word with You: Jack may have been a dull boy, but he had lots of friends |url=http://www.sharonherald.com/opinion/columns/a-word-with-you-jack-may-have-been-a-dull/article_b646b9a2-c282-5082-b2d8-15c191e14778.html |website=Sharon Herald |publisher=Sharon Herald |accessdate=10 October 2018</ref> In the United States, especially the criminal underworld of the West Coast of the United States|West Coast between 1880 and 1920, rhyming slang has sometimes been known as Australian slang.<ref>Eric Partridge, 2015, ''A Dictionary of the Underworld: British and American'' (1968 ed.); Abingdon, England/New York; Routledge; p. 12.</ref><ref>cite journal |author=Maurer, D.W. |title='Australian' Rhyming Argot in the American Underworld |journal=American Speech |volume=19 | issue = 3 |year=1944 |pages=183–195 |doi=10.2307/487290|jstor=487290 </ref><ref>cite book |author =Baker, Sidney J. |title=The Australian Language |year=1945 |chapter= Chapter XV | location =  | publisher =  | isbn =  | page=271full citation needed|date=January 2017</ref><ref>Cite journal|last=Partridge|first=Eric|date=1967|title=A dictionary of slang and unconventional English: colloquialisms and catch-phrases, solecisms and catachreses, nicknames, vulgarisms, and such Americanisms as have been naturalized|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001183457/Cite|journal=New York: Macmillan|volume=6 edition|pages=1894–1979|via=Carleton Library</ref>

The construction of rhyming slang involves replacing a common word with a phrase of two or more words, the last of which rhymes with the original word; then, in almost all cases, omitting, from the end of the phrase, the secondary rhyming word (which is thereafter implied),<!--, in a process called ''hemiteleia'',--><ref name="roberts">cite book|author=Roberts, Chris | year = 2006 |title=Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme | location = Waterville, ME |publisher=Gale/Thorndike Press|isbn=978-0-7862-8517-4full citation needed|date=January 2017</ref>page needed|date=January 2017<ref name=mother>cite book|author=Bryson, Bill| year = 1990 | title=Mother Tongue | location =  | publisher=Penguin Books | isbn=978-0-14-014305-8|quote=page needed|date=January 2017 Bryson, a humourist, states that there is a special name given to this omission: "the word that rhymes is almost always dropped... There's a technical term for this process as well: hemiteleia". Given that this is a genus of plant species, and appears in no readily available sources as a linguistic term, it is unclear whether the humourist was being humorous, or informative.</ref> making the origin and meaning of the phrase elusive to listeners not in the know.<ref name="ayto">cite book|author=Ayto, John|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Rhyming Slang|location = Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-19-280122-7full citation needed|date=January 2017</ref>page needed|date=January 2017

 Examples 
The form that is followed is made clear with the following example. The rhyming phrase "apples and pears" evolved to mean "stairs". Following the pattern of omission, "and pears" is dropped, thus the spoken phrase "I'm going up the apples" means "I'm going up the stairs".<ref name="cockney-guide">cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/09/guide-to-cockney-rhyming-slang|title=Guide to Cockney Rhyming Slang|date=9 June 2014|access-date=25 March 2018|website=The Guardian|last=Jacot de Boinod|first=Adam|author-link=Adam Jacot de Boinod</ref>

The following are further common examples of these phrases:<ref name="cockney-guide" />
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Slang Word !! Meaning !! Original Phrase
|-
| dog || telephone || dog-and-bone
|-
| trouble || wife || trouble-and-strife
|-
| mincers || eyes || mince-pies
|-
| syrup || wig || syrup-of-figs
|-
| plates || feet || plates-of-meat
|-
| frog || road || frog-and-toad
|-
| apples || stairs || apples-and-pears
|-
| Khyber || arse ||  Khyber Pass
|-
| Septic|| Yank ||  septic tank
|-
| Turkish || laugh || Turkish bath (pronounced "bahf" IPA|/baf/)
|}
Thus a construction of the following type could conceivably arise: "It nearly knocked me off me plates – the septic was wearing a syrup! I couldn't believe me mincers, so I ran up the apples, got straight on the dog to me trouble and we had a Turkish."

In some examples the meaning is further obscured by adding a second iteration of rhyme and truncation to the original rhymed phrase. For example, the word "Aris" is often used to indicate the buttocks. This is the result of a double rhyme, starting with the original rough synonym "arse", which is rhymed with "bottle and glass", leading to "bottle". "Bottle" was then rhymed with "Aristotle" and truncated to "Aris".<ref>Cite book|title=Cockney rabbit : a Dick'n'Arry of rhyming slang|last=Puxley|first=Ray|date=1992|publisher=Robson Books|isbn=978-0-86051-827-3|location=London|pages=4–5|oclc=28477779</ref><!--<ref name=mother />DEMANDS VERIFICATION FROM EXPERT OR SECOND SOURCE, SEE EDIT SUMMARY-->

It remains a matter of speculation whether rhyming slang was a linguistic accident, a game, or a cryptolect developed intentionally to confuse non-locals.according to whom|date=January 2017 If deliberate, it may also have been used to maintain a sense of community, or to allow traders to talk amongst themselves in marketplaces in order to facilitate collusion, without customers knowing what they were saying, or by criminals to confuse the police (see thieves' cant).citation needed|date=January 2017

Many examples of rhyming slang are based on locations in London, such as "Peckham Rye", meaning "tie" (as in necktie), which dates from the late 19th century; "Hampstead Heath", meaning "teeth" (usually as "Hampsteads"), which was first recorded in 1887; and "Barnet Fair", meaning "hair", which dates from the 1850s.

By the mid-20th century many rhyming slang expressions used the names of contemporary personalities, especially actors and performers: for example "Gregory Peck"  meaning "neck" and also "cheque"; "Ruby Murray" meaning "curry"; "Alans", meaning "knickers" from Alan Whicker; "Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller" meaning "pillow" when pronounced /ˈpilə/  and "Henry Hall (bandleader)|Henry Halls" for "balls (testicles)".

The use of personal names as rhymes continued into the late 20th century, for example "Tony Blairs" meaning "flares", as in trousers with a wide bottom (previously this was "Lionel Blairs"  and this change illustrates the ongoing mutation of the forms of expression) and  "Britney Spears", meaning "beers".

Many examples have passed into common usage. Some substitutions have become relatively widespread in England in their contracted form. "To have a butcher's", meaning to have a look, originates from "butcher's hook", an S-shaped hook used by butchers to hang up meat, and dates from the late 19th century but has existed independently in general use from around the 1930s simply as "butchers". Similarly, "use your loaf", meaning "use your head", derives from "loaf of bread" and also dates from the late 19th century but came into independent use in the 1930s.<ref name="ayto" />page needed|date=January 2017 To "have a giraffe" is commonly employed for a "laugh"<!--, although technically this does not involve hemiteleia-->.

In some cases, false etymologies exist. For example, the term "barney" has been used to mean an altercation or fight since the late 19th century, although without a clear derivation.<ref name = Partridge91>cite book | author = Partridge, Eric | year = 1991 | title = A Concise Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English | location = London | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 978-0-415-06352-4 | url =  | access-date =  full citation needed|date=January 2017</ref>rp|p. 22 In the 2001 feature film ''Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven'', the explanation for the term is that it derives from Barney Rubble,citation needed|date=January 2017 the name of a cartoon character from the ''The Flintstones|Flintstones'' television  program many decades later in origin, and so an obviously incorrect explanation.citation needed|date=January 2017<!--Early bulletin board posting moved to external links as a non-authoritative source that DOES NOT IN ANY CASE SUPPORT THIS SENTENCE.--><ref>For an authoritative definition and etymology, see "Barney," op. cit., at cite book | author = Partridge, Eric | editor = Beale, Paul | year = 2002 | title = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English | location = London | publisher = Routledge | edition = 8th Edn. | isbn = 978-0-415-29189-7 | url =  | access-date =  </ref>

= Regional and international variations =
Rhyming slang is used mainly in London in England but can to some degree be understood across the country. Some constructions, however, rely on particular regional accents for the rhymes to work. For instance, the term "Charing Cross" (a place in London), used to mean "horse" since the mid-19th century,<ref name="ayto" />page needed|date=January 2017 does not work for a speaker without the lot–cloth split, common in London at that time but not nowadays. A similar example is "Joanna" meaning "piano", which is based on the pronunciation of "piano" as "pianna" IPAc-en|p|i|ˈ|æ|n|ə.citation needed|date=January 2017 Unique formations also exist in other parts of the United Kingdom, such as in the East Midlands, where the local accent has formed "Derby Road", which rhymes with "cold".citation needed|date=January 2017

Outside England, rhyming slang is used in many English-speaking countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, with local variations. For example, in Australian slang, the term for an English person is "Alternative words for British#Pommy|pommy", which has been proposed as a rhyme on "pomegranate" rhyming with "immigrant".<ref>The ''Oxford English Dictionary''clarify|date=January 2017 cites a well-known Australian weekly, ''The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin'', which on 14 November 1912 reported: "The other day a Pummy Grant (assisted immigrant) was handed a bridle and told to catch a horse."

Rhyming slang is continually evolving, and new phrases are introduced all the time; new personalities replace old ones—pop culture introduces new words—as in "I haven't a Scooby" (from Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby Doo, the eponymous cartoon dog of the Scooby-Doo|cartoon series) meaning "I haven't a clue".<ref>cite dictionary|entry=Scooby"|work=Oxford Dictionaries|via=OxfordDictionaries.com|date=22 March 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/scooby|access-date=22 March 2017|quote=1990s; earliest use found in The Glasgow Herald. Short for ScoobyDoo, the name of a cartoon dog which features in several U.S. television series and films (which typically include the name of the dog in the title), as rhyming slang for clue.</ref>

= Taboo terms =
Rhyming slang is often used as a substitute for words regarded as taboo, often to the extent that the association with the taboo word becomes unknown over time. "wikt:berk|Berk" (often used to mean "foolish person") originates from the most famous of all fox hunting|fox hunts, the  "Berkeley Hunt" meaning "cunt"; "wikt:cobblers|cobblers" (often used in the context "what you said is rubbish") originates from "Stitching awl|cobbler's awls", meaning "balls" (as in testicles); and "hampton" meaning "prick" (as in penis) originates from "Hampton Wick" (a place in London).

Lesser taboo terms include "pony and Trap (carriage)#Types of horse-drawn carriages|trap" for "crap" (as in defecate, but often used to denote nonsense or low quality); to blow a Blowing a raspberry|raspberry (rude sound of derision) from raspberry tart for "fart"; "D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte (an opera company) for "fart"; "Jimmy Riddle" (an American country musician) for "piddle" (as in urinate), "J. Arthur Rank" (a film mogul), "Jodrell Bank" or "Ham hock|ham shank" for "wank (sexual act)|wank", "Bristol City Football Club|Bristol Cities" (contracted to 'Bristols') for "titties", etc. "Taking the Mick" or "taking the Mickey" is thought to be a rhyming slang form of "taking the piss", where "Mick" came from "Mickey Bliss".<ref>cite AV media |people= BBC Staff; Styles, Tania & Gilliver, Peter [OED] |date= January 9, 2009 |title= ''Balderdash and Piffle'': Who Were They?—Tricky Verdicts |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/wordhunt/whoweretheyextras.shtml |access-date= |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090109062814/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/wordhunt/whoweretheyextras.shtml |archive-date= January 9, 2009 |time= |location= |publisher= BBC |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= </ref>

Rhyming slang terms for Jew have included "Chelsea Football Club|Chelsea Blue", "Glue|Stick of Glue", "dimensional lumber|Four by Two", "Shoemaking|Buckle my shoe", and "Front Wheel Skid", which is a more arcane form of the insulting term "Yid" (which itself comes from the Yiddish word for a Jew).

In December 2004 Joe Pasquale, winner of the fourth series of ITV (TV network)|ITV's ''I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!'', became well known for his frequent use of the term "Jacobs", for Jacob's Crackers, a rhyming slang term for knackers i.e. testicles.

 In popular culture 
= In film =

Cary Grant's character teaches rhyming slang to his female companion in ''Mr. Lucky (film)|Mr. Lucky'' (1943), describing it as 'Australian rhyming slang'. Rhyming slang is also used and described in a scene of the 1967 film ''To Sir, with Love'' starring Sidney Poitier, where the English students tell their foreign teacher that the slang is a drag and something for old people.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/t/to-sir-with-love-script.html|title=To Sir With Love – Script – transcript from the screenplay and/or Sidney Poitier movie|author=|date=|website=www.script-o-rama.com|accessdate=19 March 2018</ref> The closing song of the 1969 crime caper, ''The Italian Job'', ("Getta Bloomin' Move On" a.k.a. "The Self Preservation Society") contains many slang terms.

Rhyming slang has been used to lend authenticity to an East End setting. Examples include ''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' (1998) (wherein the slang is translated via subtitles in one scene); ''The Limey'' (1999); ''Sexy Beast'' (2000); ''Snatch (film)|Snatch'' (2000); ''Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven'' (2001); and ''Austin Powers in Goldmember'' (2002); ''It's All Gone Pete Tong'' (2004), after BBC radio disc jockey Pete Tong whose name is used in this context as rhyming slang for "wrong"; ''Green Street Hooligans'' (2005). In Margin Call (film)|''Margin Call'' (2011), Will Emerson, played by London-born actor Paul Bettany, asks a friend on the telephone, "How's the trouble and strife?" ("wife").

Cockneys vs Zombies (2012) mocked the genesis of rhyming slang terms when a Cockney character calls zombies "Trafalgars" to even his Cockney fellows' puzzlement; he then explains it thus: "''Trafalgar square – fox and hare – hairy cheek – five day week – weak and feeble – pins and needles – needle and stitch – Abercrombie and Fitch – Abercrombie: zombie''".

The live-action Disney film Mary Poppins Returns song "Trip A Little Light Fantastic" involves Cockney rhyming slang in part of its lyrics, and is primarily spoken by the London lamplighters.

= Television =
One early US show to regularly feature rhyming slang was the Saturday morning children's show ''The Bugaloos'' (1970–72), with the character of Harmony (Wayne Laryea) often incorporating it in his dialogue.

In Britain, rhyming slang had a resurgence of popular interest beginning in the 1970s, resulting from its use in a number of London-based television programmes such as ''Steptoe and Son'' (1970–74); and ''Not On Your Nellie'' (1974–75), starring Hylda Baker as Nellie Pickersgill, alludes to the phrase "not on your Nellie Duff", rhyming slang for "not on your puff" i.e. not on your life. Similarly, ''The Sweeney'' (1975–78) alludes to the phrase "Sweeney Todd" for "Flying Squad", a rapid response unit of London’s Metropolitan Police. In ''The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin'' (1976–79), a comic twist was added to rhyming slang by way of spurious and fabricated examples which a young man had laboriously attempted to explain to his father (e.g. 'dustbins' meaning 'children', as in 'dustbin lids'='kids'; 'Teds' being 'Ted Heath' and thus 'teeth'; and even 'Chitty Chitty' being 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', and thus 'rhyming slang'...). It was also featured in an episode of ''The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life'' in the first season (1975) where Tom and Barbara purchase a wood burning range from a junk trader called Sam, who litters his language with phony slang in hopes of getting higher payment. He comes up with a fake story as to the origin of Cockney Rhyming slang and is caught out rather quickly. In ''The Jeffersons'' season 2 (1976) episode "The Breakup: Part 2", Harry Bentley (character)|Mr. Bentley explains Cockney rhyming slang to George Jefferson, in that "whistle and flute" means "suit", "apples and pears" means "stairs", "plates of meat" means "feet".

The use of rhyming slang was also prominent in ''Mind Your Language'' (1977–79), ''Citizen Smith'' (1977–80), ''Minder (TV series)|Minder''<ref>cite book |author=Hawkins, Brian |year=2002 |title=The Phenomenon That Was Minder |page= |location= |publisher=Chameleon Press |isbn=978-9628681211 |url= |access-date= full citation needed|date=January 2017</ref>page needed|date=January 2017 (1979–94), ''Only Fools and Horses'' (1981–91), and ''EastEnders'' (1985-). ''Minder'' could be quite uncompromising in its use of obscure forms without any clarification. Thus the non-Cockney viewer was obliged to deduce that, say, "iron" was "male homosexual" ('iron'='iron hoof'='poof'). One episode in Series 5 of ''Steptoe and Son'' was entitled "Any Old Iron", for the same reason, when Albert thinks that Harold is 'on the turn'.

= Music =
In popular music, Spike Jones and his City Slickers recorded "So 'Elp Me", based on rhyming slang<!-- (without the hemiteleia)-->, in 1950.  The 1967 Kinks song "Harry Rag" was based on the usage of the name Harry Wragg as rhyming slang for "fag" (i.e. a cigarette). The idiom made a brief appearance in the UK-based DJ reggae music of the 1980s in the hit "Cockney Translation" by Smiley Culture of South London; this was followed a couple of years later by Domenick and Peter Metro's "Cockney and Yardie". London-based artists such as Audio Bullys and Chas & Dave (and others from elsewhere in the UK, such as The Streets, who are from Birmingham) frequently use rhyming slang in their songs.

In modern literature, Cockney rhyming slang is used frequently in the novels and short stories of Kim Newman, for instance in the short story collections "The Man from the Diogenes Club" (2006) and "Secret Files of the Diogenes Club" (2007), where it is explained at the end of each book.<ref>cite web | author = Newman, Kim  | date = June 18, 2014 | title = ''Cult'': A Shambles in Belgravia | website = BBC.com | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/sherlock/shamblesinbelgravia1.shtml | access-date = January 26, 2017 </ref> In the novel ''Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures'' by Terry Pratchett, this slang is also frequently used.citation needed|date=January 2017

It is also parodied in Pratchett's ''Going Postal'', which features a geriatric Junior Postman by the name of Tolliver Groat, a speaker of 'Dimwell Arrhythmic Rhyming Slang', or rather, rhyming slang which ''does not actually rhyme''. Thus, a wig is a 'prunes', from 'syrup of prunes', an obvious parody of the Cockney ''syrup'' from ''syrup of figs -- wig''.  There are numerous other parodies, though it has been pointed out that the result is even more impenetrable than a conventional rhyming slang and so may not be quite so illogical as it seems, given the assumed purpose of rhyming slang as a means of communicating in a manner unintelligible to all but the initiated.

In Scottish football, a number of clubs have nicknames taken from rhyming slang. Partick Thistle are known as the "Harry Rags", which is taken from the rhyming slang of their 'official' nickname "the jags". Rangers are known as the "Teddy Bears", which comes from the rhyming slang for "the Gers" (shortened version of Ran-gers).  Heart of Midlothian are known as the "Jambos", which comes from "Jam Tarts" which is the rhyming slang for "Hearts" which is the common abbreviation of the Club's name. Hibernian are also referred to as "The Cabbage" which comes from Cabbage and Ribs being the rhyming slang for Hibs.
