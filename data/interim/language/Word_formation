In linguistics, word formation is the creation of a new word. Word formation is sometimes contrasted with semantic change, which is a change in a single word's meaning. The boundary between word formation and semantic change can be difficult to define: a new use of an old word can be seen as a new word derived from an old one and identical to it in form. See 'conversion (word formation)|conversion'. 

Types
There are a number of methods of word formation.

=Blending=
main|Blend word
A blend is a word formed by joining parts of two words after clipping.  An example is ''smog'', which comes from ''smoke'' and ''fog'', or ''brunch'', which comes from 'breakfast' and 'lunch'.

One subcategory of blending is the reduction of a word to one of its parts, e.g., fax (facsimile), flu (influenza) and bot (robot). Such clipped words may not retain their original meaning. For example, "playing a video game against a video game bot|bot" is not the same as "playing a video game against a robot".

=Calque=
main|Calque

A calque is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal, word-for-word or root-for-root translation. For example, the English phrase ''to lose face'' is a calque from the Chinese "丟臉/丢脸".

A subcategory of calques is the semantic loan, that is, the extension of the meaning of a word to include new, foreign meanings.

=Neologism=
main|Neologism
A neologism is a process of forming a new word by coining such as Quark#Etymology|''quark''.

Subcategories of neologisms include:
* The eponym, a proper noun that becomes commonly used for an idea it is associated with, usually by changing its part of speech, like Xerox, Orwellian, and Stentorian
* The loanword, a word borrowed from another language, as ''cliché'' is from French
* An Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic word, a word which imitates natural sounds, like the bird name ''cuckoo''
* Formation using phono-semantic matching, that is, matching a foreign word with a phonetically and semantically similar, pre-existing native word or root
