Transliteration is a type of conversion of a text from one script to another<ref>Kharusi, N. S. & Salman, A. (2011) The English Transliteration of Place Names in Oman. Journal of Academic and Applied Studies Vol. 1(3) September 2011, pp. 1–27 Available online at www.academians.org</ref> that involves swapping letter (alphabet)|letters (thus ''wikt:trans-#Prefix|trans-'' + ''wikt:littera#Latin|liter-'') in predictable ways (such as alpha|α → a, de (Cyrillic)|д → d, chi (letter)|χ → ch (digraph)|ch, ն → n or æ → e).

For instance, for the Greek language|Modern Greek term "lang|el|Ελληνική Δημοκρατία", which is usually translation|translated as "Hellenic Republic", the usual transliteration to Latin script is "transl|el|Ellēnikḗ Dēmokratía", and the name for Russia in Cyrillic script, "lang|ru|Россия", is scientific transliteration of Cyrillic|usually transliterated as "Rossiya".

Transliteration is not primarily concerned with representing the phonetics|sounds of the original but rather with representing the characters, ideally accurately and unambiguously. Thus, in the above example, λλ is transliterated as 'll', but pronounced /l/; Δ is transliterated as 'D', but pronounced /ð/; and η is transliterated as 'ē', though it is pronounced /i/ (exactly like ι) and is not vowel length|long.

Conversely, transcription (linguistics)|transcription notes the ''sounds'' but not necessarily the spelling. So "lang|el|Ελληνική Δημοκρατία" could be transcribed as "transl|el|elinikí ðimokratía", which does not specify which of the /i/ sounds are written as η and which as ι.

Definitions
Systematic transliteration is a Map (mathematics)|mapping from one system of writing into another, typically grapheme to grapheme. Most transliteration systems are one-to-one correspondence|one-to-one, so a reader who <span lang="my" dir="ltr">knows</span> the system can reconstruct the original spelling.

Transliteration is opposed to transcription (linguistics)|transcription, which maps the ''Phone (phonetics)|sounds'' of one language into a writing system. Still, most systems of transliteration map the letters of the source script to letters pronounced similarly in the target script, for some specific pair of source and target language. If the relations between letters and sounds are similar in both languages, a transliteration may be very close to a transcription. In practice, there are some mixed transliteration/transcription systems that transliterate a part of the original script and transcribe the rest?

For many script pairs, there is one or more standard transliteration systems. However, unsystematic transliteration is common.

Difference from transcription
In Modern Greek language|Greek, the letters &lt;η&gt; &lt;ι&gt; &lt;υ&gt; and the letter combinations &lt;ει&gt; &lt;oι&gt; &lt;υι&gt; are pronounced IPA|[i] (except when pronounced as semivowels), and a modern transcription renders them all as &lt;i&gt;; but a transliteration distinguishes them, for example by transliterating to &lt;ē&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;y&gt; and &lt;ei&gt; &lt;oi&gt; &lt;yi&gt;. (As the ancient pronunciation of &lt;η&gt; was IPA|[ɛː], it is often transliterated as an &lt;e&gt; with a Macron (diacritic)|macron, even for modern texts.) On the other hand, &lt;ευ&gt; is sometimes pronounced IPA|[ev] and sometimes IPA|[ef], depending on the following sound. A transcription distinguishes them, but this is no requirement for a transliteration. The initial letter 'h' reflecting the historical rough breathing in words such as Ellēnikē should logically be omitted in transcription from Koine Greek on,<ref>See Koine Greek phonology.</ref> and from transliteration from Greek diacritics|1982 on, but it is nonetheless frequently encountered.

Challenges
A simple example of difficulties in transliteration is the Arabic letter qāf. It is pronounced, in literary Arabic, approximately like English [k], except that the tongue makes contact not on the soft palate but on the uvula, but the pronunciation varies between different dialects of Arabic. The letter is sometimes transliterated into "g", sometimes into "q" and rarely even into "k" in English.<ref>[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2989 Language log]</ref> Another example is the Russian letter Kha (Cyrillic)|"Х" (kha). It is pronounced as the voiceless velar fricative IPA|/x/, like the Scottish pronunciation of angbr|ch in "loch". This sound is not present in most forms of English, and is often transliterated as "kh", as in Nikita Khrushchev. Many languages have phonemic sounds, such as click consonants, which are quite unlike any phoneme in the language into which they are being transliterated.

Some languages and Writing system|scripts present particular difficulties to transcribers. These are discussed on separate pages.
