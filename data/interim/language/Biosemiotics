Semiotics
Biosemiotics (from the Ancient Greek|Greek βίος ''bios'', "life" and σημειωτικός ''sēmeiōtikos'', "observant of signs") is a field of semiotics and biology that studies the prelinguistic meaning-making, or production and interpretation (logic)|interpretation of Sign (semiotics)|signs and Code (semiotics)|codes<ref>Marcello Barbieri, 2008. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00114-008-0368-x#/ ''Biosemiotics: a new understanding of life''], ''Naturwissenschaften'', Vol. 95, Iss. 7, pp. 577–599</ref> in the biological realm. Biosemiotics attempts to integrate the findings of biology and semiotics and proposes a paradigm shift|paradigmatic shift in the scientific view of life, demonstrating that  semiosis (sign process, including Meaning (semiotics)|meaning and interpretation) is one of its immanent and intrinsic features. The term ''biosemiotic'' was first used by Friedrich S. Rothschild in 1962, but Thomas Sebeok and Thure von Uexküll have implemented the term and field.<ref>Kull, Kalevi 1999. Biosemiotics in the twentieth century: A view from biology. ''Semiotica'' 127(1/4): 385–414.</ref> The field, which challenges normative views of biology, is generally divided between theoretical and applied biosemiotics.

Definition
Biosemiotics is ''biology interpreted as a sign systems study'', or, to elaborate, a study of 
* Sign (semiotics)|signification, communication and habituation|habit formation of life|living processes 
* semiosis (changing sign relations) in living nature
* the biological basis of all signs and sign interpretation

Main branches
According to the basic types of semiosis under study, biosemiotics can be divided into 
*vegetative semiotics (also endosemiotics, or phytosemiotics), the study of semiosis at the cellular and molecular level (including the translation processes related to genome and the organic form or phenotype);<ref>Kull, Kalevi 2000. [https://www.academia.edu/3520416/An_introduction_to_phytosemiotics_Semiotic_botany_and_vegetative_sign_systems An introduction to phytosemiotics: Semiotic botany and vegetative sign systems.] ''Sign Systems Studies'' 28: 326–350.</ref><ref>Witzany, Guenther 2008. The biosemiotics of plant communication. ''American Journal for Semiotic Studies'' 24: 39–56.</ref> vegetative semiosis occurs in all organisms at their cellular and tissue level; vegetative semiotics includes prokaryote semiotics, sign-mediated interactions in bacteria communities such as quorum sensing and quorum quenching.
*zoosemiotics or animal semiotics,<ref>Timo Maran|Maran, Timo; Dario Martinelli|Martinelli, Dario; Aleksei Turovski|Turovski, Aleksei (eds.), 2011. ''Readings in Zoosemiotics.'' (Semiotics, Communication and Cognition 8.). Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton.</ref> or the study of animal forms of knowing;<ref>Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi 2014. Zoosemiotics is the study of animal forms of knowing. ''Semiotica'' 198: 47–60.[https://www.academia.edu/6116777/Zoosemiotics_is_the_study_of_animal_forms_of_knowing]</ref> animal semiosis occurs in the organisms with neuromuscular system, also includes anthroposemiotics, the study of semiotic behavior in humans.

According to the dominant aspect of semiosis under study, the following labels have been used: biopragmatics, biosemantics, and biosyntactics.

History
Apart from Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) and Charles W. Morris (1903–1979), early pioneers of biosemiotics were Jakob von Uexküll (1864–1944), Heini Hediger (1908–1992), Giorgio Prodi (1928–1987), Marcel Florkin (1900–1979) and Friedrich S. Rothschild (1899–1995); the founding fathers of the contemporary interdiscipline were Thomas Sebeok (1920–2001) and Thure von Uexküll (1908–2004).<ref>Favareau, D. (ed.) (2010).

In the 1980s a circle of mathematicians active in Theoretical Biology, René Thom (Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques), Yannick Kergosien (Dalhousie University and Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques), and Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen (Dalhousie University, also a former member of the Buffalo group with Howard H. Pattee), explored the relations between Semiotics and Biology using such headings as "Nature Semiotics",<ref>Kergosien, Y. (1985) Sémiotique de la Nature, IVe séminaire de l'Ecole d'automne de Biologie Théorique (Solignac, juin 1984), G. BENCHETRIT éd., C.N.R.S.</ref><ref>Kergosien, Y. (1992) Nature Semiotics : The Icons of Nature.  Biosemiotics : The Semiotic Web 1991,  T. Sebeok et J.

The contemporary period (as initiated by Copenhagen-Tartu school)<ref>See an account of recent history in: Petrilli, Susan (2011). ''Expression and Interpretation in Language''. Transaction Publishers, pp. 85–92.</ref> include biologists Jesper Hoffmeyer, Kalevi Kull, Claus Emmeche, Terrence Deacon, semioticians Martin Krampen, Marcel Danesi, philosophers Donald Favareau, John Deely, John Collier (reformer)|John Collier, Guenther Witzany and complex systems scientists Howard H. Pattee, Michael Conrad (biologist)|Michael Conrad, Luis M. Rocha,  Cliff Joslyn and Léon Croizat|León Croizat.

In 2001, an annual international conference for biosemiotic research known as the Gatherings in Biosemiotics<ref>Rattasepp, Silver; Bennett, Tyler (eds.) 2012. [https://www.academia.edu/19524232/Tartu_Semiotics_Library_11_Gatherings_in_Biosemiotics ''Gatherings in Biosemiotics'']. (Tartu Semiotics Library 11.) Tartu: University of Tartu Press.</ref> was inaugurated, and has taken place every year since.

In 2004, a group of biosemioticians – Marcello Barbieri, Claus Emmeche, Jesper Hoffmeyer, Kalevi Kull, and Anton Markos – decided to establish an international journal of biosemiotics. Under their editorship, the ''Journal of Biosemiotics'' was launched by Nova Science Publishers in 2005 (two issues published), and with the same five editors ''Biosemiotics'' was launched by Springer Science|Springer in 2008. The book series ''Biosemiotics'' (Springer, since 2007) is edited by Jesper Hoffmeyer, Kalevi Kull, and Alexei Sharov.

The International Society for Biosemiotic Studies was established in 2005 by Donald Favareau and the five editors listed above.<ref>Favareau, Donald 2005.
