A demonym (IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|m|ə|n|ɪ|m; from Greek language|Greek δῆμος, ''dêmos'',  "people, tribe" and όνομα, ''ónoma'', "name") is a word that identifies residents or natives of a particular place, which is derived from the name of that particular place.<ref name="Scheetz">Cite book|title=Names' Names: A Descriptive and Pervasive Onymicon|author=George H. Scheetz|publisher=Schütz Verlag|year=1988</ref>

Examples of demonyms include ''Cochabambino'', for a person from the city of Cochabamba; ''Americans|American'' for a person from the sovereign state|country called the United States of America; and ''Swahili people|Swahili'', for a person of the Swahili coast.

Demonyms do not always clearly distinguish  place of origin or ethnicity from place of residence or citizenship, and many demonyms overlap with the ethnonym for the ethnically dominant group of a region. Thus a ''Thai'' may be any resident or citizen of Thailand of any ethnic group, or more narrowly a member of the Thai people.

Conversely, some groups of people may be associated with multiple demonyms. For example, a native of the United Kingdom may be called a ''British person'', a ''Briton'' or, informally, a ''Brit''. In some languages, a demonym may be borrowed from another language as a nickname or descriptive adjective for a group of people: for example, "Québécois(e)" is commonly used in English for a native of Quebec (though "Quebecker" is also available).

In English, demonyms are capitalization|capitalized<ref>cite web|url=http://www.mansioningles.com/gram19.htm|title=Gramática Inglesa. Adjetivos Gentilicios|work=mansioningles.com</ref> and are often the same as the adjectival form of the place, e.g. ''Egyptian'', ''Japanese'', or ''Greek''. Significant exceptions exist; for instance, the adjectival form of Spain is "Spanish", but the demonym is "Spaniard".

English commonly uses national demonyms such as "Ethiopian" or "Guatemalan", while the usage of local demonyms such as "Chicagoan", "Okie", or "Parisian", is rare. Many local demonyms are rarely used and many places, especially smaller towns and cities, lack a commonly used and accepted demonym altogether.

Etymology
The word ''gentilic'' comes from the Latin language|Latin ''gentilis'' ("of a clan, or gens") and the English suffix ''-ic''.<ref>cite web|title=Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gentilic|website=Merriam Webster|accessdate=25 July 2015</ref> The word ''demonym'' was derived from the Greek language|Greek word meaning "populace" (lang|grc|δῆμος, ''Glossary of rhetorical terms#D|demos'') with the suffix for "name" (-onym).

''National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic'' attributes the term "demonym" to Merriam-Webster editor Paul Dickson (writer)|Paul Dickson in a recent work from 1990.<ref>cite journal |publisher=National Geographic Society (U.S.) |url=https://books.google.com/?id=krIOAAAAIAAJ&q=demonym&dq=demonym |title=Gentilés, Demonyms: What's in a Name? |journal=National Geographic Magazine |volume=177 |date=February 1990 |page=170</ref> The word did not appear for nouns, adjectives, and verbs derived from geographical names in the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary nor in prominent style manuals such as the ''The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Manual of Style''. It was subsequently popularized in this sense in 1997 by Dickson in his book ''Labels for Locals''.<ref>cite news |work=The New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04EEDB143CF937A25751C1A961958260&scp=1 |date=1997-12-14 |author=William Safire |title=On Language; Gifts of Gab for 1998</ref> However, in ''What Do You Call a Person From...? A Dictionary of Resident Names'' (the first edition of ''Labels for Locals'')<ref>''What Do You Call a Person From...? A Dictionary of Resident Names'' by Paul Dickson (Facts on File, February 1990). ISBN|978-0-8160-1983-0.</ref> Dickson attributed the term to George H. Scheetz, in his ''Names' Names: A Descriptive and Prescriptive Onymicon'' (1988),<ref name="Scheetz"/> which is apparently where the term first appears. The term may have been fashioned after ''demonymic'', which the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' defines as the name of an Athenian citizen according to the deme to which the citizen belongs, with its first use traced to 1893.<ref name="OED">cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/ |title=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press</ref><ref>cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionofat00arisuoft |title=Aristotle's ''Constitution of Athens'', edited by J.E. Sandy, at the Internet Archive |page=116</ref>

Suffixation
Several linguistic elements are used to create demonyms in the English language. The most common is to add a Affix|suffix to the end of the location name, slightly modified in some instances. These may resemble Late Latin, Semitic languages|Semitic, Celtic languages|Celtic, or Germanic languages|Germanic suffixes, such as:

=''-(a)n''=

*Africa → African

"-ese" is usually considered proper only as an adjective, or to refer to the entirety.Citation needed|date=April 2013 Thus, "a Chinese person" is used rather than "a Chinese". Often used for East Asian and Francophone locations, from the similar-sounding French suffix ''-ais(e)'', which is originally from the Latin adjectival ending ''-ensis'', designating origin from a place: thus Hispaniensis (Spanish), Danensis (Danish), etc.

Prefixation
It is much rarer to find Demonyms created with a prefix. Mostly they are from Africa and the Pacific, and are not generally known or used outside the country concerned. In much of East Africa, a person of a particular ethnic group will be denoted by a prefix. For example, a person of the Luba people would be a Muluba, the plural form Baluba, and the language, Kiluba or Tshiluba. Similar patterns with minor variations in the prefixes exist throughout on a tribal level. And Fijians who are indigenous Fijians are known as Kaiviti (Viti being the Fijian name for Fiji). On a country level:
*Botswana → Motswana (singlular), Batswana (plural)
*Burundi → Umurundi (singular), Abarundi (plural)
*Lesotho → Mosotho (singular), Basotho (plural)

In the Pacific, at least two countries use prefixation:
*Kiribati → i-Kiribati
*Vanuatu → Ni-Vanuatu

=Cities=
*Shillong → nong Shillong

Non-standard examples
Demonyms may also not conform to the underlying naming of a particular place, but instead arise out of historical or cultural particularities that become associated with its denizens. These demonyms are usually more informal and colloquial. In the United States such informal demonyms frequently become associated with mascots of the intercollegiate sports teams of the state university system. In other countries the origins are often disputed.Examples|date=December 2018

Fiction
Literature and science fiction have created a wealth of gentilics that are not directly associated with a cultural group. These will typically be formed using the standard models above. Examples include Martian for hypothetical people of Mars (credited to scientist Percival Lowell) or ''Gondorian'' for the people of Tolkien's fictional land of Gondor or ''Atlantean'' for Plato's island ''Atlantis''.

Other science fiction examples include Jovian (fiction)|Jovian for those of Jupiter or its moons, and Venusians|Venusian for those of Venus. Fictional aliens refer to the inhabitants of Earth as Earthling (from the diminutive ''-ling'', ultimately from Old English ''-ing'' meaning "descendant"), as well as "wikt:Terran|Terran", "Terrene", "Tellurian", "Earther", "Earthican", "Terrestrial", and "Solarian" (from Sol, the sun).

Fantasy literature which involves other worlds or other lands also has a rich supply of gentilics. Examples include ''Lilliputians'' and ''Brobdingnagians'', from the islands of Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput and Brobdingnag in the satire ''Gulliver's Travels''.

In a few cases, where a linguistic background has been created, non-standard gentilics are formed (or the eponyms back-formed). Examples include Tolkien's ''Rohirrim'' (from Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan) and the ''Star Trek'' world's ''Klingon'' people (with various version of homeworld name).
