 History and methods 
The first scholarly works about the neural bases of social cognition can be traced back to Phineas Gage, a man who survived a traumatic brain injury in 1849 and was extensively studied for resultant changes in social functioning and personality.<ref name=":10">Cite journal|date=2012-06-01|title=A geographical history of social cognitive neuroscience|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912001164|journal=NeuroImage|language=en|volume=61|issue=2|pages=432–436|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.12.089|pmid=22309803|issn=1053-8119|last1=Lieberman|first1=Matthew D.</ref> In 1924, esteemed psychologist Gordon Allport wrote a chapter on the neural bases of social phenomenon in his textbook of social psychology.<ref>Cite book|title=Social psychology|last=Henry.|first=Allport, Floyd|date=1994|publisher=Routledge/Thoemmes|oclc=312005054</ref> However, these works did not generate much activity in the decades that followed. The beginning of modern social cognitive neuroscience can be traced to Michael Gazzaniga's book, ''Social Brain'' (1985), which attributed Lateralization of brain function|cerebral lateralization to the peculiarities of social psychological phenomenon. Isolated pockets of social cognitive neuroscience research emerged in the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, mostly using Single-unit recording|single-unit electrophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates or Neuropsychology|neuropsychological lesion studies in humans.<ref name=":10" /> During this time, the closely related field of social neuroscience emerged in parallel, however it mostly focused on how social factors influenced Autonomic nervous system|autonomic, Neuroendocrine System|neuroendocrine, and immune systems.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":11">Cite book|last=Amodio|first=David M.|last2=Ratner|first2=Kyle G.|date=2013-08-22|title=The Neuroscience of Social Cognition|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Social Cognition|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199730018.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199730018-e-034|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199730018.001.0001|isbn=9780199730018</ref> In 1996, Giacomo Rizzolatti's group made one of the most seminal discoveries in social cognitive neuroscience: the existence of mirror neurons in macaque frontoparietal cortex.<ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /> The mid-1990s saw the emergence of functional positron emission tomography (PET) for humans, which enabled the neuroscientific study of abstract (and perhaps uniquely human) social cognitive functions such as theory of mind and mentalizing. However, PET is prohibitively expensive and requires the ingestion of radioactive tracers, thus limiting its adoption.<ref name=":10" />

In the year 2000, the term ''social cognitive neuroscience'' was coined by Matthew Lieberman and Kevin Oschner, who are from Social psychology|social and cognitive psychology backgrounds, respectively. This was done to integrate and brand the isolated labs doing research on the neural bases of social cognition.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":10" /> Also in the year 2000, Elizabeth A.

In 2001, the first academic conference on social cognitive neuroscience was held at University of California, Los Angeles. The mid-2000s saw the emergence of academic societies related to the field (''[http://socialaffectiveneuro.org Social and Affective Neuroscience Society], Society for Social Neuroscience''), as well as Academic journal|peer-reviewed journals specialized for the field (''Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, Social Neuroscience'').<ref name=":10" /> In the 2000s and beyond, labs conducting social cognitive neuroscience research proliferated throughout Europe, North America, East Asia, Australasia, and South America.<ref>Cite web|url=http://socialaffectiveneuro.org/labs.html|title=The Social and Affective Neuroscience Society - Labs|website=socialaffectiveneuro.org|access-date=2018-12-04</ref><ref name=":10" /><ref name=":11" />

 Functional anatomy 

Much of social cognition is primarily subserved by two dissociable Large scale brain networks|macro-scale brain networks: the mirror neuron|mirror neuron system (MNS) and default mode network (DMN). MNS is thought to represent and identify observable actions (e.g. reaching for a cup) that are used by DMN to infer unobservable mental states, traits, and intentions (e.g. thirsty).<ref name=":4">Cite journal|date=2015-11-01|title=Understanding intentions from actions: Direct perception, inference, and the roles of mirror and mentalizing systems|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|language=en|volume=36|pages=426–433|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2015.03.012|pmid=25864592|issn=1053-8100|last1=Catmur|first1=Caroline|url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/807549/1/CatmurIntentionUnderstandingConscCog2015.pdf</ref><ref name=":0" /><ref name=Theoryofmind2006/><ref name=":6">Cite journal|last=Molnar-Szakacs|first=Istvan|last2=Uddin|first2=Lucina Q.|date=2013|title=Self-Processing and the Default Mode Network: Interactions with the Mirror Neuron System|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|language=English|volume=7|pages=571|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00571|pmid=24062671|pmc=3769892|issn=1662-5161</ref> Concordantly, the activation onset of MNS has been shown to precede DMN during social cognition.<ref name=":4" /> However, the extent of feed forward (control)|feedforward, feedback, and wikt:recurrent|recurrent processing within and between MNS and DMN is not yet well-characterized, thus it is difficult to fully dissociate the exact functions of the two networks and their nodes.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4" /><ref name=":6" />

Mechanistic theories of MNS functioning fall broadly into two camps: motor and cognitive theories. Classical motor theories claim that abstract action representations arise from simulating actions within the motor system, while newer cognitive theories propose that abstract action representations arise from the integration of multiple domains of information: Perception|perceptual, Motor system|motor, Semantics|semantic, and conceptual.<ref name="Lingnau2015">cite journal|last1=Lingnau|first1=A|last2=Downing|first2=PE|date=May 2015|title=The lateral occipitotemporal cortex in action.|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=19|issue=5|pages=268–77|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.03.006|pmid=25843544</ref><ref name=":7" /> Aside from these competing theories, there are more fundamental controversies surrounding the human MNS – even the very existence of mirror neurons in this network is debated.<ref>Cite journal|last=Caramazza|first=Alfonso|last2=Anzellotti|first2=Stefano|last3=Strnad|first3=Lukas|last4=Lingnau|first4=Angelika|date=2014-07-08|title=Embodied Cognition and Mirror Neurons: A Critical Assessment|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1146/annurev-neuro-071013-013950|pmid=25032490|issn=0147-006X</ref><ref name="Hickok2009" /> As such, the term "MNS" is sometimes eschewed for more functionally defined names such as "action observation network", "action identification network", and "action representation network".<ref name="Hickok2009">Cite journal|last=Hickok|first=Gregory|date=July 2009|title=Eight Problems for the Mirror Neuron Theory of Action Understanding in Monkeys and Humans|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|language=EN|volume=21|issue=7|pages=1229–1243|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21189|pmc=2773693|pmid=19199415 update inline|date=November 2018</ref>

 Premotor cortex 

The macaque premotor cortex was the location of the first discoveries of mirror neurons.<ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /> The premotor cortex is associated with a diverse array of functions, encompassing low-level motor control, motor planning, sensory guidance of movement, along with higher level cognitive functions such as Language processing in the brain|language processing and action comprehension.<ref name="Graziano2007">cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=MS|last2=Aflalo|first2=TN|date=25 October 2007|title=Mapping behavioral repertoire onto the cortex.|journal=Neuron|volume=56|issue=2|pages=239–51|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.09.013|pmid=17964243 open access update inline|date=November 2018</ref> The premotor cortex has been found to contain subregions with unique Cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitectural properties, the significance of which is not yet fully understood.<ref>Cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael S.A.|date=2016-02-01|title=Ethological Action Maps: A Paradigm Shift for the Motor Cortex|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=121–132|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.10.008|issn=1364-6613|pmid=26628112</ref> In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses are also found throughout premotor cortex and adjacent sections of inferior frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area.<ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /><ref name="Rizzolatti2008" />

Visuospatial information is more prevalent in ventral premotor cortex than dorsal premotor cortex.<ref name="Graziano2007" /> In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses extend beyond ventral premotor cortex into adjacent regions of inferior frontal gyrus, including Broca's area, an area that is critical to language processing and speech production.<ref name="Nishitani2005">cite journal|last1=Nishitani|first1=N|last2=Schürmann|first2=M|last3=Amunts|first3=K|last4=Hari|first4=R|date=February 2005|title=Broca's region: from action to language.|journal=Physiology|volume=20|pages=60–9|doi=10.1152/physiol.00043.2004|pmid=15653841 open access update inline|date=November 2018</ref> Action representations in inferior frontal gyrus can be evoked by language, such as action verbs, in addition to the observed and performed actions typically used as stimuli in biological motion studies.<ref name=":2" /> The overlap between language and action understanding processes in inferior frontal gyrus has spurred some researchers to suggest overlapping neurocomputational mechanisms between the two.<ref name="Nishitani2005" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" /> Dorsal premotor cortex is strongly associated with motor preparation and guidance, such as representing multiple motor choices and deciding the final selection of action.<ref name="Graziano2007" />

 Intraparietal sulcus 
Classical studies of action observation have found mirror neurons in macaque intraparietal sulcus.<ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /> In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses are centered around the anterior intraperietal sulcus, with responses also seen in adjacent regions such as inferior parietal lobule and superior parietal lobule. Intraparietal sulcus has been shown to more sensitive to the motor features of biological motion, relative to semantic features.<ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /> Intraparietal sulcus has been shown to encode magnitude in a domain-general manner, whether it be the magnitude of a motor movement, or the magnitude of a person's social status.<ref name=":13">Cite journal|last=Parkinson|first=Carolyn|last2=Wheatley|first2=Thalia|date=2015-03-01|title=The repurposed social brain|url=https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(15)00004-2|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=English|volume=19|issue=3|pages=133–141|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.01.003|issn=1879-307X|pmid=25732617|via=</ref> Intraparietal sulcus is considered a part of the two streams hypothesis|dorsal visual stream, but is also thought to receive inputs from non-dorsal stream regions such as lateral occipitotemporal cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus.<ref name="Rizzolatti2008" />

 Lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) 
LOTC encompasses lateral regions of the visual cortex such as Visual cortex#Middle temporal visual area (V5)|V5 and extrastriate body area. Though LOTC is typically associated with visual processing, sensorimotor mirroring responses and abstract action representations are reliably found in this region.<ref name="Lingnau2015" /><ref name="Downing2011">cite journal|last1=Downing|first1=PE|last2=Peelen|first2=MV|date=2011|title=The role of occipitotemporal body-selective regions in person perception.|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=2|issue=3–4|pages=186–203|doi=10.1080/17588928.2011.582945|pmid=24168534</ref> LOTC includes cortical areas that are sensitive to motion, objects, body parts, kinematics, body postures, observed movements, and semantic content in verbs.<ref name=Lingnau2015/><ref name="Downing2011" /> LOTC is thought to encode the fine sensorimotor details of an observed action (e.g. local kinematic and perceptual features).<ref name=Downing2011/> LOTC is also thought to bind together the different means by which a specific action can be carried out.<ref name=Lingnau2015/>

 Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 
Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is strongly associated with abstract social cognition such as mentalizing and theory of mind.<ref name=":22">Cite journal|last=Denny|first=Bryan T.|last2=Kober|first2=Hedy|last3=Wager|first3=Tor D.|last4=Ochsner|first4=Kevin N.|date=August 2012|title=A Meta-analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Studies of Self- and Other Judgments Reveals a Spatial Gradient for Mentalizing in Medial Prefrontal Cortex|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|language=en|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1742–1752|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00233|issn=0898-929X|pmc=3806720|pmid=22452556</ref><ref name=":0" /><ref name=Theoryofmind2006/><ref name=":5" /> Mentalizing about others activates much of the mPFC, but Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex|dorsal mPFC appears to be more selective for information about other people, while the Brodmann area 10|middle mPFC may be more selective for information about the self.<ref name=":22" />

Ventral regions of mPFC, such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex, are thought to play a critical role in the Affect (psychology)|affective components of social cognition. For example, ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been found to represent affective information about other people.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":14" /><ref name=":19" /> Ventral mPFC has been shown to be critical in the computation and representation of Valence (psychology)|valence and value for many types of stimuli, not just social stimuli.<ref>Cite journal|date=2011-02-01|title=Emotional processing in anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=85–93|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.11.004|pmid=21167765|pmc=3035157|issn=1364-6613|last1=Etkin|first1=Amit|last2=Egner|first2=Tobias|last3=Kalisch|first3=Raffael</ref>

The mPFC may subserve the most abstract components of social cognition, as it is one of the most domain general brain regions, sits at the top of the cortical heirarchy, and is last to activate during DMN-related tasks.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":17" /><ref>Cite journal|date=2018-01-01|title=Large-Scale Gradients in Human Cortical Organization|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21–31|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2017.11.002|pmid=29203085|issn=1364-6613|last1=Huntenburg|first1=Julia M.|last2=Bazin|first2=Pierre-Louis|last3=Margulies|first3=Daniel S.|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002E-88F2-D</ref>

 Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) 
Abstract social cognition recruits a large area of posteromedial cortex centered around posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), but also extending into precuneus and retrosplenial cortex.<ref name=":14" /><ref name=":0" /> The specific function of PCC in social cognition is not yet well characterized,<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":15" /> and its role may be generalized and tightly linked with medial prefrontal cortex.<ref name=":14" /><ref name=":18" /> One view is that PCC may help represent some visuospatial and semantic components of social cognition.<ref>Cite journal|last=Trés|first=Eduardo Sturzeneker|last2=Brucki|first2=Sonia Maria Dozzi|date=2014|title=Visuospatial processing: A review from basic to current concepts|journal=Dementia & Neuropsychologia|volume=8|issue=2|pages=175–181|doi=10.1590/S1980-57642014DN82000014|issn=1980-5764|pmc=5619126|pmid=29213900</ref> Additionally, PCC may track social dynamics by facilitating bottom-up attention to behaviorally relevant sources of information in the external environment and in memory.<ref name=":18" /> Dorsal PCC is also linked to monitoring behaviorally relevant changes in the environment, perhaps aiding in social navigation.<ref name=":19" /> Outside of the social domain, PCC is associated with a very diverse array of functions, such as attention, memory, semantics, visual processing, mindwandering, consciousness, cognitive flexibility, and mediating interactions between brain networks.<ref>Cite journal|last=Leech|first=Robert|last2=Sharp|first2=David J.|date=2013-07-18|title=The role of the posterior cingulate cortex in cognition and disease|url=https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/137/1/12/358120|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=137|issue=1|pages=12–32|doi=10.1093/brain/awt162|pmid=23869106|pmc=3891440|issn=1460-2156</ref>

 Temporoparietal junction (TPJ) 
See also|Angular gyrus|
The temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is thought to be critical to distinguishing between multiple agents, such as the self and other.<ref name=":5" /> The right TPJ is robustly activated by false belief tasks, in which subjects have to distinguish between others' beliefs and their own beliefs in a given situation.<ref name="Theoryofmind2006" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":0" /> The TPJ is also recruited by the wide variety of abstract social cognitive tasks associated with the DMN.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":14" /><ref name=":19" /> Outside of the social domain, TPJ is associated with a diverse array of functions such as attentional reorienting, target detection, contextual updating, language processing, and episodic memory retrieval.<ref>Cite journal|last=Krall|first=S.

 Superior temporal sulcus (STS) 
Social tasks recruit areas of lateral temporal cortex centered around superior temporal sulcus (STS), but also extending to superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and the temporal poles.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":15" /> During social cognition, the anterior STS and temporal poles are strongly associated with abstract social cognition and person information, while the posterior STS is most associated with social vision and biological motion processing.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":0" /> The posterior STS is also thought to provide perceptual inputs to the mirror neuron system.<ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /><ref name=":4" />

= Other regions =
There are also several brain regions that fall outside the MNS and DMN which are strongly associated with certain social cognitive functions.<ref name=":3" />

 Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) 
The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is associated with emotional and Inhibitory control|inhibitory processing. It has been found to be involved in emotion recognition from facial expressions, body language, prosody (linguistics)|prosody, and more. Specifically, it is thought to access semantic representations of emotional constructs during emotion recognition.<ref>Cite journal|date=2016-12-01|title=Perceiving emotional expressions in others: Activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses of explicit evaluation, passive perception and incidental perception of emotions|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763416303852|journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews|language=en|volume=71|pages=810–828|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.10.020|pmid=27836460|issn=0149-7634|last1=Dricu|first1=Mihai|last2=Frühholz|first2=Sascha</ref> Moreover, VLPFC is often recruited in empathy, mentalizing, and theory of mind tasks. VLPFC is thought to support the inhibition of self-perspective when thinking about other people.<ref name=":3" />

 Insula 
The Insular cortex|insula is critical to emotional processing and interoception. It has been found to be involved in emotion recognition, empathy, morality, and social pain. The anterior insula is thought to facilitate feeling the emotions of others, especially negative emotions such as vicarious pain. Lesions of the insula are associated with decreased empathy capacity. Anterior insula also activates during social pain, such as the pain caused by social rejection.<ref name=":12">Cite journal|date=2017-06-29|title=Imaging empathy and prosocial emotions|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394017305463|journal=Neuroscience Letters|language=en|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2017.06.054|pmid=28668381|issn=0304-3940|last1=Lamm|first1=Claus|last2=Rütgen|first2=Markus|last3=Wagner|first3=Isabella C.</ref><ref name=":3" />

 Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) 
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is associated with emotional processing and error monitoring. The dorsal ACC appears to share some social cognitive functions to the anterior insula, such as facilitating feeling the emotions of others, especially negative emotions. The dorsal ACC also robustly activates during social pain, like the pain caused by being the victim of an injustice. The dorsal ACC is also associated with social evaluation, such as the detection and appraisal of social exclusion. The Brodmann area 25|subgenual ACC has been found to activate for vicarious reward, and may be involved in prosocial behavior.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":3" />

 Fusiform face area (FFA) 
The fusiform face area (FFA) is strongly associated with face processing and perceptual expertise. The FFA has been shown to process the visuospatial features of faces, and may also encode some semantic features of faces.<ref name=":20">Cite journal|last=Adolphs|first=Ralph|last2=Spunt|first2=Robert P.|date=September 2017|title=A new look at domain specificity: insights from social neuroscience|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2017.76|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|language=en|volume=18|issue=9|pages=559–567|doi=10.1038/nrn.2017.76|pmid=28680161|issn=1471-0048</ref><ref name=":3" />
