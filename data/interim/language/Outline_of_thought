The following Outline (list)|outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to thought (thinking):

Thought (also called thinking) &ndash; the mental process in which beings form psychological associations and model (abstract)|models of the world.  Thinking is manipulating information, as when we form concepts, engage in problem solving, reason and make choice|decisions.  Thought, the act of thinking, produces thoughts.  A thought may be an idea, an image, a sound or even an emotional feeling that arises from the brain.

 Nature of thought 

Thought (or thinking) can be described as all of the following:

* An activity taking place in a:
** brain &ndash; organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals (only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain). It is the physical structure associated with the mind.
*** mind &ndash; abstract entity with the cognition|cognitive faculties of consciousness, perception, thought|thinking, judgement, and memory. Having a mind is a characteristic of living creatures.<ref name="dict">Dictionary.com, "mind": "1. (in a human or other <u>conscious being</u>) the element, part, substance, or process that reasons, thinks, feels, wills, perceives, judges, etc.: <u>the processes of the mind</u>. 2. Psychology. the totality of <u>conscious and unconscious mental processes</u> and activities. 3. intellect or understanding, as distinguished from the faculties of feeling and willing; <u>intelligence</u>."</ref><ref>Google definition, "mind": "The <u>element</u> of a person that enables them to be aware of the world and their experiences, to think, and to feel; the faculty of consciousness." [https://www.google.com/search?q=Mind#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=definition+of+mind&oq=definition+of+mind]</ref> Activities taking place in a mind are called mental processes or cognitive functions.
** computer (see section link||Machine thought below) &ndash; general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations (an algorithm) can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
* An activity of intelligence &ndash; intelligence is the intellectual prowess of  which is marked by cognition, motivation, and self-awareness.<ref>cite book|last1=Tirri, Nokelainen|title=Measuring Multiple Intelligences and Moral Sensitivities in Education|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-6091-758-5|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789460917585</ref> Through intelligence, living creatures possess the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, understand, apply logic, and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, comprehend ideas, plan, problem solve, make decisions, retaining, and use language to communicate. Intelligence enables living creatures to experience and think.
** A type of mental process &ndash; something that individuals can do with their minds. Mental processes include perception, memory, thinking, volition, and emotion. Sometimes the term ''cognitive function'' is used instead.
* Thought as a biological adaptation mechanism<ref name=Nikolic2014>cite web|url=http://www.danko-nikolic.com/?smd_process_download=1&download_id=724|title=Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. arXiv:1402.5332 [q-bio.NC].|author=Danko Nikolić|date=2014</ref>

 Problem solving 

Problem solving
columns-list|colwidth=30em|

* Problem solving steps
** Problem finding
** Problem shaping
* Process of elimination
* Systems thinking
** Critical systems thinking
* Problem-solving strategy &ndash; steps one would use to find the problem(s) that are in the way to getting to one’s own goal. Some would refer to this as the ‘problem-solving cycle’ (Bransford & Stein, 1993). In this cycle one will recognize the problem, define the problem, develop a strategy to fix the problem, organize the knowledge of the problem cycle, figure-out the resources at the user's disposal, monitor one's progress, and evaluate the solution for accuracy.
** Abstraction &ndash;  solving the problem in a model of the system before applying it to the real system
** Analogy &ndash;  using a solution that solves an analogous problem
** Brainstorming &ndash;  (especially among groups of people) suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found
** Analysis|Divide and conquer &ndash;  breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems
** Hypothesis testing &ndash;  assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or, in some contexts, disprove) the assumption
** Lateral thinking &ndash;  approaching solutions indirectly and creatively
** Means-ends analysis &ndash;  choosing an action at each step to move closer to the goal
** Method of focal objects &ndash;  synthesizing seemingly non-matching characteristics of different objects into something new
** Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|Morphological analysis &ndash;  assessing the output and interactions of an entire system
** Proof (truth)|Proof &ndash;  try to prove that the problem cannot be solved. The point where the proof fails will be the starting point for solving it
** Reduction (complexity)|Reduction &ndash;  transforming the problem into another problem for which solutions exist
** Research &ndash;  employing existing ideas or adapting existing solutions to similar problems
** Root cause analysis &ndash;  identifying the cause of a problem
** Trial-and-error &ndash;  testing possible solutions until the right one is found

Reasoning
columns-list|colwidth=30em|

* Abstraction|Abstract thinking
* Adaptive reasoning
* Analogy|Analogical reasoning
* Analytic reasoning
* Case-based reasoning
* Critical thinking
* Defeasible reasoning &ndash; from authority: if ''p'' then (defeasibly) ''q''
* Diagrammatic reasoning &ndash; reasoning by means of visual representations. Visualizing concepts and ideas with of diagrams and imagery instead of by linguistic or algebraic means
* Emotional reasoning (erroneous) &ndash; a cognitive distortion in which emotion overpowers reason, to the point the subject is unwilling or unable to accept the reality of a situation because of it.
* Fallacious reasoning (erroneous) &ndash; logical errors
* Heuristics
* Historical thinking
* Intuitive reasoning
* Lateral thinking
* Logic / Logical reasoning
** Abductive reasoning &ndash; from data and theory:  ''p'' and ''q'' are correlated, and ''q'' is sufficient for ''p''; hence, if ''p'' then (abducibly) ''q'' as cause
** Deductive reasoning &ndash; from meaning postulate, axiom, or contingent assertion: if ''p'' then ''q'' (i.e., ''q'' or ''not-p'')
** Inductive reasoning &ndash; theory formation; from data, coherence, simplicity, and confirmation: (inducibly) "if ''p'' then ''q''"; hence, if ''p'' then (deducibly-but-revisably) ''q''
** Inference
* Moral reasoning &ndash; process in which an individual tries to determine the difference between what is right and what is wrong in a personal situation by using logic.<ref>cite web|title=Definition of: Moral Reasoning|url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Moral%20Reasoning|accessdate=21 July 2011</ref>  This is an important and often daily process that people use in an attempt to do the right thing.  Every day for instance, people are faced with the dilemma of whether or not to lie in a given situation.  People make this decision by reasoning the morality of the action and weighing that against its consequences.
* Probabilistic reasoning &ndash; from combinatorics and indifference: if ''p'' then (probably) ''q''
* Proportional reasoning &ndash; using "the concept of proportions when analyzing and solving a mathematical situation."<ref>cite web|url=http://quizlet.com/dictionary/proportional-reasoning/|title=Dictionary Search › proportional reasoning - Quizlet|publisher=</ref>
* Rational thinking
* Semiosis
* Statistical reasoning &ndash; from data and presumption:  the frequency of ''q''s among ''p''s is high (or inference from a model fit to data); hence, (in the right context) if ''p'' then (probably) ''q''
* Synthetic reasoning
* Verbal reasoning &ndash; understanding and reasoning using concepts framed in words
* Visual reasoning &ndash; process of manipulating one's mental image of an object in order to reach a certain conclusion – for example, mentally constructing a piece of machinery to experiment with different mechanisms
