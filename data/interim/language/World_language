A world language is spoken internationally and is learned and spoken by a large number of people as a second language. A world language is characterized not only by the total number of speakers (native and second language speakers), but also by its geographical distribution, as well as use in international organizations and diplomatic relations.<ref name="weltalmanach.de">Cite book |url=http://www.weltalmanach.de/stichwort/stichwort_weltsprachen.html |title=Fischer Weltalmanach |publisher=S.

 Overview 

=Asian languages=

Arabic
Arabic language|Arabic gained international prominence because of the medieval Islamic conquests and the subsequent Arabization of the Middle East and North Africa, and it is also a liturgical language amongst Muslim communities outside the Arab World.

Chinese
Standard Chinese is the direct replacement of Classical Chinese, which was a historical lingua franca in Far East Asia until the early 20th century, and today serves as a common language between speakers of other varieties of Chinese not only within China proper (between the Han Chinese and other unrelated ethnic groups), but in overseas Chinese communities. It is also widely taught as a second language internationally.

Indian languages
The Languages of India|major languages of the Indian subcontinent have numbers of speakers comparable to those of major world languages primarily due to the large population in the region rather than a supra-regional use of these languages, although Hindustani language|Hindustani (including all Hindi dialects, and Urdu), Bengali language|Bengali and Tamil language|Tamil may fulfill the criteria in terms of supra-regional usage and international recognition.fact|date=August 2018 As an example, the native speaking population of Bengali language|Bengali vastly outnumber those who speak French as a first language, and it is one of the List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken languages (ranking fifth<ref name="eth">Cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/country |title=Summary by country |website=Ethnologue |access-date=2018-09-22</ref> or sixth<ref name=Encarta>cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.html |title=Languages Spoken by More Than 10 Million People |accessdate=2007-02-18 |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109093116/http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.html |archivedate=January 9, 2006 </ref>) in the world with nearly 230 million total speakers, and is known for its long and rich literary tradition.

English
In addition to 370 million native speakers, English is estimated to have over 610 million second-language speakers,<ref name=":0" /> including anywhere between 200 and 350 million learners/users in China alone,<ref name="Wei Su 2012">cite journal|last=Wei|first=Rining|author2=Jinzhi Su|title=The statistics of English in China|journal=English Today|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=28|issue=03|year=2012|pages=10–14|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266078412000235|doi=10.1017/s0266078412000235|accessdate=30 October 2016</ref> at varying levels of study and proficiency, though this number is difficult to accurately assess.<ref name="Crystal2006">Cite book |url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511791154&cid=CBO9780511791154A019 |title=A History of the English Language |last=Crystal |first=David |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |editor-last=Hogg |editor-first=Richard |pages=420-439 |chapter=9 - English worldwide |editor-last2=Denison |editor-first2=David</ref> English is also increasingly becoming the dominant language of scientific research and papers worldwide, having even outpaced national languages in Western European countries, including France, where a recent study showed that English has massively displaced French as the language of scientific research in "hard" as well as in applied sciences.<ref>Cite journal |last=Héran |first=François |date=June 2013 |title=No English please!

French
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, French language|French was the language of communication and diplomacy, and the favoured second language among the elite and the educated classes in Europe (including Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Ukraine) - as well as in many Middle East and North African countries such as Syria, Egypt, Ottoman Turkey and Iran. In addition, French enjoyed high status in some southeast Asian countries (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia), and several South American ones like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. However, French has declined steadily since World War I, being gradually displaced by English - although in Lebanon, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, French continues to be the favoured second language, as well as enjoying co-official status in Canada, Switzerland and Belgium. Moreover, French still remains one of the working languages of many international organizations, including the United Nations, NATO, European Union and NAFTA. French is the principal working language of the European Court of Justice. French is also internationally recognized to be of high linguistic prestige, still used in diplomacy and international commerce, as well as having a significant portion of second language speakers throughout the world.<ref>Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/official-languages/ |title=Official Languages |website=United Nations |access-date=2016-10-29</ref>

German
German language|German served as a lingua franca in large portions of Europe for centuries, mainly the Holy Roman Empire and later the Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire. It remains an important second language in much of Central and Eastern Europe, and in the international scientific community. It is the most widely spoken native language in the European Union as well as one of the three "procedural languages" of its institutions alongside English and French.<ref>Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-825_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Frequently asked questions on languages in Europe|website=europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11</ref> It is the second most commonly used language on websites worldwide after English language|English.<ref>cite web |url=http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language/all |title=Usage Statistics of Content Languages for Websites|access-date=August 6, 2018|publisher= </ref>

Russian was used in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, and its teaching was made compulsory in the Eastern Bloc countries. However, the use and teaching of Russian has declined sharply in both the former Eastern bloc and the near abroad since the break up of the Soviet Union and Russia’s deputy education minister was quoted as saying in December 2013 that the number of Russian speakers had fallen by 100 million since that date.<ref>Cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/01/russias-waning-soft-power-in-central-asia/ |title=Russia’s Waning Soft Power in Central Asia |last=Blank  |first=Stephen |date=9 January 2015 |website=The Diplomat</ref><ref>Cite news |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/71376 |title=Kyrgyzstan’s Russian-Language Teaching Getting Squeezed Out |  |date=15 December 2014 |work=Eurasianet |language=en</ref><ref>Cite news |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/english-replaces-russian-as-top-foreign-language-of-study-in-ex-soviet-georgia/1528063.html |title=English Replaces Russian as Top Foreign Language of Study in Ex-Soviet Georgia |last=Brooke |first=James |date=17 October 2012 |work=VOA News</ref> It is still widely spoken throughout the Caucasus, Central Asia, Eastern Europe and the Baltic states.

Spanish
Spanish language|Spanish is the List of languages by number of native speakers|world's second-most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese. Spanish was used in the Spanish Empire and today is in use in Spain, in Latin American countries (except Brazil, French Guyana, Suriname, Guiana, Haiti and other Caribbean islands), and is spoken in many parts of the United States, particularly in Florida and the states which border Mexico. Indeed, by 2013 Spanish was the most widely taught non-English language in American secondary schools and schools of higher education.<ref>Citation |last=Goldberg |first=David |title=Enrollments in Languages Other Than English in United States Institutions of Higher Education, Fall 2013 |date=February 2015 |url=https://www.mla.org/content/download/31180/1452509/EMB_enrllmnts_nonEngl_2013.pdf |publisher=Modern Language Association of America |access-date=May 11, 2017 |last2=Looney |first2=Dennis  |last3=Lusin |first3=Natalia</ref> It is also an Official languages of the United Nations|official language of the United Nations.

 History 
Historical languages which had international significance as the ''lingua franca'' of a historical empire include Egyptian language|Egyptian in Ancient Egypt; Sumerian language|Sumerian, Akkadian language|Akkadian and Aramaic language|Aramaic in the various Mesopotamian civilizations and empires in the Ancient Near East; Ancient Greek in the Greek colonies in the form of various dialects, evolving to Koine Greek in the Hellenistic world, after the conquests of Alexander the Great and the Macedonian Empire, and subsequently in the Greek East and Latin West|eastern part of the Roman Empire and the territories of the Byzantine Empire; Latin in the Roman Empire and presently as the standard liturgical language for the Catholic faithful worldwide; Classical Chinese in East Asia during the Imperial era of Chinese history; Persian language|Persian during the various succeeding Persian Empires, and once served as the second lingua franca of the Islamic World after Arabic;<ref>Cite book |title=Islam: Religion, History, and Civilization |last=Nasr  |first=Seyyed Hossein |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2003</ref> Sanskrit during the ancient and medieval historical periods of various states in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia, and like Latin an important liturgical language of the Vedic mythology|Vedic religions.

The Romance languages bear testimony to the role of Latin as the ''lingua franca'' of the Roman Empire; for example, Italian language|Italian has always been important in the Mediterranean region, and nowadays it is the most-spoken language among members of the Roman catholic hierarchy and it is also used in music (especially Opera) and the fashion industry. Turkish language|Turkish was similarly important as the primary language of the Ottoman Empire. Koine Greek was the "world language" of the Hellenistic period, but its distribution is not reflected in the distribution of Modern Greek due to the linguistic impact of the Slavs|Slavic, Muslim conquests|Arabic and Turkic migration|Turkic expansions. The distribution of the Arabic and Turkic languages, in turn, are a legacy of the Caliphates and the Turkic Khaganate, respectively.

Just as all the living world languages owe their status to linguistic imperialism, the suggestion of a given language as a world language or "universal language" has strong political implications. Thus, Russian was declared the "world language of proletarian internationalism|internationalism" in Soviet literature, which at the same time denounced French as the "language of fancy courtiers" and English as the "jargon of traders".<ref name="Pei105">Pei, p. 105</ref> A number of international auxiliary languages have been introduced as prospective world languages, the most successful of them being Esperanto, but none were learned by as many people as the world languages were.  Many natural languages have been proffered as candidates for a global ''lingua franca''.<ref name="Pei105"/>

Living world languages
Some sources<ref>Cite web |url=https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-world-language.htm |title=What Is a World Language? (with pictures) |website=wisegeek.com</ref><ref>cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/11/what-global-language/378425/|title=What Global Language?|first=Barbara|last=Wallraff|publisher=</ref> define a living world language as having the following properties:
* a large number of speakers
* a substantial fraction of non-native speakers (function as ''lingua franca'')
* official language|official status in several countries
* use across several regions in the world 
* a linguistic community not defined strictly along ethnicity|ethnic lines (multiethnic, pluricentric language)
* one or more standard language|standard registers which are widely language education|taught as a foreign language
* association with prestige (sociolinguistics)|linguistic prestige
* use in international trade relations
*List of official languages by institution|use in international organizations
* use in the academic community
* significant body of literature
 
Certain languages with greater than 100 million speakers, such as Japanese language|Japanese, are not listed. Japanese, although considered to be one of the most significant languages internationally, along with the listed world languages,<ref>cite web|url=http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm|title=The World's 10 most influential Languages|publisher=</ref> it is not considered a world language ''per se''. Japan as a region is nearly homogeneous from ethnic, cultural and linguistic standpoints. Thus Japanese has little history as a ''lingua franca'' amongst communities who do not share a mother tongue or first language; their overseas communities are strongly tied to ethnicity. While international interest since the 1980s has prompted many major universities, secondary schools, and even primary schools worldwide to Japanese language education|offer courses in the language, Japanese only exerts a regionally limited sphere of influence.<ref>''cf.''

Notes
:note|Alpha|α In contrast to other pluricentric languages (e.g., Arabic or Malay), Ethnologue only lists "Standard German", thereby excluding Swiss German and numerous other varieties of German. Summing up Standard German as well as all undisputed German dialects/varieties (see ISO-list in infobox at German language) that are not listed under "Standard German" results in ca. 90 M native speakers. Furthermore, Ammon (2014)<ref name="Ammon, 2014"/> points out that Ethnologue overestimates L2 speakers, thus underestimating L1 speakers, in Germany by 5M --> 95M L1 speakers.
