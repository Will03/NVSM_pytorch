The network's agenda appears on its Foundation Document. The document outlines the objectives of a doctoral program in Translation Studies and the activities required so that students in these programs can acquire the necessary competences.  Its aims include the following: promoting the cooperation between existing doctoral programs;  developing a database of online course materials such as model syllabi, presentations and video lectures; providing training for supervisors; compiling a list of translation scholars willing to supervise and co-supervise PhDs in their fields of expertise; facilitating joint doctorates, especially those involving different countries; assisting students whose research work necessitates travelling to other countries; organizing ID-TS students' conferences; tightening the collaboration with the industry and governmental and non-governmental institutions; raising external funding for the activities of the network. <ref name="foundation2" />
