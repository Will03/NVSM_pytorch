Spatial cognition is concerned with the acquisition, organization, utilization, and revision of knowledge about spatial environments. These capabilities enable humans to manage basic and high-level Cognition|cognitive tasks in everyday life. Numerous disciplines (such as Psychology, Geographic information science|Geographic Information Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cartography, etc.) work together to understand spatial cognition in humans and in technical systems. Spatial cognition studies have helped to link cognitive psychology and neuroscience together. Scientists in both fields work together to figure out what role spatial cognition plays in the brain as well as the neurobiological infrastructure that surrounds it. Spatial cognition is closely related to how people talk about their environment, find their way in new surroundings, and plan routes.<ref>Thora Tenbrink, Jan M.
