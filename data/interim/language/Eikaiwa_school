Although the Japanese Education in Japan|public education system mandates that English be taught as part of the curriculum from the fifth grade, the focus is generally on English grammar.<ref> cf Zoom High School English-Okihara Katsuaki, Clyde Davenport</ref> Some students attend ''eikaiwa'' schools to supplement their school studies, to study a second language, to improve their business skills, as a hobby, to help socialize, or to prepare for travel or marriage.<ref name=reimag>cite book | last = Ninnes | first = Peter | title = Re-Imagining Comparative Education  | publisher = Routledge  | year = 2004 | pages = 118 | isbn = 0-415-94817-7 </ref> Many parents send their children to these schools in the hope of improving their child's hopes of higher education, or to provide exposure to the ways and manners of people from other cultures.  Contracted foreign teachers are often the principal selling point of an eikaiwa business.

Schools
The major chains of commercial language schools have branches in cities and towns throughout Japan, and there are large numbers of smaller independent outfits. Several chains offer instruction in other languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese, and Korean. These languages are taught primarily at larger city branches or through videoconferencing.<ref name=washpost>Cite journal|title= Japan - Education Videoconferencing Network Opens |publisher= Washington Post Newsweek Interactive via Newsbytes Network|date= June 29, 2000</ref> In 2002, foreign language instruction in Japan was a 670 billion yen industry, of which the five largest chains (Nova (eikaiwa)|Nova, GEOS (eikaiwa)|GEOS, ECC (eikaiwa)|ECC, Aeon (eikaiwa)|Aeon, and Berlitz Language Schools|Berlitz) accounted for 25%.<ref name="insatiable">cite web

Average salaries for eikawa teachers have generally fallen since the 1980s.  Eikawa teachers' unions have attempted to combat the decline in pay and benefits, with mixed results.<ref>Budmar, Patrick, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20120703zg.html The curious case of the eroding eikaiwa salary]", ''Japan Times'', 3 July 2012, p. 12</ref>

Staff
''Eikaiwa'' teachers are generally native English speakers from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, or New Zealand. According to ''The Japan Times'', the Justice Ministry estimates that some 90 percent of foreign residents in Japan stay for three years or less. For eikaiwa teachers, however, that figure rises to between 96 and 97 percent.<ref name=japantimesprobe>cite web |url= http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20050412zg.html|title= English schools face huge insurance probe|accessdate=2007-03-20 |publisher= The Japan Times|date= April 12, 2005 </ref>

In 2014, Eikaiwa chain Gaba, famous for its "man-to-man" (one-to-one) lessons, came under fire from local print media for its handling of sexual harassment complaints against students. In the absence of a grievance procedure, the Gaba branch of the General Union had to resort to collective bargaining to resolve at least one dispute.<ref>"Harassers exploit Gaba's man-to-man lesson format", The Japan Times, Jun 16 2014 [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/06/16/issues/harassers-exploit-gabas-man-man-lesson-format/#.VT66cGKSwvw]</ref>
