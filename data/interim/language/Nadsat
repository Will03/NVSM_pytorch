Nadsat is a fictional register (sociolinguistics)|register or argot used by the teenagers in Anthony Burgess's novel ''A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange''. In addition to being a novelist, Burgess was a linguistics|linguist<ref>Anthony Burgess, ''Language Made Plain'' and ''A Mouthful of Air''.</ref> and he used this background to depict his characters as speaking a form of Russian language|Russian-influenced English. The name itself comes from the Russian language|Russian suffix equivalent of "-teen" as in "thirteen" (-надцать, ''-nad&middot;tsat&apos;''). Nadsat was also used in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (film)|film adaptation of the book.

 Description 
Original research|section|date=May 2013
Nadsat is a mode of speech used by the ''nadsat'', members of the Youth subculture|teen subculture in the novel ''A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange''. The antihero and narrator of the book, Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex, uses it in Grammatical person|first-person style to relate the story to the reader. He also uses it to communicate with other characters in the novel, such as his ''<abbr title="close friends">droogs</abbr>'', parents, victims, and any authority-figures with whom he comes in contact. As with many speakers of non-standard varieties of English, Alex is capable of speaking standard English when he wants to.  It is not a written language: the sense that readers get is of a transcription of vernacular speech.

Nadsat is basically English with some borrowed words from Russian language|Russian. It also contains influences from Rhyming slang|Cockney rhyming slang, the King James Bible, the German language, some words of unclear origin, and some that Burgess invented. The word ''nadsat'' is the suffix of Russian numerals from 11 to 19 (-надцать). The suffix is an almost exact linguistic parallel to the English '-teen,' and is derived from "на", meaning "on" and a shortened form of "десять", the number ten. "Droog" is Russian друг "close friend".<ref>Eric Partridge, ''et al.'', ''The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English''; Wiktionary wiktionary:друг#Noun|друг (Russian)</ref> Some of the words are also almost childish English such as ''eggiweg'' ("egg") and ''appy polly loggy'' ("apology"), as well as regular English slang ''sod'' and ''snuff it''. The word ''like'' and the expression ''the old'' are often used as Filler (linguistics)|fillers or discourse markers.

The original 1991 translation of Burgess' book into Russian solved the problem of how to illustrate the Nadsat words, by using transliteration|transliterated, slang English words in places where Burgess had used Russian ones (i.e. "droogs" became "фрэнды" (''frendy''). However, this solution was imperfect as it lacked the original abstractness.by whom?|date=November 2017 Borrowed English words with Russian inflection were widely used in Russian slang, especially among Russian hippies in 1970s-1980s, and since 1990s there are a lot of anglicisms in Russian when it comes to computers and programming. Future translations would simply use the original untranslated Nadsat terms.

 Function 
Burgess, a polyglotism|polyglot who loved language in all its forms, was aware that linguistic slang was of a constantly changing nature.<ref>"Yes, [Anthony] Burgess loved to scatter polyglot obscurities like potholes throughout his more than 50 novels and dozens of nonfiction works. He could leap gaily from Welsh to French to Malay to Yiddish in one breath." Henry Kisor, ''Chicago Sun-Times'' 24 August 1997.</ref> Burgess knew that if he used modes of speech that were contemporarily in use, the novel would very quickly become dated. His use of Nadsat was essentially pragmatic; he needed his narrator to have a unique voice that would remain ageless while reinforcing Alex's indifference to his society's norms, and to suggest that youth subculture existed independently of the rest of society. In ''A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange'', Alex's interrogators describe the source of his argot as "Subliminal stimuli|subliminal penetration".

 Russian influences 
Russian influences play the biggest role in Nadsat. Most of those Russian-influenced words are slightly anglicized loan-words, often maintaining the original Russian pronunciation.<ref name="textual intricacies">cite book |last=Oks |first=Marina |title=Textual intricacies: essays on structure and intertextuality in nineteenth and twentieth century fiction in English |year=2009 |publisher=Trier: Wiss. Verl. Trier |pages=37–56 |author2=Christiane Bimberg |chapter=The Rebus of "Nadsat," or, A Key To A Clockwork Orange </ref> One example is the Russian word ''Lyudi'', which is anglicized to ''lewdies'', meaning "people".<ref name="real horrorshow">cite journal |last=Jackson |first=Kevin |title=Real Horrorshow: A Short Lexicon Of Nadsat |journal=Sight and Sound |year=1999 |issue=9 |pages=24–27 </ref> Another Russian word is ''Bábushka'' which is anglicized to ''baboochka'', meaning "grandmother", "old woman".<ref name="real horrorshow"/> Some of the anglicised words are truncated, for example "pony" from ''ponimát’'', "to understand", or otherwise shortened, for example "veck" from ''čelovék'', "person", "man" (though the anglicized word "chelloveck" is also used in the book).

A further means of constructing Nadsat words is the employment of homophones (known as folk etymology). For example, one Nadsat term which may seem like an English composition, ''horrorshow'', actually stems from the Russian word for "good"; ''khorosho'', which sounds similar to ''horrorshow''.<ref name="real horrorshow"/><ref name="argot implications">cite journal |last=Evans |first=Robert O. |title=Nadsat: The Argot and its Implications in Anthony Burgess' 'A Clockwork Orange' |journal=Journal of Modern Literature |year=1971 |issue=1 |pages=406–410 </ref> In this same manner many of the Russian loan-words become an English–Russian hybrid, with Russian origins, but English spellings and pronunciations.<ref name="understanding Nadsat talk">cite book|last=Watts|first=Selnon|title=Understanding Nadsat Talk in Anthony Burgess' a Clockwork Orange |year=2007 </ref> A further example is the Russian word for "head", ''golová'', which sounds similar to ''Gulliver'' known from ''Gulliver’s Travels''. Consequently ''Gulliver'' becomes the Nadsat expression for the concept "head".<ref name="real horrorshow"/><ref name="argot implications"/>

However, many of Burgess' loan-words, such as ''devotchka'' ("girl") and ''droog'' ("friend") maintain both their relative spelling and meaning over the course of translation.<ref name="understanding Nadsat talk"/>

 Word derivation by common techniques 
In addition, Nadsat's English slang is constructed with common language-formation techniques. Some words are blended, others clipped or compounded.<ref name="textual intricacies"/> In Nadsat-language a "fit of laughter" becomes a ''guff'' (shortened version of ''guffawing''); a "skeleton key" becomes a ''polyclef'' ("many keys"); and the "state jail" is blended to the ''staja''. Many common English slang terms are simply shortened.  A ''cancer stick'' which is (or was) a common English-slang expression for a "cigarette" is shortened to a ''cancer''.<ref name="understanding Nadsat talk"/>

 Rhyming slang 
; ''Charlie'' = "Chaplain" : ''Chaplain'' and ''Chaplin'' (from Charlie Chaplin) are homophones. Using the principles of rhyming slang Burgess uses ''Charlie Chaplin'' as a synonym for "Chaplain" and shortens it to ''Charlie''.<ref name="clockwork slang">cite book |last=Arnott |first=Luke |title=The Slang of A Clockwork Orange |year=2009 |url=https://suite.io/luke-arnott/1wsx20r |accessdate=24 June 2015</ref>better source|date=May 2013
; ''Cutter'' = "money":<ref name="textual intricacies"/><ref name="argot implications"/> ''Cutter'' rhymes with ''bread and butter'', a willful alteration of ''bread and honey'' "money".
; ''Pretty polly'' = "money" : Another colloquial expression used to describe the concept "money" is ''lolly''. ''Lolly'' rhymes with ''pretty polly'', which is the name of an English folk song and in the world of ''A Clockwork Orange'' becomes a new expression for "money".<ref name="clockwork slang"/>better source|date=May 2013
;''Hound-and-horny'' = "corny"
;''Twenty to one'' = fun, i.e. gang violence in the context of the story
