File:Intercultural.JPG|thumb| alt=An American Woman Interacting Inter-Culturally in Yunnan Province, China.|A Cross-Cultural Interaction in Yunnan Province, ChinaIntercultural Relations, sometimes called Intercultural Studies, is a relatively new formal field of social science studies.  It is a practical, multi-field discipline designed to train its students to understand, communicate, and accomplish specific goals outside their own cultures.<ref>Elmhurst College.  "Intercultural Studies Program". http://public.elmhurst.edu/academics/1265647.html. 2012.</ref>  Intercultural Relations involves, at a fundamental level, learning how to see oneself and the world through the eyes of another.  It is a broad rather than deep discipline that seeks to prepare students for interaction with cultures both similar to their own (e.g. a separate socioeconomic group in one's own country) or very different from their own (e.g. an American businessman in a small Amazon tribal society).<ref>learn.org, "What is Intercultural Studies?". http://learn.org/articles/What_is_Intercultural_Studies.html. 2012.</ref> Some aspects of intercultural relations also include, their power and cultural identity with how the relationship should be upheld with other foreign countries. <ref>Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=1958f2db-5104-44c0-b100-f094303e61c8@sessionmgr4009&bdata=JmxvZ2luLmFzcCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU=#AN=102142218&db=ufh|title=CHANGES IN VALUE STRUCTURES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERCULTURAL COMMUNICATION IN MODERN SOCIETY.|last=Hes|first=Ales|date=April 2015|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-20</ref>

Nature
The study of intercultural relations incorporates many different academic disciplines.  As a field, it is most closely tied to anthropology and sociology, although a degree program in Intercultural Relations or Intercultural Studies may also include the study of history, research methods, urban studies, gender studies, public health, many various natural sciences, human development (biology)|human development, political science, psychology, religion, missiology, and linguistics or other language training.<ref>Martin, Judith. Nakayama, Thomas. "Experiencing Intercultural Communication". McGraw Hill. 2004.</ref>  Often, Intercultural programs are designed to translate these academic disciplines into a practical training curricula.  Graduate school|Graduate programs will also prepare students for academic research and publication.<ref>learn.org, "What is Intercultural Studies?". http://learn.org/articles/What_is_Intercultural_Studies.html. 2012.</ref> Especially in today's global and multicultural world, yes, students of Intercultural Relations can use their training in many fields both internationally and domestically, and often pursue careers in social work, law, community development, religious work, and urban development.<ref>The College Board.

History
The origins of the practical use of multi-field Intercultural Relations can be traced back to Christian missionaries seeking to relate the Christian gospel to other cultures in effective, ethical and culturally sensitive ways.<ref>Pierson, Paul.>"The Dynamics of Christian Mission: History Through a Missiogical Perspective." William Carey International University Press. 2009.</ref><ref>Erickson, Paul.  Murphy, Liam.  "A History of Anthropological Theory." Third Edition.  University of Toronto Press. 2008.</ref>   Many Intercultural Studies programs are offered at religious institutions as training for missionaries and religiously motivated international development workers, and therefore often include some training in theology and evangelism.<ref>Wheaton College. "Intercultural Studies and Missions>. http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Departments/INTR/INTR-Missions. 2011</ref>  However, in an increasingly globalized world, the broader discipline attracts persons from many backgrounds with many different career goals.<ref>Teather, D. (2004). The networking alliance: A mechanism for the internationalisation of higher education? Managing Education Matters, 7(2), 3.</ref>  Both bachelor's and master's degrees are offered in the discipline.
