A posthumous name is an honorary name given to royalty, nobles, and sometimes others, in East Asia after the person's death, and is used almost exclusively instead of one's personal name or other official titles during their life. The posthumous name is commonly used when naming royalty of Table of Chinese monarchs|China, List of Korean monarchs|Korea, List of Vietnamese monarchs|Vietnam, and emperors of Japan|Japan.

Posthumous names in China and Vietnam were also given to honor lifetime accomplishments of many people who did not have hereditary titles &ndash; for example, to successful courtiers.

A posthumous name should not be confused with the era name and temple name.

Use
The posthumous name consists of one or more adjectives inserted before the ruler's current title. As rulers from different states might share the same posthumous name, but rulers ''within'' a state would usually not repeat an already used name, the name of the state or domain is usually also given to avoid ambiguity. In Chinese the whole construct is therefore "[state][adjective][title]", which in English is typically translated as "[title][adjective] of [state]", such as King Wen of Zhou, Duke Mu of Qin, and King Cheng of Chu. The literal meaning of the adjective is normally not translated.

While the names of living Chinese can be just about any combination of characters, the posthumous name was chosen from a rather small pool of stock characters; the literal meaning of which eroded as a result.

 History 

=Origins=
Early mythological rulers such as Emperor Yao are considered to have posthumous names.<ref>''Yiwen Leiju'', vols. :zh:s:藝文類聚/卷014|014</ref> All rulers of Shang Dynasty are known only by their posthumous names, as their personal names were not recorded in classical texts.

Archaeological discoveries have shown that early kings of the Zhou dynasty, such as King Wen of Zhou|King Wen and King Wu of Zhou|King Wu, used "posthumous names" during their lifetime, but later they became chosen by successors after the ruler's death. As a result, final rulers of states and rulers seen as illegitimate (such as usurpers) often do not have posthumous names and are referred to by their personal names, e.g. Jian, King of Qi; Min, Marquis of Jin; and Chen Tuo.

The use of posthumous names was stopped in the Qin Dynasty, because Qin Shi Huang proclaimed that it is disrespectful for the descendants, or "later emperors" to judge their elders, or the "prior emperors" (先帝). The practice was revived in the Han Dynasty after the demise of Qin.

=Decline in use=
Posthumous names are the conventional way of referring to rulers from the Zhou dynasty to the Sui dynasty. In the Zhou dynasty the posthumous name was usually only one character, such as "Wen" (cultured) or "Wu" (martial). However, as time went on rulers began to add more and more characters to the posthumous names of their ancestors. By the time of the Emperor Gaozu of Tang|first emperor of Tang the length had grown to 7 characters, which was taxing to pronounce or write. Therefore, emperors from Tang on are commonly referred to by either their temple name (Tang through Yuan dynasties) or era name (Ming and Qing dynasties), both of which are always just two characters long and therefore easy to remember and use.

=Later developments=

Posthumous names commonly made tracing linear genealogies simpler and kept a blood line apparent. The rule was also followed by non-Han Chinese rulers of Sixteen Kingdoms, Silla, Japan, Kingdom of Nanzhao, Liao dynasty, Vietnam, Western Xia, Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty, Yuan dynasty and Qing dynasty. King names of Hồng Bàng dynasty and List of legendary monarchs of Korea#Mahan|Mahan also followed the rule but they are thought to be later work.

Some rulers, such as Wu Zetian, or rebel leaders also had similar style regnal names when they were alive.

Most monarchs inherited the throne and did not give bad posthumous names to the previous monarch. Some names were lengthened or changed by later monarchs. Emperor Aizong of Jin and Chongzhen Emperor had different names from different people. Qin Hui (Song dynasty)|Qin Hui, of the Song dynasty, had a good name, was given a bad one, and had the good name later restored.<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/xhfk/2010-08/11/c_12433570.htm 韩侂胄——《宋史》中的一缕冤魂]</ref> After the Song dynasty few received bad names.<ref>[http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc 從文臣諡號看明清諡法理論，宋秉仁] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930152451/http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc |date=2007-09-30 </ref> Bad monarchs of the Joseon dynasty did not receive posthumous names.

Emperors of China continued to receive posthumous names of increasing length as a matter of ritual long after the naming convention had been abandoned in casual speech and writing. The Guangxu Emperor, who died in 1908 and was the last emperor to receive a posthumous name, sports the impressive 21-character title of "Emperor Tongtian Chongyun Dazhong Zhizheng Jingwen Weiwu Renxiao Ruizhi Duanjian Kuanqin Jing of Qing".

Puyi, the last emperor of China, did not receive a posthumous name upon his death in 1967 since he died at the height of the Cultural Revolution, when such practices would have been thought feudal.

Use of posthumous names ceased in China with the Guangxu Emperor (d.1908), in Vietnam with the Khải Định|Khải Định Emperor (d.1925) and in Korea with the Sunjong of Korea|Yunghui Emperor (d.1926). However, in Korea unofficial posthumous names were given to Crown Prince Euimin and Gu, Prince Imperial Hoeun.

=Contemporary Japanese use=
Posthumous names are in use to this day in Japan. A deceased emperor is given a posthumous name, which beginning with Emperor Meiji (d.1912) is identical to his era name and therefore always two characters long. The most recently conferred posthumous name is that of Hirohito|Emperor Showa (d.1989).

A non-royal deceased person may be given a posthumous Dharma name|Buddhist name known as ''kaimyo'', but is in practice still referred to by the living name.

Guidelines

=Selection=
Posthumous names can be praises (褒字) or deprecations (貶字). There are more praises than deprecations, so posthumous names are also commonly called ''respectful names'' (尊號 zūn hào) in Chinese. Sima Qian's ''Records of the Grand Historian'' outlines extensively the rules behind choosing the names.<ref>明朱睦《易学识遗》辑古谥法十二家，曰《史记谥法解》，曰《周书谥法》，曰《蔡邕独断谥法》，曰《苏洵谥法》，曰《周公谥法》，曰《春秋谥法》，曰《广谥法》，曰《沈约谥法》，曰《贺琛谥法》，曰《扈蒙谥法》，曰《郑樵谥法》，曰《陈思谥法》</ref> Some of those guidelines:

* Praises
** Those having a persistent and reasonable governance (剛強直理) are called "Martial" (武 wǔ). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who sympathize with the people and recognize their needs (憫民會椅) are called "Civil" (文 wén). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who respect the talented and value righteousness (尊賢貴義) are called "Reverent" (恭 gòng).
** Those who are kind and benevolent in nature (溫柔賢善) are called "Benign" (懿 yì).
** Those who aid the people out of righteousness (由義而濟) are called "Admirable" (景 jǐng).
** Those who treat the people compassionately with a gentle quality (柔質慈民) are called "Compassionate" (惠 huì).
** Those who eliminate destructions and purge cruelty (除殘去虐) are called "Tang" (湯 tāng). Possibly named after the revered ruler Cheng Tang (成湯), the founder of the Shang Dynasty.
** Those who make the people feel satisfied with their policies (安民立政) are called "Constructive" (成 chéng). Again, possibly named after Cheng Tang.
** Those who are considerate and far-sighted (果慮果遠) are called "Brilliant" (明 míng).
** Those who preach their virtue and righteousness to the people (布德執義) are called "Majestic" (穆 mù).
** Those who are aggressive to expand their realm (辟土服遠) are called "Exploratory" (桓 huán).
** "Highly (respected)" (高 gāo) is particularly reserved for the founders of dynasties.
* Deprecations
** Those who lived short lives without much accomplishment (短折不成) are called "Passed Away Prematurely" (殤 shāng).
** Those who have a constant twinge of depression (mood)|depression (often due to political plights) during their governance (在國遭憂) are called "Pitiful" (愍 mǐn).
** Those who lose their spouses and pass away at their early age (蚤孤短折) are called "Lamentable" (哀 āi).
** Those who are obliged to make sacrifices to their ancestors (肆行勞祀) are called "Mournful" (悼 dào). 
<!---   ** Those who are () are called "" ( ). -->

However, most of these qualifications are subjective, repetitive, and highly stereotypical; hence the names are chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Such names are usually given by court historians, according to their good deeds or the bad ones.

When combining an emperor's temple name and posthumous name, the temple name is placed first. For example, the Shunzhi Emperor whose full posthumous name would be "Shi Zu - Zhang Huang Di" (世祖章皇帝), combining the last 2 characters of his temple name and the last 3 of his posthumous name, which is the form most commonly seen in old documents. A fuller description of this naming convention for royalty appears in the Chinese sovereign entry. The posthumous names of some monarchs and royal members were long, for example Hongwu Emperor, Nurhaci, :zh:朝鮮文祖|Crown Prince Hyomyeong, Sunjo of Joseon and Empress Dowager Cixi.

Some monarchs did not follow these guidelines. Some monarchs of Ju (state)|Ju, Chu (state)|Chu, and Qi (Henan)|Qi used place names. Some monarchs of Yue (state) had Chinese transliterated posthumous names. Some monarchs of Goguryeo, Silla and Baekje had different style posthumous names. Some early Japan monarchs also had Japanese-style posthumous names (和風諡号).

China

=Emperors and empresses=

All Chinese posthumous names for rulers end in one or two of the Chinese character|characters for "emperor of China|emperor", ''Huángdì'' (皇帝, i.e. emperor), which can be shortened to ''Dì''; except about a dozen or so less recognized ones who have had only ''Dì'' and no ''Huáng''.

Starting with Emperor Emperor Wen of Han|Xiaowen of Han (more commonly "Emperor Wen"), every single Han emperor, except the first one of the Eastern Han Dynasty, has the character of "filial piety|filial" (孝 xiào) at the beginning of his posthumous names. "Filial" is also used in the full posthumous names of virtually all emperors and empresses of the Tang Dynasty|Tang, Song Dynasty|Song, Ming Dynasty|Ming and Qing Dynasty|Qing Dynasties. For Qing emperors, 孝 xiào is placed in various position in the string of characters, while those Qing empresses who were given posthumous names, 孝 xiào is always initial.

The number of characters in posthumous names was increasing. The emperors of the Tang Dynasty have names in between seven and eighteen characters. Those in the Qing Dynasty have twenty-one characters. For instance, that of the Shunzhi Emperor was "The Emperor of Order who Observes the Heavenly Rituals with a Solemn Fate, Destined to Unify, Establishes with Extreme Talented Insights, Admires the Arts, Manifests the Might, with Great Virtue and Vast Achievement, Reaches Humanity, Purely Filial" (體天隆運定統建極英睿欽文顯武大德弘功至仁純孝章皇帝,  Audio|Chinese-Emperor Shunzhi posthumous name.ogg|Listen to pronunciation: tǐ tiān lóng yùn dìng tǒng jiàn jí yīng ruì qīn wén xiǎn wǔ dà dé hóng gōng zhì rén chún xiào zhāng huáng dì).

The woman with the longest posthumous name is Empress Dowager Cixi, who is "The Empress who is Admirably Filial, Initiates Kindness, with Blessed Health, Manifests Much Contentment, Solemn Sincerity, with Longevity, Provides Admiration Prosperously, Reveal Adoration, Prosperous with a Merry Heaven, with a Holy Appearance" (孝欽慈禧端佑康頤昭豫莊誠壽恭欽獻崇熙配天興聖顯皇后 xiào qīn cí xǐ duān yòu kāng yí zhāo yù zhuāng chéng shòu gōng qīn xiàn chóng xī pèi tiān xīng shèng xiǎn huáng hòu), or 孝欽顯皇后 for short.

=Imperial family=

According to the noble system since the Zhou Dynasty, the immediate family members of the Emperor were given the titles of Kings (or Princes), Dukes, Earls, etc., with or without actual control over a region of land. After their death, they would be referred to by the same title, with the posthumous name (usually one character) inserted in the middle. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. For example, Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong of the Qing Dynasty was posthumously named Zhong (忠), and thus is referred to as Prince Gongzhong (恭忠親王 Gongzhong qīnwáng); Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun was posthumous named Xian (賢), hence is referred Prince Chunxian (醇賢親王 Chunxian qīnwáng).

=Officials=
It was also common for persons with no hereditary titles, especially accomplished scholar-officials or ministers, to be given posthumous names by the imperial court. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. The length, however, was restricted to one or two characters. The posthumous name is sometimes rendered canonization in English, for the scholar-official to Confucianism is analogous to the saint in the Catholic Church, though the process is not nearly as long. See List of Posthumous Names for some examples.

Confucius has been given long posthumous names in almost every major dynasty. One of the most commonly used was Zhìshèngxiānshī 至聖先師.

Sometimes a person is given a posthumous name not by the court, but by his own family or disciples. Such names are private posthumous names (Sĩshì, 私諡). For example, Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian was given ''Sishi'' Jìngjié 靖節.

Korea
In Korea, Goguryeo kings were mostly given posthumous names after their burial places, or in case of Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo|Gwanggaeto, the name described his life.<ref>cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3006407|title=Of tombs and posthumous names|date=2015-07-09|accessdate=2016-06-03|publisher=Korea JoongAng Daily</ref> In Silla, every monarchs were given the titles of ''wang'' (왕, 王, "king") with two characters in posthumous names from Jijeung of Silla. On the other hand, all posthumous names for kings of Balhae were restricted to one character.

Most of the kings of Goryeo and Joseon were called temple name more than posthumous name unlike dynasties of ancient Korea. All posthumous names for rulers of Goryeo and Joseon end in two of the characters for ''Daewang'' (대왕, 大王, "great king"). This is a longer name, made up of adjectives characteristic of the king's rule.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/common/printpreview.asp?categoryCode=628&newsIdx=153615|title=Rediscovering aesthetics of Jongmyo Shrine |publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=2015-12-09</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/korea/01_notes.php|title=Korea: Notes|publisher=archontology.org|accessdate=2015-12-09</ref><ref>cite journal|url=http://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000927530|title=조선시대 국왕호칭의 종류와 의미  The Kinds and Meaning of King's Name in the Chosun Dynasty|publisher=NRF|journal=역사와경계 |year=2004|issue=52|pages=46–67|language=English, Korean|accessdate=2015-12-09</ref> For example, Gwangjong of Goryeo's posthumous name was ''Hongdoseon Yeolpyeongse Sukheonui Hyoganghye Daeseong Daewang'' (홍도선열평세숙헌의효강혜대성대왕, 弘道宣烈平世肅憲懿孝康惠大成大王), while his temple name was ''Gwangjong''. Details of the system of posthumous name were made during the Joseon Dynasty. The deposed king's names were made up of three parts: the temple name (묘호), eulogistic names (존호) and  posthumous names (시호). During the Joseon Dynasty, After five days the king's funeral, officials discussed and decided the king's posthumous name. The deceased king, who before his temple and posthumous names was decided, was called ''Daehaeng daewang'' (대행대왕, 大行大王). The Ministry of Culture and Education (예조, 禮曹) was in charge of the naming. When officials of the ministry of culture and education selected three candidates and reported them to the next king, the next king chose the one of those names that he liked best. Also, Shorn of his power, the deposed king has not been given any posthumous names with temple name unless reinstated. They were degraded to the rank of ''gun'' (군, 君, "prince"). Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsan-gun and Gwanghaegun of Joseon|Gwanghae-gun were are notable examples. And there are some men who they didn't ascend the throne in their lifetime, but proclaimed as kings after they died by the their descendants who became king. There are nine men who proclaimed as kings in the Joseon Dynasty. In Joseon, there are nine men who raised to the status of the emeritus kings.

Gojong of Joseon proclaimed Korea an empire in 1897, receiving the title of emperor, thus the posthumous names of Gojong and Sunjong of Korea|Sunjong end in two of the characters for ''Hwangje'' (황제, 皇帝, "emperor"). For example, full posthumous name of Emperor Gojong of Korea is ''Tongcheonyung-un Jogeukdonyun Jeongseonggwang-ui Myeonggongdaedeok Yojunsunhwi Umotanggyeong Eungmyeongripgi Jihwasinryeol Oehunhong-eop Gyegiseonryeok Geonhaenggonjeong Yeong-uihonghyu Sugangmunheon Mujanginik Jeonghyo Taehwangje'' (통천융운조극돈윤정성광의명공대덕요준순휘우모탕경응명립기지화신렬외훈홍업계기선력건행곤정영의홍휴수강문헌무장인익정효태황제, 統天隆運 肇極敦倫 正聖光義 明功大德 堯峻舜徽 禹謨湯敬 應命立紀 至化神烈 巍勳洪業 啓基宣曆 乾行坤定 英毅弘休 壽康文憲 武章仁翼 貞孝太皇帝), or ''Taehwangje'' for short.

Crown Prince Hyomyeong has been given the longest posthumous name in Korea. He was posthumously elevated in status and given the title Emperor Munjo with 117 characters in posthumous names in 1899.

Japan
In Japan, posthumous names are called ''shigō'' (諡号), ''okuri-na'' (諡), or ''tsuigo'' (追号). Those of Japanese emperors are also sometimes called ''teigō'' (帝号, "emperor name[s]").

There are two styles in emperors' posthumous names, namely Chinese style and Japanese style. In addition to the appellation ''Tennō'' (天皇, "heavenly sovereign", usually translated as ''Emperor'') that is a part of all Japanese emperors' posthumous name, most of them consist of two kanji characters, although a few consist of three. Some names are given several generations later—this is the case for Emperor Jimmu and Emperor Antoku, for example. Others are given immediately after death, like that of Emperor Monmu.

Many have Chinese-style names, for example:
* Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇 ''Jinmu Tennō'', lit. ''Divine Might'')
* Emperor Nintoku (仁徳天皇 ''Nintoku Tennō'', lit. ''Humane  Virtue'')
* Emperor Ōjin (応神天皇 ''Ōjin Tennō'', lit. ''Answering the Gods'')

Some have Japanese-style names. For example:
* those who were named after the place where the emperor was born, lived or frequented:
** Emperor Saga (嵯峨天皇 ''Saga Tennō''), named after a palace (院 ''in'')
** Emperor Ichijo|Emperor Ichijō (一条天皇 ''Ichijō Tennō''), named after an official residence (邸 ''tei'')
** Emperor Kōmyō (光明天皇 ''Kōmyō Tennō''), named after a temple
** Emperor Higashiyama (東山天皇 ''Higashiyama Tennō''), named after a hill
* those who were named after an emperor whose admirable characteristics resemble those of an earlier one by adding ''Go'' (後, lit. ''latter'') as a prefix to the earlier emperor's name:
** Emperor Go-Ichijo|Emperor Go-Ichijō  (後一条天皇 ''Go-Ichijō Tennō'')
** Emperor Go-Daigo (後醍醐天皇 ''Go-Daigo Tennō'')
** Empress Go-Sakuramachi (後桜町天皇 ''Go-Sakuramachi Tennō'')
* those who were named by combining the characters from two previous emperors' names:
** Empress Genmei|Empress Genmei (元明天皇 ''Genmei Tennō'') + Empress Genshō|Empress Genshō (元正天皇 ''Genshō Tennō'') = Empress Meishō|Empress Meishō (明正天皇 ''Meishō Tennō'')
** Empress Kōken|Empress Shōtoku (称徳天皇 ''Shōtoku Tennō'') + Emperor Kōnin|Emperor Kōnin (光仁天皇 ''Kōnin Tennō'') = Emperor Shōkō|Emperor Shōkō (称光天皇 ''Shōkō Tennō'')

Since the death of Emperor Meiji (明治天皇 ''Meiji Tennō'') in 1912, the posthumous name of an emperor has always been the name of his Japanese era name|era.  For example, after his death, Hirohito (by which he is usually called outside Japan) was formally renamed Emperor Shōwa (昭和天皇 ''Shōwa Tennō'') after Shōwa period|his era; Japanese now refer to him by only that name. ''Hirohito'' was his given name; most Japanese never refer to their emperors by their given names, Naming taboo#In other countries|as it is considered disrespectful.
