The first published use of the word according to the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1967.<ref name="OED">cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/245968 |title=mockney, n. and adj.|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=23 June 2014</ref>

It is an affectation sometimes adopted for aesthetic or theatrical purposes, and at other times just to sound "cool", to generate street credibility, or to give the false impression that the speaker rose from humble beginnings and became prominent through some innate talent rather than the education, contacts and other advantages that a privileged background tends to bring.

One explanation of dialect adoption given in social linguistics is the desire for Prestige dialect|prestige, that a person is likely to adopt speech patterns (including accent, vocabulary, dialect or even language) which they perceive to be prestigious.

The concept of Communication Accommodation Theory|communication accommodation, either upwards or downwards in idiolect, can be seen in many social interactions. One can put someone at ease by speaking in a familiar tone or intonation, or one can intimidate or alienate someone by speaking more formally. For example, in a courtroom, a more formal voice Register (sociolinguistics)|register with technical legal jargon can be used to intimidate a defendant. In contrast, mockney seeks to lower the perceived socio-economic class of the speaker.
