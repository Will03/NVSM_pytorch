Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language (ABSL) is a village sign language used by about 150 deaf and many hearing members of the al-Sayyid, Israel|al-Sayyid Bedouin tribe in the Negev|Negev desert of southern Israel.

As deafness is so frequent (4% of the population is deaf, compared to 0.1% in the United States)<ref name=TalkingHands>cite book|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Talking Hands|year=2008|publisher=Simon & Schuster Paperbacks|location=New York, New York</ref> and deaf and hearing people share a language, deaf people are not stigmatised in this community, and marriage between deaf and hearing people is common. There is also no separate Deaf culture or politics.<ref name="TalkingHands"/>

History
In 2004, the Al-Sayyid community numbered around 3,000, most of whom trace their ancestry to the time the village was founded, in the mid-19th century, by a local woman and an Egyptian man. Two of this founding couple's five sons carried a gene for nonsyndromic, genetically recessive, profound pre-lingual neurosensory deafness. The descendants of the founding couple often Cousin marriage|married their cousins due to the tribe's rejection by its neighbours for being "foreign fellahin".<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=434665 One in Twenty] Haaretz, 2 June 2004</ref> The gene became homozygous in several members of the family.

ABSL was first studied in the late 1990s by anthropologist Shifra Kisch<ref>Kisch, Shifra. 2000. ‘Deaf discourse’: Social construction of deafness in a Bedouin community in the Negev. MA thesis, Tel Aviv University.</ref> and came to worldwide attention in February 2005 when an international group of researchers published a study of the language in the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences''.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/102/7/2661.full The emergence of grammar: Systematic structure in a new language], Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Wendy Sandler, Irit Meir, Carol Padden, and Mark Aronoff</ref> The spontaneous emergence of the language in the last 70 years, which has developed a complex grammar in near-isolation, is of particular interest to linguistics|linguists for the insights it provides into the birth of human language.

Linguistics
Scholars study ABSL because it is the closest they can come to performing the "forbidden experiment" (a type of language deprivation experiment in which children are isolated before they are exposed to any language so that experimenters may observe their organic formation of a language). Since deaf people in Al-Sayyid cannot hear Arabic or Hebrew and they have not been exposed to any other sign languages, ABSL is a brand new language, uninfluenced by any other.what|date=February 2015 ABSL is in its early stages, so researchers are observing the language as it develops.<ref name="TalkingHands"/>

ABSL shows a preference for subject–object–verb word order (e.g., "woman child feed"), in marked contrast to the dialect of Arabic language|Arabic spoken by hearing members of the community (subject–verb–object|SVO), as well as Hebrew language|Hebrew (subject–verb–object|SVO), classical Arabic (verb–subject–object|VSO), and the predominant sign languages in the region, Israeli Sign Language and Jordanian Sign Language. The authors of the study (Mark Aronoff from State University of New York at Stony Brook, Irit Meir and Wendy Sandler from the University of Haifa and Carol Padden from the University of California, San Diego) see ABSL as evidence for the human tendency to construct communication along grammar|grammatical lines. These authors remarked on the speed with which a grammar emerged, with the SOV word-order emerging with the first generation of signers, as well as the language's continuing rapid development – the third generation is signing twice as fast as the first and is using longer sentences.

Researchers have detected examples of abstraction in the language, a sure sign of grammatical development. For example, the sign for "man" is formed by the curling of the finger in the shape of a mustache, although Bedouin men no longer wear mustaches.<ref name=NYT>cite news|last=Wade|first=Nicholas |title=A New Language Arises, and Scientists Watch It Evolve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/01/science/01lang.html|accessdate=2012-11-11|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 1, 2005</ref> However, the language does not currently contain "agreeing" verbs, as most known sign languages do, which may indicate that the language has more grammatical development in store.<ref name="TalkingHands"/>

The community was isolated not by geography but by social stigma,<ref name="NYT"/> on several levels. Contact with the outside world is growing, as students are exposed to Israeli Sign Language and Jordanian Sign Language in schools, and community members are marrying outside the community.
