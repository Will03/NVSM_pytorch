In linguistics, heterography is a property of a written language, such that it lacks a Bijection|1-to-1 correspondence between the written symbols and the sounds of the spoken language.<ref name=Trask1>cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology|article=heterography|author=Robert Lawrence Trask|pages=170|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=9780415112611|authorlink=Larry Trask</ref>Dubious|date=March 2010 Its opposite is homography, which is the property of a language such that written symbols of its written form and the sounds of its spoken form have a 1-to-1 correspondence.<ref name=Trask2>cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology|article=homography|author=Robert Lawrence Trask|pages=172|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=9780415112611|authorlink=Larry Trask</ref>Dubious|date=March 2010

The English orthography|orthography of the English language is, according to Larry Trask, a "spectacular example" of heterography.  But most European languages exhibit it to some extent. Finnish language|Finnish is "very close" to being a systematically homographic language.<ref name=Trask1 /><ref name=Trask2 />  A phonemic transcription (such as a transcription of phonemes that uses the International Phonetic Alphabet, for example) is, by its nature, homographic, also.<ref name=Trask2 />

The degree of heterography of a language is a factor in how difficult it is for person to learn to read that language, with highly heterographic orthographies being more difficult to learn than more homographic ones.  Many people have espoused the point of view that the extreme heterographic nature of English is a disadvantage in several respects.  These include, for example, Dr. Kiyoshi Makita writing in the July 1968 issue of the ''American Journal of Orthopsychiatry'', who attributes the rarity of dyslexia amongst Japanese children to the fact that Japanese language|Japanese is highly homographic language.<ref>cite book|title=Concept and Methods of Special Education|author=Vijay Pratap Singh|chapter=The Poor Speller and Reader|pages=261|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=81-7625-450-9|year=2004</ref>

Confusion between heterographic homophone|homophonic words (homophonic heterographs or heterographic homophones) such as "wikt:piece#English|piece" and "wikt:peace#English|peace" is one of the symptoms of surface dyslexia, a form of dyslexia causing error when a word's spelling is not perceived to be in accord with pronunciation rules.<ref>cite book|title=Communication Disorders in Spanish Speakers|editor1=José G. Centeno |editor2=Raquel Teresa Anderson |editor3=Loraine K. Obler |pages=235|chapter=Description and Detection of Acquired Dyslexia and Disgraphia in Spanish|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2007|isbn=9781853599712|author=J. Carolina Iribarren</ref>

Other homophonic heterographs in English include:

* "wikt:I#English|I", "wikt:aye#English|aye", and "wikt:eye#English|eye";
* "wikt:right#English|right", "wikt:rite#English|rite", "wikt:wright#English|wright", and "wikt:write#English|write";
* "wikt:read#English|read" and "wikt:reed#English|reed"; and
* "wikt:there#English|there", "wikt:their#English|their", and "wikt:they#English|they're".<ref name=StainthorpHughes />

In French, examples include "wikt:sain#French|sain" and "wikt:saint#French|saint".<ref>cite book|title=Handbook of Orthography and Literacy|editor1=R. Malatesha Joshi |editor2=P. G. Aaron |chapter=Orthography and literacy in French|pages=85|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9780805854671|author=Jean-Pierre Jaffr&eacute; and Michel Fayol</ref>

Heterographs are especially problematic for written communication, in that spelling errors (e.g., in a word-processed or emailed document) due to the typist choosing the wrong member of a heterograph set will persist into the final document, even after spell-checking. This is because heterographs cannot be caught by a simple spell checker, which only inspects the word itself (i.e., which is correct in some contexts) and not the context it is in (which may indicate the need for a different spelling).

Heterophonic homographs (also known as homographic heterophones) are, in contrast, words whose spoken sounds differ but whose written forms are the same.  English has a few hundred heterophonic homographs,<ref name=Higgins>cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/wordscape/wordlist/graph.html |title=Homographs |author=John Higgins |accessdate=2009-12-01</ref> examples of these latter include "wikt:lead#English|lead" ("lead by example" vs "lead poisoning") and "wikt:read#English|read" ("will read" vs "has read").<ref name=StainthorpHughes>cite book|title=Learning from Children who Read at an Early Age|author1=Rhona Stainthorp  |author2=Diana Hughes |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=9|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1999|isbn=9780415174954</ref><ref name=Higgins/>

The two aforementioned classes of words, along with a third class (homophonic homographs&mdash;words with different meanings whose written and spoken forms are both the same, such as "wikt:bank#English|bank" in English and "wikt:杜鹃|杜鹃" in Chinese) are the three classes of lexical ambiguities in all languages (marked in green in the key on the right).<ref name=Li>cite book|title=The handbook of East Asian psycholinguistics|author=Ping Li|pages=273|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780521833332</ref> "Heterophonic heterographs" (marked in brown) are words spelled differently and pronounced differently, consisting of all words outside of the other three classes.

In other languages
=Chinese=
Chinese language|Chinese has many words that are both homophonic and homotonic.  Distinctions are made between such words using heterography.<ref name=Yip>cite book|title=The Chinese Lexicon|author=Po-ching Yip|pages=16|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=9780415151740</ref>  Homophonic heterographs are very frequent in Chinese, whereas heterophonic homographs are not.<ref name=Li />  In contrast, homographic heterophony is one of the most salient characteristics of English orthography, with the "-ough" in "wikt:though#English|though", "wikt:tough#English|tough", "wikt:through#English|through", "wikt:thought#English|thought", "bough", "cough", and "dough"  being homographic but greatly heterophonic.<ref name=ChangeuxChavaillon>cite book|title=Origins of the Human Brain|author1=Jean-Pierre Changeux  |author2=Jean Chavaillon |lastauthoramp=yes |page=225|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780198523901</ref>

=French=
Although the French language has homographic heterophony (as in the ''-ars'' ending of ''wikt:Mars#French|Mars'', ''wikt:jars#French|jars'', and ''wikt:gars#French|gars''), perhaps its most prominent irregularity is its heterographic homophony. Speakers of some regional dialectswhich|date=June 2017 pronounce the following word endings identically: ''-eng'' (as in ''wikt:hareng#French|hareng''), ''-empt'', ''-amp'', and ''-ans'', ''wikt:champ#French|champ'', ''wikt:exempt#French|exempt'', ''wikt:dans#French|dans''.<ref name=ChangeuxChavaillon />
