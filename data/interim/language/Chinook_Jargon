Chinook Jargon (also known as lang|chn|Chinuk Wawa, or lang|chn|Chinook Wawa) is a nearly extinct American indigenous language originating as a pidgin language|pidgin trade language in the Pacific Northwest, and spreading during the 19th century from the lower Columbia River, first to other areas in modern Oregon and Washington (state)|Washington, then British Columbia and as far as Alaska and Yukon Territory, sometimes taking on characteristics of a creole language.<ref name=lang>Cite book  | last = Lang  | first = George  | title = Making Wawa: The Genesis of Chinook Jargon  | publisher = UBC Press  | year = 2008 | location = Vancouver | pages = especially 127–128 | isbn = 978-0-7748-1526-0 </ref> It is partly descended from the Chinook language, upon which much of its vocabulary is based.<ref name=dene>cite web |url=http://www.ydli.org/bcother/chinook.htm |title=Chinook Jargon |accessdate=2009-12-02 |publisher=Yinka Dene Language Institute</ref>

Many words from Chinook Jargon remain in common use in the Western United States, British Columbia and the Yukon Territory|Yukon, in indigenous languages as well as regional English usage.<ref name=dillard>Dillard, Joey Lee. 1985.

Though existent in Chinook Jargon, the consonant IPA|/r/ is rare, and English and French loan words, such as ''rice'' and lang|fr|merci, have changed in their adoption to the Jargon, to lang|chn|lice and lang|chn|mahsie, respectively.

Overview and history

The Jargon was originally constructed from a great variety of Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian words of the Pacific Northwest, arising as an intra-indigenous contact language in a region marked by divisive geography and intense linguistic diversity. The participating peoples came from a number of very distinct language family|language families, speaking dozens of individual languages.<ref name=holton>Holton, Jim. 1999. Chinook Jargon: The Hidden Language of the Pacific Northwest.</ref> It peaked in usage from approximately 1858 to 1900, and declined as a result of the Spanish Flu, World War I and Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools.<ref name="The Tyee">cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/Life/2006/01/10/StillSpeakChinook/|title=Can We Still Speak Chinook? - The Tyee|date=10 January 2006|work=The Tyee</ref>

After European contact, the Jargon also acquired English language|English and French language|French loans, as well as words brought by other Indo-European languages|EuropeanCitation needed|date=April 2008, Languages of Asia|AsianCitation needed|date=April 2008, and Polynesian languages|PolynesianCitation needed|date=April 2008 groups. Some individuals from all these groups soon adopted The Jargon as a highly efficient and accessible form of communication. This use continued in some business sectors well into the 20th century<ref>''Early Vancouver'', Maj. J.S. "Skit" Matthews, City of Vancouver, 1936.</ref><ref name=lillard>Cite book  | last = Lillard | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Lillard |author2=Terry Glavin  | title = A Voice Great Within Us  | publisher = New Star Books  | year = 1998 | location = Vancouver | isbn = 0-921586-56-6 </ref> and some of its words continue to feature in company and organization names as well as in the List of Chinook Jargon placenames|regional toponymy.

In the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kamloops|Diocese of Kamloops, British Columbia, hundreds of speakers also learned to read and write the Jargon using Duployan shorthand via the publication ''Kamloops Wawa''<!--Fr Lejeune shlud be mentioned-->.  As a result, the Jargon also had the beginnings of its own literature, mostly translated Bible|scripture and Classics|classical works, and some local and Bishop (Catholic Church)#Diocesan bishops or eparchs|episcopal news, community gossip and events, and Personal journal|diaries.<ref name=holton /> Novelist and early Native American activist Marah Ellis Ryan (c. 1860-1934) used Chinook words and phrases in her writing.<ref>''Squaw Elouise'', Chicago; New York: Rand, McNally, 1892; ''Told in the Hills'', Chicago; New York: Rand, McNally, 1891, 1905.</ref>

In Oregon, Chinook Jargon was widely used by Natives, trappers, traders, employees of the Hudson's Bay Company, missionaries, and pioneers who came across the Oregon Trail from the 1830s-1870s. In Portland, Oregon|Portland's first half century (1840s-1890s) there were frequent trade interactions between pioneers and Native Americans. After about 1900, when such daily interactions were less frequent, Jargon was spoken among pioneer families to prove how early they arrived out west. Many Oregonians used Jargon in casual conversation—to add humor, whimsy or emphasis and to exhibit deep knowledge of Oregon's history. Though traditions of speaking Jargon faded away among the non-Native population, some of Oregon's tribal groups continued speaking Chinook Jargon, though usage was diminished. However, a strong revival occurred with the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon's 2012 "Chinuk Wawa" dictionary.<ref name=prince>cite news

According to Nard Jones, Chinook Jargon was still in use in Seattle until roughly the eve of World War II, especially among the members of the Arctic Club (Seattle)|Arctic Club, making Seattle the last city where the language was widely used. Writing in 1972, he remarked that at that later date "Only a few can speak it fully, men of ninety or a hundred years old, like Henry Broderick (Seattle)|Henry Broderick, the realtor, and Joshua Green (seaman and banker)|Joshua Green, the banker."<ref>Cite book

Name
Most books written in English still use the term Chinook Jargon, but some linguists working with the preservation of a creolized form of the language used in Grand Ronde, Oregon prefer the term ''Chinuk Wawa'' (with the spelling 'Chinuk' instead of 'Chinook'). Historical speakers did not use the name ''Chinook Wawa'', however, but rather ''"the Wawa"'' or ''"Lelang"'' (from Fr. ''la langue'', the language, or tongue).Citation needed|date=December 2013  NB ''Wawa'' also means speech or words &ndash; "have a wawa" means "hold a parley" even in idiomatic English today,<ref name="lillard"/><!--I'm from the Pacific Northwest, and no one who I have spoken to recognizes that phrase.--><!--cite available for that usage is from Begbie's/Bushby's field notes c.1859-60, don't have 'em here--> and ''lelang'' also means the physical bodypart, the tongue.<ref name="chinuk wawa dictionary project">Cite book |author=Chinuk Wawa Dictionary Project |title= Chinuk Wawa / kakwa nsayka ulman-tili̩xam ɬaska munk-kəmtəks nsayka / as Our Elders Teach Us to Speak it |publisher= University of Washington Press |year= 2012 |isbn= 0295991860 </ref>

The name for the Jargon varied throughout the territory in which it was used. For example: ''skokum hiyu'' in the Boston Bar, British Columbia|Boston Bar-Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton area of the Fraser Canyon, or in many areas simply just "the old trade language" or "the Hudson Bay language".<!--I'll try and get cite backup for that; it's first person reportage from Siska BC--><!--This is what I've heard it called in Klemtu and Bella Coola -->

Origins and evolution
More citations needed|date=August 2008
There is some controversy about the origin of the Jargon, but all agree that its glory days were during the 19th century. During this era many dictionaries were published to help settlers interact with the First Nations people living there. The old settler families' heirs in the Pacific Northwest sent communiques to each other, stylishly composed entirely in "the Chinook". Many residents of the British Columbia city of Vancouver spoke Chinook Jargon as their first language, even using it at home in preference to English. Among the first Europeans to use Chinook Jargon were Merchant|traders, animal trapping|trappers, Voyageurs, Coureur des bois|Coureurs des bois and Catholic missionaries.<ref> Goulet, George and Terry Goulet. http://www.metismuseum.ca/media/document.php/149202.Chinook%20Jargon.pdf</ref> <ref>Barkwell, Lawrence. https://www.scribd.com/document/142973621/Chinook-Metis-Trade-Language</ref>

Hawaiians and American in the region made much use of it as well. In some places Kanakas married into the First Nations and non-native families and their particular mode of the Jargon is believed to have contained Hawaiian words, or Hawaiian styles of pronunciation. Similarly the Jargon as spoken by a Chinese person or a Norwegian or a Scot will have been influenced by those individuals' native-speaker terms and accents. In some areas the adoption of further non-aboriginal words has been observed. The Chinook Jargon naturally became the first language in multi-racial households and in multi-ethnic work environments such as canneries and lumberyards and ranches where it remained the language of the workplace well into the middle of the 20th century. During the Gold Rush, Chinook Jargon was used in British Columbia by gold prospectors and Royal Engineers, Columbia detatchment|Royal Engineers. As industry developed, Chinook Jargon was often used by cannery workers and hop pickers of diverse ethnic background. Loggers, fishermen and ranchers incorporated it in their jargon.

A heavily creolized form of Chinook Jargon (Chinuk Wawa) is still spoken as a first language by some residents of Oregon, much as the Métis people (Canada)|Métis language Michif is spoken in Canada. Hence, Chinuk Wawa as it is known in Oregon is now a creole language, distinct from the widespread and widely varied pronunciation of the Chinook Jargon as it spread beyond the Chinookan homeland. There is evidence that in some communities (e.g., around Fort Vancouver) the Jargon had become creolized by the early 19th century and that would have been among the mixed French/Métis, Algonkian, Scots and Hawaiian population there as well as among the natives around the Fort. At Grand Ronde, the resettlement of tribes from all over Oregon in a multi-tribal agency led to the use of Chinuk Wawa as a common tongue among the linguistically diverse population. These circumstances led to the creolization of Chinuk Wawa at Grand Ronde.<ref name=zenk>Cite book | last = Zenk | first = Henry | authorlink = Henry Benjamin Zenk | title = Chinook Jargon and Native Cultural Persistence in the Grand Ronde Indian Community, 1856-1907: A Special Case of Creolization | publisher = University of Oregon | year = 1984 </ref> There is also evidence that creolization occurred at the Confederated Tribes of Siletz reservation paralleling Grand Ronde<ref>cite web|url=http://www.livingtongues.org/hotspots/hotspot.siletz.html|title=Siletz Dee-Ni Talking Online Dictionary Project Western North America -  Living Tongues Institute For Endangered Languages|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110013331/http://www.livingtongues.org/hotspots/hotspot.siletz.html|archivedate=2013-11-10|df=</ref> although, due to language revitalization efforts being focused on the Tolowa language, Chinuk fell out of use.

No studies of British Columbia versions of the Jargon have demonstrated creolization. The range of varying usages and vocabulary in different regions suggests that localization did occur — although not on the pattern of Grand Ronde where Wasco, Klickitat and other peoples adopted and added to the version of the Jargon that developed there. First-language speakers of the Chinook Jargon were common in BC (native and non-native), until the mid-20th century. It is a truism that while after 1850 the Wawa was mostly a native language in the United States portion of the Chinook-speaking world, it remained in wide use among non-natives north of the border for another century, especially in wilderness areas and work environments.<ref name="lillard"/> Local creolizations probably did occur in British Columbia, but recorded materials have not been studied as they were made due to the focus on the traditional aboriginal languages.Citation needed|date=August 2008

Manywho|date=November 2012 believe that something similar to the Jargon existed before European contact — without European words in its vocabulary.<ref>Thomas, Edward Harper.

ISBN|0-8323-0217-1.</ref> There is some evidence for a Chinookan-Nuu-chah-nulth lingua franca in the writings of John Jewitt and in what is known as the Barclay Sound word-list, from the area of Ucluelet and Port Alberni|Alberni.

Current scholarly opinionwho|date=November 2012 holds that a trade language probably existed before European contact, which began "morphing" into the more familiar Chinook Jargon in the late 1790s, notably at a dinner party at Nootka Sound where Capts George Vancouver|Vancouver and Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra|Bodega y Quadra were entertained by Chief Maquinna and his brother Callicum performing a theatrical using mock English and mock Spanish words and mimicry of European dress and mannerisms. There evidently was a Jargon in use in the Queen Charlotte, but this "Haida language|Haida Jargon" is not known to have shared anything in common with Chinook Jargon, or with the Nooktan-Chinookan "proto-jargon" which is its main foundation.

Pacific Northwest historians are well acquainted with the Chinook Jargon, in name if not in the ability to understand it.  Mentions of and phrases of Chinook Jargon were found in nearly every piece of historical source material before 1900.  Chinook Jargon is relatively unknown to the rest of the population, perhaps due to the great influx of newcomers into the influential urban areas. However, the memory of this language is not likely to fade entirely. Many words are still used and enjoyed throughout Oregon, Washington (state)|Washington, British Columbia, the Yukon, and Alaska. Old-timers still dimly remember it, although in their youth, speaking this language was discouraged as slang.  Nonetheless, it was the working language in many towns and workplaces, notably in ranching country and in canneries on the British Columbia Coast where it was necessary in the strongly multi-ethnic workforce.  Place names throughout this region bear Jargon names (see List of Chinook Jargon placenames) and words are preserved in various rural industries such as logging and fishing.

The Chinook Jargon was multicultural and functional.<ref>Thomas, Edward Harper. Chinook: A History and Dictionary. Portland, Ore. Bin fords & Mort. 1935. ISBN|0-8323-0217-1</ref>  To those familiar with it, Chinook Jargon is often considered a wonderful cultural inheritance. For this reason, and because Jargon has not quite died, enthusiasts actively promote the revival of the language in everyday western speech.

Revival of the language
Chinuk Wawa was classified as extinct until the 2000s when it was revived, notably in 2014 with the release of ''Chinuk Wawa—As our elders teach us to speak it'' by the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon. In 2018 a textbook for Chinook Jargon in Esperanto ("[https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/889965 La Chinuka Interlingvo Per Esperanto]", ''The Chinook Bridge-Language Using Esperanto'') was published in both physical and e-book formats by Sequoia Edwards.

During termination of aboriginal peoples by the United States government, speaking of the language was forbidden, and as a result, developed a decline of speakers. After the conclusion of the termination era with the restoration of tribes in the pacific northwest area, revival of Chinuk Wawa began. To date, there are fluent speakers of Chinuk Wawa, primarily in the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde.

Influence on English
British Columbian English and Pacific Northwest English have several words still in current use which are loanwords from the Chinook Jargon, which was widely spoken throughout the Pacific Northwest by all ethnicities well into the middle of the 20th century. These words tend to be shared with, but are not as common in, the states of Oregon, Washington (state)|Washington, Alaska and, to a lesser degree, Idaho and western Montana.

Chinook Jargon words used by English-language speakers<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->
refimprove section|date=January 2015
* Cheechako &mdash; Newcomer; the word is formed from ''chee'' ("new") + ''chako'' ("come") and was used to refer to non-native people.
* Chuck &mdash; Water; and thus ''saltchuck'' "salt water".
* Cultus &mdash; means bad, worthless, useless, ordinary, evil or taboo. ''Cultus iktus'' means "worthless stuff".
* Hiyu &mdash;  less common nowadays, but still heard in some places to mean a party or gathering.  From the Chinook for "many" or "several" or "lots of". The Big Hiyu (also known as "The July") was a week-long joint celebration of Dominion Day and the Glorious Fourth in the Fraser Canyon town of Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet, featuring horse races, gambling, a rodeo and other festivities. A ''tenas hiyu'' (small gathering) was on a much smaller scale. The community of West Seattle has celebrated the month of July for more than 75&nbsp;years with the HiYu Summer Festival.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.hiyu.com|title=hiyu.com|work=hiyu.com</ref>
* Iktus &mdash; "stuff" in Chinook Jargon, also pronounced "itkus" with 't' and 'k' reversed.
* Klootchman or klootch &mdash; in the Jargon meaning simply "a woman" or the female of something &ndash; ''klootchman kiuatan'' (mare), ''klootchman lecosho'' (sow), ''tenas klootchman'' or ''klootchman tenas'' (girl, female child).  Still in use in English in some areas and with people of an older background to mean a First Nations woman, or to refer to the wives/women attached to a certain group in a joking way e.g. "we sent all the klootchman to the kitchen while we played cards".  Unlike its male equivalent ''siwash'', ''klootchman'' does not generally have a derisive tone nowadays (when used).
* Masi  &mdash; In northern BC and the Yukon, and used in broadcast English in those areas, the Chinook Jargon adaption of the French ''merci'' remains common, i.e. ''mahsi'' or ''masi'', with the accent on the first syllable (unlike in French).
* It is possible that the slang term Slang terms for money|moolah, meaning money in American slang, comes from the word 'moolah' meaning 'mill' in Chinook.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.cayoosh.net/hiyu/money.html#engl|title=Cayoosh|work=cayoosh.net|access-date=2011-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805211632/http://www.cayoosh.net/hiyu/money.html#engl#engl|archive-date=2011-08-05|dead-url=yes|df=</ref>
* Potlatch &mdash; in Chinook Jargon is a ceremony among certain tribes involving food and exchange of gifts, nowadays sometimes used to refer to a potluck dinner or sometimes the giving away of personal items to friends.
* Quiggly|Quiggly, quiggly hole &mdash; refers to the remains of an old Indian pit-house, or underground house, from ''kickwillie'' or ''kekuli'', which in the Jargon means "down" or "underneath" or "beneath".
* Siwash (disambiguation)|Siwash &mdash; (SAI-wash) properly a First Nations man, but sometimes used for women as well.  Nowadays considered extremely derogatory but still in use, typically with the connotation of "drunken no-good Indian".  Historically it did not necessarily have this connotation and was the generic term for Natives to the point where some writers thought there was a "Siwash tribe" in the region.  The origin of the word is from the French ''sauvage''.  When pronounced Sa-WASH, with the rhythm of the original French, it is used by modern speakers of the Chinook Jargon in Grand Ronde, Oregon with the context of meaning a Native Americans in the United States|Native American, or as an adjective connoting connection to same (the SAI-wash pronunciation is considered offensive in Grand Ronde).
* Skookum &mdash;  The most versatile  &mdash; is ''skookum'', which was used in the Jargon either as a verb auxiliary for ''to be able'' or an adjective for ''able, strong, big, genuine, reliable'' &ndash; which sums up its use in BC English, although there are a wide range of possible usages: a ''skookum house'' is a jail or prison (''house'' in the Jargon could mean anything from a building to a room).  "He's a skookum guy" means that the person is solid and reliable while "we need somebody who's skookum" means that a strong and large person is needed.  A carpenter, after banging a stud into place, might check it and decide, "Yeah, that's skookum".  Asking for affirmation, someone might say "is that skookum" or "is that skookum with you?"  ''Skookum'' can also be translated simply as "O.K." but it means something a bit more emphatic.
* Tillicum &mdash; means "people/person", "family", and "people".
* Tolo &mdash;  used in Western Washington to mean a semi-formal dance, analogous to the homecoming ball, to which girls ask boys. From the Chinook for "to win".
* Tyee &mdash; leader, chief, boss.  Also ''Big Tyee'' in the context of "boss" or well-known person.  In Campbell River and in the sport-fishing business, a really big chinook salmon (Campbell River) is a Tyee.  In the Jargon ''Tyee'' meant chief, and could also be an adjective denoting "big", as with ''tyee salmon'' or ''tyee lamel'' (boss mule). A ''hyas tyee'' means "important/big ruler/leader", i.e. &ndash; king, big boss, important ruler, and is also sometimes used in English in the same way as ''Big Tyee''. e.g. "He was the undisputed hyas tyee of all the country between the Johnstone Strait and Comox" This was also the common title used for the famous chiefs of the early era, such as Maquinna, for whom it was applied by Captain Vancouver and others in the context of "king". The ''Hyas Klootchman Tyee'' &ndash; "Great Woman Ruler", roughly "Her Majesty", was the historical term for Queen Victoria.  The word ''tyee'' was commonly used and still occurs in some local English usages meaning "boss" or someone in charge. Business and local political and community figures of a certain stature from some areas are sometimes referred to in the British Columbia papers and histories by the old chiefly name worn by Maquinna, Comcomly|Concomly and Nicola (Okanagan leader)|Nicola. A man called ''hyas tyee'' would have been a senator, a longtime MP or MLA, or a business magnate with a strong local powerbase, long-time connections, and wealth from and because of the area. There is a popular British Columbia|BC news site named ''The Tyee''. Beginning in 1900, ''Tyee'' was also the title of the University of Washington Yearbook.<ref>[https://content.lib.washington.edu/uwdocsweb/index.html University of Washington Yearbooks and Documents]</ref>
