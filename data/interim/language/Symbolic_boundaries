Symbolic boundaries are a theory of how people form social groups proposed by cultural sociology|cultural sociologists.
Symbolic boundaries are “conceptual distinctions made by social actors…that separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership.”<ref name=LamontMolnar2002>Michele Lamont|Lamont, Michele and Virag Molnar. 2002. "The Study of Boundaries in the Social Sciences" Annual Review of Sociology. 28:167-95</ref>

Symbolic boundaries are a necessary but insufficient condition for social change. Only when symbolic boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character and become social boundaries.<ref name=LamontMolnar2002/>

Durkheim

Émile Durkheim saw the symbolic boundary between sacred and profane as the most profound of all social facts, and the one from which lesser symbolic boundaries were derived.<ref>Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971[1915]) p. 38</ref>
Rituals - secular or religious - were for Durkheim the means by which groups maintained their symbolic/moral boundaries.<ref>Kenneth Allen, ''Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory'' (2009) p. 120</ref> 

Mary Douglas has subsequently emphasised the role of symbolic boundaries in organising experience, private and public, even in a secular society;<ref>Mary Douglas, ''Natural Symbols'' (2002) p. 50-1</ref> while other neo-Durkheimians highlight the role of Deviance (sociology)|deviancy as one of revealing and making plain the symbolic boundaries that uphold moral order, and of providing an opportunity for  their communal reinforcement.<ref>Annalee R. Ward, '' Mouse Morality'' (2002) p. 38</ref> As Durkheim himself put it, "Crime brings together upright consciences and concentrates them...to talk of the event and wax indignant in common",<ref>Quoted in Peter Worsley ed., ''The New Modern Sociology Readings'' (1991) p. 480</ref> thereby reaffirming the collective barriers that have been breached.

Transgressing boundaries

Prejudice is often the result of crossing the symbolic boundaries that preserve a group's sense of itself - boundaries that as with a nation's frontiers may in fact be real as well as symbolic.<ref>C. Cunningham, ''Prejudice'' (2000) p. 18</ref> (The ancient ceremony of beating the bounds highlights that overlapping of real and symbolic bounds).<ref>François Laroque, ''Shakespeare's Festive World'' (1991) p. 13</ref> Salman Rushdie has emphasised the role of the migrant as a Postmodernity|postmodern representative, transgressing symbolic boundaries, and (potentially at least) demonised by their upholders in the host nation as a result.<ref>Salman Rushdie, ''Imaginary Homelands'' (1991) p. 278-9 and p. 402</ref>

Marjorie Garber has explored the role of the Transvestism|transvestite in crossing the symbolic boundaries of gender - something which she considered tended to challenge those of race as well.<ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 125</ref>

Symbolic/social boundaries

Symbolic boundaries are distinct from “social boundaries" that are "objectified forms of social differences manifested in unequal access to an unequal distribution of resources… and social opportunities.”<ref name=LamontMolnar2002/>

Play

Play (activity)|Playing may be seen as a way of testing social boundaries - the unspoken Frame analysis|frames set about social activities.<ref>Gerry Bloustien, ''Girl Making'' (2003) p. 117</ref> Humour too provides a way of illuminating, testing and perhaps also shifting symbolic boundaries.<ref>P. Morey/A. Yaqin, ''Framing Muslims'' (2011) p. 199-204</ref>

Cultural examples

* Michael Jackson, in Garber's opinion, erases and detraumatises not only the boundaries between male and female, youth and age, but also between black and white internalising cultural category crises.<ref>Quoted in Phillips, p. 128</ref>
