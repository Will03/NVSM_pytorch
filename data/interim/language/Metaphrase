Metaphrase is a term referring to literal translation, i.e., "word by word and line by line"<ref>''Ovid's Epistles'', Preface by John Dryden, London: Jacob Tonson, 1681, cited in Baker, Malmkjær, p. 153</ref> translation. In everyday usage, metaphrase means wikt:literalism|literalism; however, metaphrase is also the translation of poetry into prose.<ref>Andrew Dousa Hepburn, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xn6hVCo6dnYC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=metaphrase+rhetoric&source=bl&ots=-5LjQX7bDs&sig=Tl3rk4o1Cg4x9lT9SlcfBmlR7sQ&hl=en&ei=oJrkSp_MOMThsAbp9YCDAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CBYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=&f=false Manual of English Rhetoric]'', BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008, ISBN|0-559-76232-1, p.18</ref> Unlike "paraphrase," which has an ordinary use in literature theory, the term "metaphrase" is only used in translation theory.<ref name=Baker154>Baker, Malmkjær, p. 154</ref> 

Metaphrase is one of the three ways of transferring, along with paraphrase and imitation,<ref name=Baker153>Baker, Malmkjær, p. 153</ref> according to John Dryden. Dryden considers paraphrase preferable to metaphrase (as literal translation) and imitation. 

The term "metaphrase" is first used by Philo Judaeus (20 BCE) in ''De vita Mosis''.<ref name=Baker153/> Quintilian draws a distinction between metaphrase and paraphrase in the pedagogy|pedagogical practice of imitation and reworking classical texts; he points out that metaphrase changes a word, and paraphrase, a phrase: a distinction that is also followed by  Renaissance scholars.<ref name=Baker154/>
