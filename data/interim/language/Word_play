Word play or wordplay<ref>cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/wordplay?view=get |title=wordplay: definition of wordplay in Oxford dictionary (British & World English) |publisher=Askoxford.com |date=31 July 2013|accessdate=6 August 2013</ref> (also: play-on-words) is a literary technique and a form of wit in which words used become the main subject of the work, primarily for the purpose of intended effect or amusement. Examples of word play include puns, phonetic mix-ups such as spoonerisms, obscure words and meanings, clever rhetorical excursions, oddly formed sentences, double entendres, and telling character names (such as in the play ''The Importance of Being Earnest'', ''Ernest'' being a given name that sounds exactly like the adjective ''earnest'').

Word play is quite common in oral cultures as a method of reinforcing meaning. Examples of text-based (orthography|orthographic) word play are found in languages with or without alphabet-based scripts; for example, see homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese.

Some techniques often used in word play include interpreting idioms literally and creating contradictions and redundancies, as in Tom Swifties:
:"Hurry up and get to the back of the ship," Tom said sternly.

Fossilization (linguistics)|Linguistic fossils and set phrases are often manipulated for word play, as in Wellerisms:
:"We'll have to rehearse that," said the undertaker as the coffin fell out of the car.
Another use of fossils is in using antonyms of unpaired words – "I was well-coiffed and sheveled," (back-formation from "disheveled").

Most writers engage in word play to some extent, but certain writers are particularly committed to, or adept at, word play as a major feature of their work . Shakespeare's "quibbles" have made him a noted punster. Similarly, P.G. Wodehouse was hailed by ''The Times'' as a "comic genius recognized in his lifetime as a classic and an old master of farce" for his own acclaimed wordplay.Citation needed|date=October 2008 James Joyce, author of ''Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses'', is another noted word-player. For example, in his ''Finnegans Wake'' Joyce's phrase "they were yung and easily freudened" clearly implies the more conventional "they were young and easily frightened"; however, the former also makes an apt pun on the names of two famous psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts, Carl Jung|Jung and Sigmund Freud|Freud.

:But 'Wood' would not rhyme with gun
:But 'Bun' would.
