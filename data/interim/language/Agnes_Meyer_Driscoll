Agnes Meyer Driscoll (July 24, 1889 – September 16, 1971), known as ''Miss Aggie'' or ''Madame X'', was an United States|American
cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst during both World War I and World War II. Edwin T. Layton described her as "without peer as a cryptanalyst".<ref>cite web|title=Agnes Meyer Driscoll |url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/driscoll.htm |website=Agnes Meyer Driscoll |accessdate=14 June 2014 |location=Website cites the book "And I Was There" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726113217/http://www.nsa.gov/women/women00021.cfm |archivedate=26 July 2008 |df= </ref>

Early years
Born in Illinois in 1889, Agnes May Meyer moved with her family to Westerville, Ohio in 1895 where her father, Gustav Meyer, had taken a job teaching music at Otterbein College. In 1909 he donated the family home to the Anti-Saloon League, which had recently moved its headquarters to Westerville.

Education
Meyer attended Otterbein College from 1907 to 1909. In 1911, she received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Ohio State University, having majored in mathematics and physics<ref name=nsaBrief>cite web|title=Agnes Meyer Driscoll|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/women/honorees/driscoll.shtml|website=Women in american Cryptology|publisher=NSA|accessdate=14 June 2014</ref> and studied foreign languages, statistics, and music.<ref>cite web|title=Agnes Meyer Driscoll |url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/driscoll.htm |website=Biographies of Women Mathematicians |accessdate=14 June 2014 |location=Website cites the book "The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726113217/http://www.nsa.gov/women/women00021.cfm |archivedate=26 July 2008 |df= </ref> She was fluent in English, French, German, Latin, and Japanese.<ref name=nsaBrief /> From her earliest days as a college student, she pursued technical and scientific studies. After graduation, she moved to Amarillo, Texas, where she lived from 1911 to 1918<ref name=":0">Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Agnes-Meyer-Driscoll|title=Agnes Meyer Driscoll|last=Hanyok|first=Robert|date=|website=|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=August 13, 2016</ref> and worked as director of music at a military academy, and, later, chair of the mathematics department at the local high school.

World War I and after
On June 22, 1918, about one year after America entered World War I, Agnes Meyer enlisted in the United States Navy – America had just started allowing women to enlist.<ref name=nsaAlmanac>cite web|title=Cryptologic Almanac 50th Anniversary Series |url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Madame_X_Agnes_Meyer_Driscoll.pdf |publisher=NSA? |accessdate=14 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918015635/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Madame_X_Agnes_Meyer_Driscoll.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2013 |df= </ref> She was recruited at the highest possible rank of chief yeomanettes|yeoman and after a stint in the Postal Cable and Censorship Office she was assigned to the Code and Signal section of the Director of Naval Communications.<ref name=nsaAlmanac /> After the war ended she made use of an option to continue working at her post as a civilian.<ref name=nsaAlmanac /> Except for a two-year hiatus, when she worked for a private firm, she would remain a leading cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst for the U.S. Navy until 1949.

Her efforts were not limited to manual systems; she was involved also in the emerging machine technology of the time, which was being applied both to making and breaking ciphers. In her first days in the Code and Signal section, she co-developed one of the U.S. Navy's cipher machines, the "Communications Machine|CM." This cipher machine would become a standard enciphering device for the Navy in the 1920s.<ref name=nsaAlmanac /> In 1923, she solved a puzzle published in a magazine that was advertised as impossible. The creator, Edward Hebern of the fledgling Hebern Electric Code Company, was attempting to create a cipher machine; he offered Agnes a job as technical advisor which she left the Navy to accept.<ref>Cite book|title=The Code Breakers|last=Kahn|first=David|publisher=Scribner|year=1996|isbn=978-0-684-83130-5|location=New York|pages=415, 417</ref> She worked on developing an early cipher machine.<ref name=nsaAlmanac /> Although Hebern's company ultimately failed, its work in rotor technology would affect machine cryptography for years to come. Agnes returned to the navy in the spring of 1924. In August 1924 she married Michael Driscoll, a Washington, D.C. lawyer.

In early 1935, Agnes Driscoll led the attack on the Japanese M-1 cipher machine (also known to the U.S. as the ORANGE machine), used to encrypt the messages of Japanese naval attaches around the world.<ref name=":0" /> At the same time she sponsored the introduction of early machine support for cryptanalysis against Japanese naval code systems.

In her thirty-year career, Agnes Driscoll and Lieutenant Joseph Rochefort broke Japanese naval codes|Japanese Navy manual codes—the Red Book Code in 1926 after three years of work,<ref>cite web|title=Monday 201 File: Agnes Meyer Driscoll|url=http://bletchleyparkreview.blogspot.com/2012/07/monday-201-file-agnes-meyer-driscoll.html|website=The Bletchley Park Review (blog)|accessdate=14 June 2014</ref> and the Blue Book Code in 1930, and in 1940 she made critical inroads into JN-25, the Japanese fleet's operational code, which the U.S. Navy exploited after the attack on Pearl Harbor for the rest of the Pacific War. She would be unable to finish this work, however, because she was transferred to a team working to break the German naval Enigma cipher.<ref name=nsaAlmanac />

World War II and after
After getting the work against JN-25 started, Driscoll headed up a new group to attack the German Enigma machine|Enigma ciphers using a catalog approach. Unfortunately the U.S. and U.K. did not communicate effectively and her approach both was fruitless and had been tried by the British, who determined that it was unlikely to work.<ref name=nsaAlmanacTwilight>cite web|title=Madame X: Agnes in Twilight,The Last Years of the Career of Agnes Driscoll, 1941–1957. |url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Madame_X_Agnes_in_Twilight.pdf |publisher=NSA |accessdate=14 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918015634/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Madame_X_Agnes_in_Twilight.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2013 </ref>  Ultimately this work was superseded by the US-UK cryptologic exchanges of 1942–43. She worked under Laurance Safford and Joseph Rochefort.

In 1943 she worked with a team to break the Japanese cipher Coral. It was broken two months later, although Driscoll is said to have had little influence on the project.<ref name=nsaAlmanacTwilight />

In 1945 she appears to have worked on attacking Russian ciphers.<ref name=nsaAlmanacTwilight />

Driscoll was part of the navy contingent that joined the new national cryptologic agencies, firstly the Armed Forces Security Agency in 1949 and then the National Security Agency in 1952. While with the Armed Forces Security Agency she may have contributed to attacking a cipher called Venona project|Venona.<ref name=nsaAlmanacTwilight />

She retired from Armed Forces Security Agency in 1959.<ref name=agnesscott>cite web|title=Agnes Meyer Driscoll |url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/driscoll.htm |website=Biographies of Women Mathematicians |accessdate=14 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726113217/http://www.nsa.gov/women/women00021.cfm |archivedate=26 July 2008 |df= </ref>

Death
She died in 1971 and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.<ref name=agnesscott />

Honors
In 2000 she was inducted into the National Security Agency's Hall of Honor.
