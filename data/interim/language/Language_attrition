Language attrition is the process of losing a First language|native, or first, language. This process is generally caused by both isolation from speakers of the first language  ("L1") and the acquisition and use of a second language ("L2"), which interferes with the correct production and comprehension of the first. Such Language transfer|interference from a second language is likely experienced to some extent by all Multilingualism|bilinguals, but is most evident among speakers for whom a language other than their first has started to play an important, if not dominant, role in everyday life; these speakers are more likely to experience language attrition.<ref name="let.rug.nl">[http://www.let.rug.nl/languageattrition/Papers/Schmid%20&%20Kopke%202007.pdf Köpke, Barbara., Schimd, Monika (2007) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands/Laboratoire de Neuropsycholinguistique, Université de Toulouse, Le Mirail, France "Bilingualism and Attrition"]</ref> It is common among immigrants that travel to countries where languages foreign to them are used.

There are several factors which affect the process. Frequent exposure and use of a particular language is often assumed adequate to maintain the native language system intact. However, research has often failed to confirm this prediction.<ref>[http://babylonia.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/2008-2/schmid_01.pdf Schimd, Monika (2008) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands "Defining Language Attrition"]</ref> A positive attitude towards the potentially attriting language or its speech community and motivation to retain the language are other factors which may reduce attrition. These factors are too difficult to confirm by research.<ref>[http://www.let.rug.nl/languageattrition/Papers/Schmid%20&%20Dusseldorp%202010.pdf Dusseldorp, Elise., Schimd, Monika (2010) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands/TNO, Quality of Life & Leiden University, The Netherlands "Quantitative analyses in a multivariate study of language attrition: The impact of extralinguistic factors"]</ref> However, a person's age can well predict the likelihood of attrition; children are demonstrably more likely to lose their first language than adults.<ref name=":0">cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2009.00521.x | volume=59 | issue=3 | title=Maturational Constraints and First Language Attrition | year=2009 | journal=Language Learning | pages=687–715 | last1 = Bylund | first1 = Emanuel</ref><ref name=":1">[https://books.google.com/bookshl=en&lr=&id=YUQ9AAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR1&dq=K%C3%B6pke,+B.+and+Schmid,+M.S.+2004:+First+language+attrition:+the+next+phase.+In+Schmid,+M.S.,+K%C3%B6pke,+B.,+Keijzer,+M.+and+Weilemar,+L.,+editors,+First+language+attrition:+interdisciplinary+perspectives+on+methodological++issues.+Amsterdam/Philadelphia:+John&ots=qvh0yLDh5l&sig=_8DMmm-r6aBAQ3xedGp7m9Ggotc#v=onepage&q&f=false Köpke & Schmid 2004] Schmid, M.

These factors are similar to those that affect Second-language acquisition|second language acquisition, and the two processes are sometimes compared. However, the overall impact of these factors is far less than that for second language acquisition.

Language attrition results in a decrease of language proficiency. The current consensus is that it manifests itself first and most noticeably in speakers' vocabulary (in their lexical access and their mental lexicon),<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":5">Schmid, M.

Study
The term ''first language attrition'' (FLA) refers to the gradual decline in native language proficiency. As speakers use their L2 frequently and become proficient (or even dominant) in it, some aspects of the L1 can deteriorate or become subject to L2 influence.

The study of language attrition became a subfield of linguistics with a 1980 conference at the University of Pennsylvania called "Loss of Language Skills".<ref>Lambert, Richard D., Freed, Barbara F.. 1982.&nbsp;''The Loss of language skills''. The University of California</ref> The aim of the conference was to discuss areas of second language attrition and to discuss ideas for possible future research. The conference revealed that attrition is a wide topic, with numerous factors and taking many forms. Decades later, the field of first language attrition gained new momentum with two conferences held in Amsterdam in 2002 and 2005, as well as a series of graduate workshops and panels at international conferences, such as the International Symposium on Bilingualism (2007, 2009), the annual conferences of the European Second Language Association, and the AILA World Congress (2008). The outcomes of some of these meetings were later published in edited volumes.<ref name="Shmid, Monika 2004">cite journal | last1 = Shmid | first1 = Monika | year = 2004 | title = First language attrition: The methodology revised | url = | journal = International Journal of Bilingualism | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 239–255 </ref><ref name="let.rug.nl"/>

To study the process of language attrition, researchers initially looked at neighboring areas of linguistics to identify which parts of the L1 system attrite first; lacking years of direct experimental data, linguists studied language contact, Creole genesis|creolization, Second-language acquisition|L2 acquisition, and aphasia, and applied their findings to language acquisition.<ref name="Shmid, Monika 2004"/>

One issue that is faced when researching attrition is distinguishing between normal L2 influence on the L1 and actual attrition of the L1. Since all bilinguals experience some degree of Crosslinguistic influence|cross linguistic influence, where the L2 interferes with the retrieval of the speaker's L1, it is difficult to determine if delays and/or mistakes in the L1 are due to attrition or cause by CLI.<ref>cite book | last1 = Larsen-Freeman | first1 = D. | last2 = Schmid | first2 = M.

Manifestations
=Lexical attrition=

The first linguistic system to be affected by first language attrition is the lexicon.<ref>cite book | last1 = Köpke | first1 = B. | last2 = Schimd | first2 = M. S. | last3 = Keijzer | first3 = M. C. | last4 = Dostert | first4 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Language attrition: theoretical perspectives | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism | volume =  33| issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1075/sibil.33 | isbn = 978 90 272 4144 3 </ref> The lexical-semantic relationship usually starts to deteriorate first and most quickly, driven by Cross Linguistic Interference (CLI) from the speaker's L2, and it is believed to be exacerbated by continued exposure to, and frequent use of, the L2.<ref name="Schmid, M. S. 2014">cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Jarvis | first2 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Lexical access and lexical diversity in first language attrition | url = http://repository.essex.ac.uk/11515/1/Schmid_Jarvis_BLC.pdf| journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 729–748 | doi = 10.1017/s1366728913000771 </ref> Evidence for such interlanguage effects can be seen in a study by Pavlenko (2003, 2004) which shows that there was some semantic extension from the L2, which was English, into the L1 Russian speakers' lexicons. In order to test for lexical attrition, researchers used tests such as picture naming tasks, where they place a picture of an item in front of the participant and ask them to name it, or by measuring lexical diversity in the speaker's spontaneous speech (speech that is unprompted and improvised). In both cases, attriters performed worse than non-attriters.<ref name=":6">Ammerlaan, T. (1996).

S. 2014"/>

=Grammatical attrition=

Grammatical attrition can be defined as "the disintegration of the structure of a first language (L1) in contact situations with a second language (L2)".<ref>Seliger, H. W., & Vago, R. M. (1991). First language attrition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> In a study of bilingual Swedes raised outside of Sweden, who in their late twenties returned to their home country for schooling, there was noted to be attrition of their L1. The participants demonstrated a complete retention of the underlying syntactic structure of their L1. Notably, they exhibited the V2, verb second, word order present in most Germanic languages, except English. This rule requires the tense-marked verb of a main clause to occur in the second position of the sentence, even if that means it comes before the subject (e.g. there is an adverb at the beginning of the sentence). These speakers' ability to form sentences with V2 word order was compared against L2 learners who often overproduce the rigid SVO word order rather than applying the V2 rule. Although the study did not show evidence for attrition of syntax of the person's L1, there was evidence for attrition in the expatriates' morphology, especially in terms of agreement. They found that the bilinguals would choose to use the unmarked morphemes in place of the marked one when having to differentiate between gender and plurality; also they tend to overgeneralize where certain morphemes can be used. For example, they may use the suffix /-a/, which is used to express an indefinite plural, and overextend this morpheme to also represent the indefinite singular.<ref>cite journal | last1 = Håkansson | first1 = G | year = 1995 | title = Syntax and morphology in language attrition: a study of five bilingual expatriate Swedes | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Linguistics | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 153–169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1473-4192.1995.tb00078.x </ref> There is little evidence to support the view that there is a complete restructuring of the language systems. That is, even under language attrition the syntax is largely unaffected and any variability observed is thought to be due to interference from another language, rather than attrition.<ref name=":11">Tsimpli, I., Sorace, A., Heycock, C., & Filiaci, F.

L1 attriters, like L2 learners, may use language differently from native speakers. In particular, they can have variability on certain rules which native speakers apply deterministically.<ref>Sorace, A. 2005. "Selective optionality in language development". In: Cornips, L. & Corrigan, K. P., (eds.),&nbsp;''Syntax and Variation: reconciling the biological and the social'', pp.&nbsp;55–80 Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.</ref><ref name=":11" /> In the context of attrition, however, there is strong evidence that this optionality is not indicative of any underlying representational deficits: the same individuals do not appear to encounter recurring problems with the same kinds of grammatical phenomena in different speech situations or on different tasks.<ref name=":8" /> This suggests that problems of L1 attriters are due to momentary conflicts between the two linguistic systems and not indicative of a structural change to underlying linguistic knowledge (that is, to an emerging representational deficit of any kind). This assumption is in line with a range of investigations of L1 attrition which argue that this process may affect interface phenomena (e.g. the distribution of overt and null subjects in pro-drop languages) but will not touch the narrow syntax.<ref name=":11" /><ref>Montrul, S. 2004.

=Phonological attrition=

Phonological attrition is a form of language loss that affects the speaker's ability to produce their native language with their native accent. A study of five native speakers of American English who moved to Brazil and learned Portuguese as their L2 demonstrates the possibility that one could lose one's L1 accent in place of an accent that is directly influenced by the L2.citation needed|date=April 2017 It is thought that phonological loss can occur to those who are closer to native-like fluency in the L2, especially in terms of phonological production, and for those who have immersed themselves and built a connection to the culture of the country for the L2.citation needed|date=April 2017 A sociolinguistic approach to this phenomenon is that the acquisition of a native-like L2 accent and the subsequent loss of one's native accent is influenced by the societal norms of the country and the speakers' attempt to adapt in order to feel a part of the culture they are trying to assimilate into.<ref>Major, R. (1994). Sociolinguistic factors in loss and acquisition of phonology. In K. Hyltenstam & A. Viberg (Eds.), Progression and Regression in Language: Sociocultural, Neuropsychological and Linguistic Perspectives (pp. 463-478). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. DOI|10.1017/CBO9780511627781.019</ref> This type of attrition is not to be confused with contact-induced change since that would mean speech production changes due to an increased use of another language and not due to the less frequent use of the L1.<ref>Yeh, C., & Lin, Y. (2015). Tonal Change Induced by Language Attrition and Phonetic Similarity in Hai-lu Hakka. Prosody and Language in Contact Prosody, Phonology and Phonetics, 189-220.

Studies and hypotheses
Lambert and Moore<ref>Lambert, R. D. & Moore, S. J. (1986). "Problem Areas in the Study of Language Attrition". In: Weltens, B., de Bot, K. & van Els, T. (eds.),&nbsp;''Language Attrition in Progress, Studies on Language Acquisition''&nbsp;(p.&nbsp;177 – p.&nbsp;186). Dordrecht, NL: Foris Publications.</ref> attempted to define numerous hypotheses regarding the nature of language loss, crossed with various aspects of language. They envisioned a test to be given to American State Department employees that would include four linguistic categories (syntax, morphology (linguistics)|morphology, lexicon, and phonology) and three skill areas (reading (activity)|reading, listening, and Speech communication|speaking). A translation component would feature on a sub-section of each skill area tested. The test was to include linguistic features that are the most difficult, according to teachers, for students to master. Such a test may confound testing what was not acquired with what was lost. Lambert, in personal communication with Köpke and Schmid,<ref name=":1" /> described the results as 'not substantial enough to help much in the development of the new field of language skill attrition'.

The use of translation tests to study language loss is inappropriate for a number of reasons: it is questionable what such tests measure; too much Variation (linguistics)|variation; the difference between attriters and multilingualism|bilinguals is complex; activating two languages at once may cause interference. Yoshitomi<ref name=":12">Yoshitomi, A. (1992). "Towards a Model of Language Attrition: neurological and psychological contributions". In:&nbsp;''Issues in Applied Linguistics''; Vol 3, No 2: 293-318.</ref> attempted to define a model of language attrition that was related to neurological and psychological aspects of language learning and unlearning. She discussed four possible hypotheses and five key aspects related to acquisition and attrition. The hypotheses are:
* 1. Reverse order: last learned, first forgotten. Studies by Russell<ref>Russell, Robert (1999). "Lexical maintenance and attrition in Japanese as a second language". In: Hansen, Lynne (ed.).''Second Language Attrition: evidence from Japanese contexts''&nbsp;(p.&nbsp;114 – p.&nbsp;141). Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> and Hayashi<ref>Hayashi, Brenda (1999). "Testing the regression hypotheis: the remains of the Japanese negation system in Micronesia". In: Hansen, Lynne (ed.).&nbsp;''Second Language Attrition: evidence from Japanese contexts''&nbsp;(p.&nbsp;154 – p.&nbsp;168). Oxford: Oxford University Press</ref> both looked at the Japanese negation system and both found that attrition was the reverse order of acquisition. Yoshitomi and others, including Yukawa,<ref name=":13">Yukawa, E. (1998).&nbsp;''L1 Japanese Attrition and Regaining: three case studies of two early bilingual children''. Tokyo: Kurosio Publishers</ref> argue that attrition can occur so rapidly, it is impossible to determine the order of loss.
* 2. Inverse relation: better learned, better retained. Language items that are acquired first also happen to be those that are most reinforced. As a result, hypotheses 1 and 2 ''capture the main linguistic characteristics of language attrition''<ref name=":12" />
* 3. Critical period: at or around age 9. As a child grows, he becomes less able to master native-like abilities. Furthermore, various linguistic features (for example phonology or syntax) may have different stages or age limits for mastering. Hyltenstam & Abrahamsson<ref>cite book | last1 = Hyltenstam | first1 = K. | last2 = Viberg | first2 = A. | year = 1994 | title = Progression & Regression in Language: sociocultural, neuropsychological, & linguistic perspectives | url = | journal = | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511627781 | isbn = 9780511627781 </ref> argue that after childhood, in general, it becomes more and more difficult to acquire "native-like-ness", but that there is no cut-off point in particular. Furthermore, they discuss a number of cases where a native-like L2 was acquired during adulthood.
* 4. Affect: motivation and attitude.

According to Yoshitomi,<ref name=":12" /> the five key aspects related to attrition are neuroplasticity, consolidation, permastore/savings, decreased accessibility, and receptive versus productive abilities.

= The regression hypothesis =
The regression hypothesis, first formulated by Roman Jakobson in 1941 and originally formulated on the phonology of only Slavic languages,<ref name=":52">[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=7i8ZLfGKcjcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA31&dq=de+Bot,+K.+%26+B.+Weltens+(1991).+Recapitulation,+regression,+and+language+loss.+In+SELIGER+%26+VAGO+(eds),+31-51.&ots=vX7Qy11wyl&sig=Oe1D7OsTmyLCi7QLBl-cesHMuLE#v=onepage&q&f=false De Bot (1991)] De Bot, K., & Weltens, B. (1991). Recapitulation, regression, and language loss. First language attrition, 31-51.</ref> goes back to the beginnings of psychology and psychoanalysis. It states that that which was learned first will be retained last, both in 'normal' processes of forgetting and in pathological conditions such as aphasia or dementia.<ref name=":52" /> As a template for language attrition, the regression hypothesis has long seemed an attractive paradigm. However, regression is not in itself a theoretical or explanatory framework.<ref name=":52" /><ref name=":62">cite journal | last1 = Keijzer | first1 = M | year = 2007 | title = Last in first out?: An investigation of the regression hypothesis in Dutch emigrants in Anglophone Canada | url = | journal = Toegepaste Taalwetenschap in Artikelen | volume = 78 | issue = 1| pages = 131–139 | doi=10.1075/ttwia.78.12kei| hdl = 1871/13268 </ref> Both order of acquisition and order of attrition need to be put into the larger context of linguistic theory in order to gain explanatory adequacy.<ref name=":7">cite journal | last1 = Keijzer | first1 = M | year = 2010 | title = The regression hypothesis as a framework for first language attrition | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 9–18 | doi=10.1017/s1366728909990356</ref>

Keijzer (2007) conducted a study on the attrition of Dutch in Anglophone Canada. She finds some evidence that later-learned rules, such as diminutive and plural formation, indeed erode before earlier learned grammatical rules.<ref name=":62" /> However, there is also considerable interaction between the first and second language and so a straightforward 'regression pattern' cannot be observed.<ref name=":62" /> Also, parallels in noun and verb phrase morphology could be present because of the nature of the tests or because of avoidance by the participants.<ref name=":62" /> In a follow up 2010 article, Keijzer suggests that the regression hypothesis may be more applicable to morphology than to syntax.<ref name=":7" />

Citing the studies on the regression hypothesis that have been done, Yukawa<ref name=":13" /> says that the results have been contradictory. It is possible that attrition is a case-by-case situation depending on a number of variables (age, proficiency,& literacy, the similarities between the L1 and L2, and whether the L1 or the L2 is attriting). The threshold hypothesis states that there may be a level of proficiency that once attained, enables the attriting language to remain stable.

 Factors 

=Age effect=
Children are more susceptible to (first) language attrition than adults.<ref name=":0"/><ref name=":1"/><ref name=":2"/> Research shows an age effect around the ages of 8 through 13.<ref name=":2" /> Before this time period, a first language can attrite under certain circumstances, the most prominent being a sudden decline in exposure to the first language. Various case studies show that children who emigrate before puberty and have little to no exposure to their first language end up losing the first language. In 2009, a study compared two groups of Swedish-speaking groups: native Swedish speakers and Korean international adoptees who were at risk for losing their Korean.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3">cite journal | last1 = Hyltenstam | first1 = K. | last2 = Bylund | first2 = E. | last3 = Abrahamsson | first3 = N. | last4 = Park | first4 = H. S. | year = 2009 | title = Dominant-language replacement: The case of international adoptees | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 121–140 | doi=10.1017/s1366728908004008</ref> Of the Korean adoptees, those who were adopted the earliest essentially lost their Korean and those adopted later still retained some of it, although it was primarily their comprehension of Korean that was spared.<ref name=":3" /> A 2007 study looked at Korean adoptees in France and found that they performed on par with native French speakers in French proficiency and Korean.<ref name=":4">[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1615/ab35ebe2c40dfbb5463b3e1a66b67a6c3563.pdf Pallier 2007] Pallier, C. (2007). Critical periods in language acquisition and language attrition. Language attrition: Theoretical perspectives, 155-168.</ref>

Attrition of a first language does not guarantee an advantage in learning a second language.<ref name=":3" /> Attriters are outperformed by native speakers of the second language in proficiency.<ref name=":3" /> A 2009 study tested the Swedish proficiency of Swedish speakers who had attrited knowledge of Spanish. These participants did show almost but not quite native-like proficiency when compared to native Swedish speakers, and they did not show an advantage when compared with bilingual Swedish-Spanish speakers.<ref name=":3" />

On the other hand, L1 attrition may also occur if the overall effort to maintain the first language is insufficient while exposed to a dominant L2 environment. Another recent investigation, focussing on the development of language in late bilinguals (i.e. adults past puberty), has claimed that maintenance of the mother tongue in an L1 environment requires little to no maintenance for individuals, whereas those in the L2 environment have an additive requirement for the maintenance of the L1 and the development of the L2 (Optiz, 2013).<ref>Cite journal|last=Opitz|first=Conny|date=2013-12-01|title=A dynamic perspective on late bilinguals' linguistic development in an L2 environment|url=http://ijb.sagepub.com/content/17/6/701|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|language=en|volume=17|issue=6|pages=701–715|doi=10.1177/1367006912454621|issn=1367-0069</ref>

there have been cases in which adults have undergone first language attrition. A 2011 study tested adult monolingual English speakers, adult monolingual Russian speakers and adult bilingual English-Russian speakers on naming various liquid containers (cup, glass, mug, etc.) in both English and Russian.<ref>Cite journal|last=Pavlenko|first=Aneta|last2=Malt|first2=Barbara C.|date=2011|title=Kitchen Russian: Cross-linguistic differences and first-language object naming by Russian-English bilinguals|url=|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|volume=14|pages=19–45|doi=10.1017/s136672891000026x</ref> The results showed that the bilinguals had attrited Russian vocabulary because they did not label these liquid containers the same way as the monolingual Russian speakers. When grouped according to Age of Acquisition (AoA) of English, the bilinguals showed an effect of AoA (or perhaps length of exposure to the L2) in that bilinguals with earlier AoA (mean AoA 3.4 years) exhibited much stronger attrition than bilinguals with later AoA (mean AoA 22.8 years). That is, the individuals with earlier AoA were the more different from monolingual Russian speakers in their labeling and categorization of drinking vessels, than the people with later AoA. However, even the late AoA bilinguals exhibited some degree of attrition in that they labeled the drinking vessels differently from native monolingual Russian-speaking adults.

 Critical period hypothesis 
Given that exposure to an L2 at a younger age typically leads to stronger attrition of the L1 than L2 exposure at later ages, there may be a relationship between language attrition and the critical period hypothesis. The critical period for language claims that there is an optimal time period for humans to acquire language, and after this time language acquisition is more difficult (though not impossible). Language attrition also seems to have a time period; before around age 12, a first language is most susceptible to attrition if there is reduced exposure to that language.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> Research shows that the complete attrition of a language would occur before the critical period ends.<ref name=":1" />

All available evidence on the age effect for L1 attrition therefore indicates that the development of susceptibility displays a curved, not a linear, function. This suggests that in native language learning there is indeed a Critical Period effect, and that full development of native language capacities necessitates exposure to L1 input for the entire duration of this CP.

L2 attrition

In Hansen & Reetz-Kurashige (1999), Hansen cites her own research on L2-Hindi and Urdu attrition in young children. As young pre-school children in India and Pakistan, the subjects of her study were often judged to be native speakers of Hindi or Urdu; their mother was far less proficient. On return visits to their home country, the United States, both children appeared to lose all their L2 while the mother noticed no decline in her own L2 abilities. Twenty years later, those same young children as adults ''comprehend not a word from recordings of their own animated conversations in Hindi-Urdu; the mother still understands much of them''.

Yamamoto (2001) found a link between age and bilinguality. In fact, a number of factors are at play in bilingual families. In her study, bicultural families that maintained only one language, the minority language, in the household, were able to raise bilingual, bicultural children without fail. Families that adopted the one parent – one language policy were able to raise bilingual children at first but when the children joined the dominant language school system, there was a 50% chance that children would lose their minority language abilities. In families that had more than one child, the older child was most likely to retain two languages, if it was at all possible. Younger siblings in families with more than two other brothers and sisters had little chance of maintaining or ever becoming bilingual.

There are few principled and systematic investigations of FLA specifically investigating the impact of AoA. However, converging evidence suggests an age effect on FLA which is much stronger and more clearly delineated than the effects that have been found in SLA research. Two studies that consider prepuberty and postpuberty migrants (Ammerlaan, 1996, AoA 0–29 yrs; Pelc, 2001, AoA 8–32 years) find that AoA is one of the most important predictors of ultimate proficiency, and a number of studies that investigate the impact of age among postpuberty migrants fail to find any effect at all (Köpke, 1999, AoA 14–36 yrs; Schmid, 2002, AoA 12–29 yrs; Schmid, 2007, AoA 17–51 yrs). A range of studies conducted by Montrul on Spanish heritage speakers in the US as well as Spanish-English bilinguals with varying levels of AoA also suggests that the L1 system of early bilinguals may be similar to that of L2 speakers, while later learners pattern with monolinguals in their L1 (e.g. Montrul, 2008; Montrul, 2009). These findings therefore indicate strongly that early (prepuberty) and late (postpuberty) exposure to an L2 environment have a different impact on possible fossilization and/or deterioration of the linguistic system.

=Frequency of use=
Frequency of use has been shown to be an important factor in language attrition.<ref name=":16">Cite book|title=Prosody and Language in Contact: L2 Acquisition, Attrition and Languages in Multilingual Situations|last=Yeh|first=Chia-Hsin|last2=Lin|first2=Yen-Hwei|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=London|pages=194|chapter=Chapter 10: Tonal Change Induced by Language Attrition and Phonetic Similarity in Hai-lu Hakka</ref> Decline in use of a given language leads to gradual loss of that language.<ref name=":17">Cite book|title=First language attrition|last=Seliger|first=Herbert L.|last2=Vago|first2=Robert M.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=4</ref><ref name=":18">Cite book|title=Understanding Interfaces: Second language acquisition and first language attrition of Spanish subject realization and word order variation|last=Domínguez|first=Laura|publisher=John Benjamins|year=2013|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=167</ref>

In the face of much evidence to the contrary, one study is often cited to suggest that frequency of use does not correlate strongly with language attrition.<ref name=":19">Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254809520|title=Social Determinants of Language Loss|journal=Itl - International Journal of Applied Linguistics|volume=83-84|pages=75–98|last=Jaspaert|first=Koen|last2=Kroon|first2=S.|date=January 1989|access-date=|doi=10.1075/itl.83-84.07jas</ref> Their methodology, however, can be called into question, especially concerning the small sample size and the reliance on self reported data.<ref name=":20">Cite book|title=First Language Attrition: Interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues|last=Köpke|first=Barbara|last2=Schmid|first2=Monika S.|publisher=John Benjamins|year=2004|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=14</ref> The researchers themselves state that their findings may be inaccurate.<ref name=":19" /> The overall evidence suggests that frequency of use is a strong indicator of language attrition.<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":17" /><ref name=":18" /><ref name=":20" />

=Motivation=
Motivation could be defined as the willingness and desire to learn a second language, or, in the case of attrition, the incentive to maintain a language.<ref name=":14">Cite book|title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction|last=Archibald|first=John|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=496</ref> Motivation can be split into four categories,<ref name=":15">Cite web|url=http://www.academypublication.com/issues/past/tpls/vol01/06/12.pdf|title=The Interrelationship of Instrumental, Integrative, Intrinsic, and Extrinsic Motivations and the Lexical-oriented Knowledge among Persian EFL Language Learners|last=Soureshjani|first=Kamal Heidari|last2=Naseri|first2=Noushin|date=June 2011|website=|access-date=</ref> but it is often simply split into two distinct forms: the instrumental and the integrative.<ref name=":14" /><ref name=":15" /> Instrumental motivation, in the case of attrition, is the desire to maintain a language in order to complete a specific goal, i.e. maintaining a language to maintain a job. Integrative motivation, however, is motivation that comes from a desire to fit in or maintain one's cultural ties.<ref name=":15" /> These inferences can be drawn, as strategies for knowledge maintenance will, by definition, precisely oppose actions that lead to forgetting.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227983368|title=Language attrition|last=Schmid|first=Monika S.|last2=de Bot|first2=Kees|date=2003|website=|access-date=</ref>

There are differences in attrition related to motivation depending on the type at hand. Instrumental motivation is often less potent than integrative motivation, but, given sufficient incentives, it can be equally as powerful.<ref name=":14" /> A 1972 study by Gardner and Lambert emphasized the importance of integrative motivation in particular in regards to factors relating to language acquisition, and, by extension, language attrition.<ref>Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281000889X|title=Attitude, motivation, and difficulties involved in learning the English language and factors that affect motivation in learning it|last=Al Rifai|first=Nada|date=2010|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.849|volume=2|issue=2|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages=5216–5227</ref>
