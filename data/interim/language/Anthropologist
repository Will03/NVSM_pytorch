Education
Anthropologists usually cover a breadth of topics within anthropology in their undergraduate education, and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the Postgraduate education|graduate level. In some universities, a qualifying exam serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of anthropology; the students who pass are permitted to work on a doctoral dissertation.

Anthropologists typically hold graduate degrees, either doctorates or master's degrees. Not holding an advanced degree is rare in the field. Some anthropologists hold undergraduate degrees in other fields than anthropology and graduate degrees in anthropology.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1782|title=Career Paths and Education - Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29</ref>

Although closely related and often grouped with archaeology, anthropologists and archeologists perform differing roles, though archeology is considered a sub-discipline of anthropology.<ref name=":0" /> While both professions focus on the study of human culture from past to present, archaeologists focus specifically on analyzing material remains such as artifacts and architectural remains.<ref name=":0">Cite web|url=http://www.paesta.psu.edu/book/earth-systems-science-introduction/definitions/paleontology-vs-archaeology-vs-anthropology|title=Paleontology vs. Archaeology vs. Anthropology ! PAESTA|website=www.paesta.psu.edu|access-date=2017-11-29</ref> Anthropology encompasses a wider range of professions including the rising fields of forensic anthropology, digital anthropology, and cyber anthropology. The role of an anthropologist differs as well from that of a historian. While anthropologists focus their studies on humans and human behavior, historians look at events from a broader perspective.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.careerigniter.com/questions/what-is-the-difference-between-a-historian-and-an-anthropologist/|title=What Is The Difference Between A Historian And An Anthropologist? - Career Igniter|website=www.careerigniter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29</ref> Historians also tend to focus less on culture than anthropologists in their studies.
