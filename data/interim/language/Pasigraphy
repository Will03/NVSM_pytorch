A pasigraphy (from Ancient Greek|Greek πᾶσι ''pasi'' "to all" and γράφω ''grapho'' "to write") is a writing system where each written symbol represents a concept (rather than a word or sound or series of sounds in a spoken language).

The aim (as with ordinary numerals 1, 2, 3, etc.) is to be intelligible to persons of all languages. The term was first applied to a system proposed in 1796, though a number of pasigraphies had been devised prior to that; Leopold Einstein reviews 60 attempts at creating an international auxiliary language, the majority of the 17th–18th century projects being pasigraphies of one kind or another,<ref name="einstein1884">Leopold Einstein, "Al la historio de la Provoj de Lingvoj Tutmondaj de Leibniz ĝis la Nuna Tempo", 1884. Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', UEA 1992 [1903].</ref> and several pasigraphies and auxiliary languages, including some sample texts, are also reviewed in Arika Okrent's book on constructed languages.<ref name="okrent2009">Arika Okrent, ''In The Land of Invented Languages'', Spiegel & Grau 2009 (ISBN|0385527888).</ref> Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz wrote about the alphabet of human thought and Alexander von Humboldt corresponded with Peter Stephen Du Ponceau who proposed a universal phonemic orthography|phonetic alphabet.

Examples of pasigraphies include Blissymbols and An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language|Real Character.
