distinguish|Biocommunication (paranormal) 
In the study of the Biology|biological sciences,  biocommunication is any specific type of communication within (intraspecific) or between (Interspecies communication|interspecific) species of plants, animals, fungi, protozoa and microorganisms. Communication basically means sign-mediated interactions following three levels of (syntactic, pragmatics|pragmatic and semantic) rules. Signs in most cases are chemical molecules (semiochemicals), but also tactile, or as in animals also visual and auditive.  Biocommunication of animals may include vocalizations (as between competing bird species), or pheromone production (as between various species of insects),<ref>cite book | last = Ananthakrishnan | first = T | authorlink =  | title = Biocommunication in Insects  | publisher = Science Publishers | year = 1998 |isbn = 1-57808-031-2 | page = 104 </ref> chemical signals between plants and animals (as in tannin production used by vascular plants to warn away insects), and chemically mediated communication between plants<ref>cite web | last = Taiz | first = Lincoln |author2=Eduardo Zeiger  | title = Plant Physiology Online  | work = a companion to Plant Physiology, Third Edition  | publisher = Sinauer Associates  | year = 2002  | url = http://3e.plantphys.net/book.php | accessdate = 2006-12-26 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061207153105/http://3e.plantphys.net/book.php| archivedate = December 7, 2006</ref><ref>cite journal | last = Farmer | first = EE |author2=CA Ryan  | title = Interplant Communication: Airborne Methyl Jasmonate Induces Synthesis of Proteinase Inhibitors in Plant Leaves  | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  | volume = 87  | issue = 19  | pages = 7713–7716 | year = 1990 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/87/19/7713  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.19.7713 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 | pmid=11607107 | pmc=54818</ref> and within plants. 

Biocommunication of fungi demonstrates that mycelia communication integrates interspecific sign-mediated interactions between fungal organisms soil bacteria and plant root cells without which plant nutrition could not be organized. Biocommunication of Archaea represents keylevels of sign-mediated interactions in the evolutionarily oldest akaryotes.

Biocommunication, biosemiotics and linguistics
Biocommunication theory may be considered to be a branch of biosemiotics. Whereas Biosemiotics studies the production and interpretation of signs and codes, biocommunication theory investigates concrete interactions mediated by signs. Accordingly, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic aspects of biocommunication processes are distinguished.<ref>cite book|author=Tembrock, Günter|authorlink=Günter Tembrock|year= 1971|title=Biokommunikation: Informationsübertragung im biologischen Bereich|place= Berlin|publisher=Akademie-Verlag</ref> Biocommunication specific to animals  (animal communication) is considered a branch of zoosemiotics.<ref>Thomas Sebeok|Sebeok, Thomas (ed.) 1977.

Language  hierarchy

Given the complexity and range of biological organisms and the further complexity within the neural organization of any particular animal organism, there is a variety of biocommunication languages.

A hierarchy of biocommunication languages in animals has been proposed by Subhash Kak: these languages, in order  of increasing generality, are associative, re-organizational, and quantum.<ref>Kak, S. The three languages of the brain: quantum, reorganizational, and associative. In Learning as Self-Organization, Karl H. Pribram|Karl Pribram and J. King (editors).
