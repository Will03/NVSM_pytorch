Joan Elisabeth Lowther Murray, Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE (''née'' Clarke; 24 June 1917 – 4 September 1996) was an English cryptanalyst and numismatist best known for her work as a Cryptanalysis|code-breaker at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. Though she did not personally seek the spotlight, her role in the Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma project that decrypted Nazi Germany's secret communications earned her awards and citations, such as appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), in 1946.<ref name=bbc/><ref name="MBE">London Gazette|issue=37412|page=290 |supp=y|date=28 December 1945</ref>

Early life
Joan Elisabeth Lowther Clarke was born on 24 June 1917 in West Norwood, London, England. She was the youngest child of Dorothy (née Fulford) and the Revd William Kemp Lowther Clarke, a clergyman. She had three brothers and one sister.<ref name="LALord"/>

Clarke attended Dulwich High School for Girls in south London and won a scholarship in 1936, to attend Newnham College, Cambridge, where she gained a British undergraduate degree classification#Double first-class honours|double first degree in mathematics and was a Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler.<ref name="ODNB ref">cite web|last=Erskine|first=Ralph|title=Murray [Clarke], Joan Elisabeth Lowther (1917–1996)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/71791|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 October 2013</ref><ref name="BNSobit">cite web |url=http://www.britnumsoc.org/publications/Digital%20BNJ/pdfs/1997_BNJ_67_13.pdf|title=Obituary Mrs J.E.L.

Clarke's mathematical abilities were first discovered by Gordon Welchman, in an undergraduate Geometry class at Cambridge. Welchman was one of the top four mathematicians to be recruited in 1939 to supervise decoding operations at Bletchley Park. After noticing Clarke's mathematical abilities he recruited her to join him at Bletchley Park and be a part of the 'Government Code and Cypher School' (GCCS).

The GCCS started up in 1939 with only one purpose, to break the German Enigma Code. The Enigma Code was a machine the Germans invented to encrypt their messages; they strongly believed their machine was unbreakable. Clarke first arrived at Bletchley Park on 17 June 1940. She was first placed in a group only made up of women referred to as "The Girls", that mainly did routine clerical work. At this time, cryptology was not a job for a woman. According to Clarke, she only knew of one other female cryptologist that worked at Bletchley Park.

Clarke's first work promotion was to Linguist Grade which was designed to earn her extra money despite the fact that she did not speak another language. This promotion was a recognition of her workload and contributions to the team.

In 1941, trawlers were captured as well as their cipher equipment and codes. Before this information was obtained, Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf packs had sunk 282,000 tons of shipping a month from March to June 1941. By November, Clarke and her team were able to reduce this number to 62,000 tons.<ref name=":0">Cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Clarke_Joan.html|title=Clarke_Joan biography|website=www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=3 February 2017</ref> Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander, head of Hut 8 from 1943 to 1944, described her as "one of the best Banburists in the section".<ref name="Burman ref">cite thesis |author= Burman, Annie | others = Mikael Byström, Thesis Supervisor, Torkel Jansson, Seminar leader, [Seminar date, 4 June 2013] |year=1901 | title=Gendering Decryption—Decrypting Gender: The Gender Discourse of Labour at Bletchley Park, 1939–1945 [65 pp.] | type= M.A. | location = Uppsala, SWE | publisher= Uppsala universitet  | url = http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:625771/FULLTEXT01.pdf | access-date = 14 January 2017page needed|date=January 2017</ref>page needed|date=January 2017 Alexander himself was regarded as the best of the Banburists.

Clarke and Turing became very good friends at Bletchley Park. Turing arranged their shifts so they could work together, and they also spent much of their free time together. In early 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Clarke, and subsequently introduced her to his family. Although privately admitting his homosexuality to her—she was reportedly "unfazed" by the revelation—Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage, and broke up with Clarke in mid-1941. Clarke later admitted that she suspected Turing's homosexuality for some time, and it was not much of a surprise when he made the admission to her.<ref>Cite book | last = Leavitt | first = David | authorlink = David Leavitt | year = 2006 | title = The Man Who Knew Too Much: Alan Turing and the Invention of the Computer | location = New York | publisher= W.W.Norton | isbn = 9780393329094 | pages=176–178 | url = http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-Man-Who-Knew-Too-Much/ | access-date = 14 January 2017 </ref><ref>cite web|last=Grime |first=James |url=http://aperiodical.com/2014/07/an-alan-turing-expert-watches-the-the-imitation-game-trailer/ | title=An Alan Turing expert watches the sic|hide=y|reason=double 'the' error in source title "The Imitation Game" trailer |publisher=The Aperiodical |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=28 July 2014</ref>

Clarke and Turing had been close friends since soon after they met, and continued to be until Turing's death in 1954. They shared many hobbies and had similar personalities.<ref name=bbc/>

=After the war=
After the war, Clarke worked for Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) where she met Lieutenant-Colonel John Kenneth Ronald Murray, a retired army officer who had served in India. They married on 26 July 1952 in Chichester Cathedral. Shortly after their marriage, John Murray retired from GCHQ due to ill health and the couple moved to Crail in Fife.<ref name="BNSobit"/> They returned to work at GCHQ in 1962 where Clarke remained until 1977 when she retired aged 60.<ref name="LALord">cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Clarke_Joan.html|title=Joan Elisabeth Lowther Clarke Murray|work=Honours project|publisher=University of St Andrews|last=Lord|first=Lynsey Ann|year=2008|accessdate=5 November 2013</ref><ref>cite journal|url=http://www.britnumsoc.org/publications/Digital%20BNJ/pdfs/1986_BNJ_56_13.pdf|title=Obituary: Lieutenant-Colonel J.K.R.

Following her husband's death in 1986, Clarke moved to Headington, Oxfordshire, where she continued her research into Numismatics|coinage. During the 1980s, she assisted Harry Hinsley|Sir Harry Hinsley with the appendix to volume 3, part 2 of ''History of the Second World War#Intelligence|British Intelligence in the Second World War''.<ref name="ODNB ref"/> She also assisted historians studying war-time code breaking at Bletchley Park. Due to continuing secrecy among cryptanalysts, the full extent of her accomplishments remains unknown.<ref name="LALord"/>

=Numismatic interest=
After meeting her husband, who had published work on the Scottish coinage of the 16th and 17th centuries, Clarke developed an interest in numismatic history.<ref name=":0"/> She established the sequence of the complex series of Unicorn (coin)|gold unicorn and heavy groat (coin)|groat coins that were in circulation Scottish coinage|in Scotland during the reigns of James III of Scotland|James III and James IV of Scotland|James IV.

Issue No. 405 of the ''Numismatic Circular'' described her paper on the topic as "magisterial."<ref name="ODNB ref"/><ref>cite web|url=http://www.britnumsoc.org/mpandf/sanfordsaltus.shtml|title=Sanford Saltus Gold Medal|year=2013|website=British Numismatic Society|publisher=British Numismatic Society|accessdate=14 November 2014</ref>

Personal life
Little is known about Clarke's personal interests or about her past. According to Kerry Howard, a researcher of the history of female World War II, Joan Clarke was a very private person. One of her neighbours said that she never talked about her personal background, and was quite awkward in social situations.citation needed|date=October 2018 What is known is that throughout her life, Clarke had a number of hobbies that became her passions, such as Botany|botanical work, chess, and knitting.<ref name="bbc">cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29840653|title=Joan Clarke, woman who cracked Enigma cyphers with Alan Turing|publisher = BBC News</ref>

In the spring of 1941, Joan Clarke developed a close friendship with Alan Turing, her colleague from Hut 8. Turing and Clarke had met previously since Turing was friends with Clarke's older brother. For a time they were inseparable. Turing scheduled his shifts so that they worked and spent their free time together. Early in the friendship, Turing proposed marriage to Clarke and she accepted. A few days after the proposal, however, Turing told Clarke about his homosexuality and his concern about their marriage. Clarke and Turing remained engaged. In the late summer of 1941, their engagement ended because Turing continued to believe their marriage would be a failure.

Later, in 1947 Clarke met Lieutenant Colonel John Kenneth Ronald Murray, a retired army officer who had served in India. Clarke and Murray were married on July 26, 1952 in the Chichester Cathedral.

Death
On 4 September 1996, Clarke died at her home in Headington.<ref name="LALord"/>

Portrayal in adaptation
Clarke was portrayed by Keira Knightley in the film ''The Imitation Game'' (2014), opposite Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29840653 "Joan Clarke played by Keira Knightley in upcoming film"], BBC.

However, in contrast, an article by BBC journalist Joe Miller stated that Clarke's "story has been immortalised." In terms of the film itself, director Morten Tyldum has argued that it shows how Clarke succeeded in her field despite working in a time "when intelligence wasn't really appreciated in women."<ref name=bbc/>

Knightley was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 87th Academy Awards for her performance as Clarke.
