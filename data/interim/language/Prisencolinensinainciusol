"Prisencolinensinainciusol" (IPA-it|ˌprizeŋˌkɔliˌnɛnsinainˈtʃuːzol|pron; referred to on the single cover as "Prisencólinensináinciúsol") is a song composed by Italian singer Adriano Celentano, and performed by Celentano and his wife, singer/actress-turned-record producer Claudia Mori. It was released as a single in 1972, and a popular performance of the song was broadcast on RAI.

Language
The song is intended to sound to its Italian audience as if it is sung in English spoken with an General American|American accent, vaguely reminiscent of Bob Dylan,  but the lyrics are deliberately unintelligible gibberish with the exception of the words "all right".<ref>cite book | last = Kroes | first = Rob | title = Cultural Transmissions and Receptions: American Mass Culture in Europe | publisher = Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center | location = Austin Tex. | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-90-5383-207-3 | page=147 </ref> Celentano's intention with the song was not to create a humorous novelty song but to explore communications barriers. "Ever since I started singing, I was very influenced by American popular music|American music and everything Americans did. So at a certain point, because I like American slang—which, for a singer, is much easier to sing than Italian—I thought that I would write a song which would only have as its theme the inability to communicate. And to do this, I had to write a song where the lyrics didn't mean anything."<ref>cite news|last1=Raz|first1=Guy|title=It's Gibberish, But Italian Pop Song Still Means Something|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=164206468|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=All Things Considered|agency=NPR|date=4 November 2012</ref>

In this case, Celentano exemplifies the linguistic concept of glossolalia. This is the phenomenon where someone uses a foreign language which they normally cannot speak. He uses sounds borrowed from American English, which form no words at all, and therefore have no discernible meaning.

Releases and versions
The original version of the track was released as a single on 3 November 1972, and appeared on Celentano's album ''Nostalrock'' the following year. The song appeared on the 2008 dance compilation album ''Poplife Presents: Poplife Sucks''.<ref name="allmusic">cite web|url=Allmusic|class=album|id=r1415649/review|pure_url=yes|title=Review ''Poplife Presents: Poplife Sucks''|last=Anderson|first=Rick |publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=8 January 2010</ref> Celentano later recorded a version with real Italian lyrics; this version, released on his 1994 album ''Quel Punto'', was named "Il Seme del Rap" and served as a hip hop parody. In 2016, Celentano released a new recording of the song (with the original lyrics); this version featured the music of Benny Benassi and vocals from Mina (singer)|Mina.

Celentano performed the song at least twice on Italian television. In one broadcast, he dances with Raffaella Carrà, who lip-synchs to Mori's vocals. In a second broadcast, the song appears in a comedy sketch in which he portrays a teacher. Video clips of both performances, both separate and edited together, began to appear on YouTube in the late 2000s. It became something of an Internet meme,<ref>[http://daily.wired.it/news/internet/celentano-conquista-i-blogger-americani.html ''Celentano conquista i blogger americani''].
