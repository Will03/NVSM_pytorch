Speech-Language Pathology is a field of expertise practiced by a clinician known as a speech-language pathologist (SLP), also sometimes referred to as a speech and language therapist <ref>Cite journal|last=Brady|first=Marian C.|last2=Kelly|first2=Helen|last3=Godwin|first3=Jon|last4=Enderby|first4=Pam|last5=Campbell|first5=Pauline|date=2016-06-01|title=Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD000425|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000425.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27245310|via=</ref> or a speech therapist. SLP is considered a "related health profession" or "allied health profession" along with audiology, optometry, occupational therapy, Psychologist|clinical psychology, physical therapy, and others. The field of SLP is distinguished from other "related health professions" as SLPs are legally permitted to engage in certain disorders which fall within their scope of practice. 

SLPs specialize in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of communication disorders (Speech disorder|speech disorders and Language disorder|language disorders), cognitive-communication disorders, voice disorders, and dysphagia|swallowing disorders. SLPs also play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorder (often in a team with pediatricians and psychologists).

A common misconception is that speech-language pathology is restricted to adjusting a speaker's speech sound articulation to meet the expected normal pronunciation, such as helping English speaking individuals enunciate the traditionally difficult "r". SLPs can also often help people who stutter to speak more fluently. Articulation and fluency however are only two facets of the work of an SLP. In fact, speech-language pathology is concerned with a broad scope of speech, language, swallowing, and voice issues involved in communication,<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/policy/SP2016-00343/#Service_Delivery_Areas|title=Scope of practice in speech-language pathology [Service Delivery Areas]|last=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|date=2016|website=www.asha.org/policy|publisher=|access-date=September 10, 2016</ref> some of which include:

* Word-finding and other semantic issues, either as a result of a specific language impairment (SLI) such as a language delay or as a secondary characteristic of a more general issue such as dementia.
* Social communication difficulties involving how people communicate or interact with others (pragmatics).
* Structural language impairments, including difficulties creating sentences that are grammatical (syntax) and modifying word meaning (morphology).
* Literacy impairments (reading and writing) related to the letter-to-sound relationship (phonics), the word-to-meaning relationship (semantics), and understanding the ideas presented in a text (reading comprehension).
* Voice difficulties, such as a raspy voice, a voice that is too soft, or other voice difficulties that negatively impact a person's social or professional performance.
* Cognitive impairments (''e.g.'', attention, memory, executive function) to the extent that they interfere with communication.

The components of speech communication|speech production include:
* phonation (producing sound)
* resonance
* fluency
* Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation
* pitch (music)|Pitch variance;
* Human voice|Voice (including aeromechanics|aeromechanical components of Respiration (physiology)|respiration)
The components of language include:
* Phonology (manipulating sound according to the rules of a language);
* Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology (understanding components of words and how they can modify meaning);
* Syntax (constructing sentences according to the grammar|grammatical rules of a target language);
* Semantics (interpreting signs or symbols of communication such as words or signs to construct meaning);
* Pragmatics (social aspects of communication).<ref>citation | first = Frances K. | last = Block | author2 = Amie Amiot|author3= Cheryl Deconde Johnson|author4= Gina E. Nimmo|author5= Peggy G.

Swallowing disorders include difficulties in any system of the swallowing process (''i.e.'' oral, pharyngeal, esophageal), as well as functional dysphagia and feeding disorders. Swallowing disorders can occur at any age and can stem from multiple causes.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/policy/SP2016-00343/|title=Scope of Practice in Speech-Language Pathology|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=September 21, 2016</ref>

The profession
Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) provide a wide range of services, mainly on an individual basis, but also as support for individuals, families, support groups, and providing information for the general public. SLPs work to prevent, assess, diagnose, and treat speech, language, social communication, cognitive-communication, and swallowing disorders in children and adults.<ref>cite web|title=Speech-Language Pathologists|url=http://www.asha.org/Students/Speech-Language-Pathologists/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|accessdate=6 April 2015</ref> Speech services begin with initial screening for communication and swallowing disorders and continue with assessment and diagnosis, consultation for the provision of advice regarding management, intervention, and treatment, and providing counseling and other follow up services for these disorders. Services are provided in the following areas:
* cognitive aspects of communication (''e.g.'', attention, memory, problem-solving, executive functions).
* speech (phonation, Manner of articulation|articulation, fluency, resonance, and human voice|voice including aeromechanical components of respiration);
* language (phonology, morphology (linguistics)|morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatic/social aspects of communication) including comprehension and expression in oral, written, graphic, and manual modalities; language processing; preliteracy and language-based literacy skills, phonological awareness.
* swallowing or other upper aerodigestive functions such as infant feeding and aeromechanical events (evaluation of esophageal function is for the purpose of referral to medical professionals);
* voice (hoarseness (dysphonia), poor vocal volume (hypophonia), abnormal (''e.g.'' rough, breathy, strained) vocal quality. Research demonstrates voice therapy to be especially helpful with certain patient populations; individuals with Parkinson's Disease often develop voice issues as a result of their disease.<ref>cite book|last1=Factor|first1=Stewart|last2=Weiner|first2=William|title=Parkinson's disease: Diagnosis & clinical management : Second edition|date=2008|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|location=U.S.|isbn=9781933864006|pages=77–83|edition=2nd, rev. and updat;2; ed.).</ref>
* sensory awareness related to communication, swallowing, or other upper aerodigestive functions.

For example, the treatment for patients with cleft lip and palate, often requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Speech-language pathologists can be very beneficial to help resolve speech problems associated with cleft lip and palate. Research has indicated that children who receive early language intervention are less likely to develop compensatory error patterns later in life, although speech therapy outcomes are usually better when surgical treatment is performed earlier.<ref name="revistaOMF">

=Research=
SLPs conduct research related to communication sciences and disorders, swallowing disorders, or other upper aerodigestive functions.

=Education and training=
United States
In the United States, speech-language pathology is a Master's entry-level professional degree field. Clinicians must hold a master's degree in Communicative Disorders/Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' M.A., M.S., or M.Ed.) that is from a university that holds regional accreditation and from a communication sciences and disorders program that is accredited by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), the profession's national governing body as well as individual state's governing board. Programs that offer the M.Ed. degree are often housed within a university's College of education, but offer the same education and training as programs with a M.A. or M.S. degree. Beyond the master's degree, some SLPs may choose to earn a clinical doctorate in Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' CScD or SLPD), or a doctoral degree that has a research and/or professional focus (''e.g.'', Ph.D., or Ed.D.). All degrees must be from a university that holds regional accreditation, but only the master's degree is accredited by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA).

All clinicians are required to complete 400 clinical hours (25 observation hours often completed during the undergraduate degree and 375 hours of graduate Clinical Practicum).<ref>cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation-Standards-Graduate-Programs.pdf | title=Standards for Accreditation of Graduate Education Programs in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology | publisher=CAA | date=January 1, 2008 | accessdate=August 16, 2016</ref>  They must pass multiple comprehensive exams also called Knowledge and Skills Acquisition (KASA) exams.

After all the above requirements have been met during the SLP's path to earning the graduate degree, SLPs must state licensure and national certification by:
* Passing the National Speech-Language Pathology board exam (Praxis).
* Successfully complete a clinical fellowship year (CFY) as a clinical fellow (CF) under the mentorship of a fully licensed mentor clinician. The CFY is no less than 36 weeks of full-time experience, totaling a minimum of 1260 hours. During the CFY, the CF cannot earn CFY hours unless they work more than 5 hours in a week and cannot earn any CFY hours beyond 35 hours in a week.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/certification/Clinical-Fellowship.htm|title=Speech-Language Pathology Clinical Fellowship|website=www.asha.org</ref>
* Receive American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) and full state licensure to practice, following successful completion of clinical fellowship year(CFY).
* States are responsible for licensure of clinicians and other professionals and, as far as the new SLP, these requirements are often similar to that of the CFY. Following the state licensure procedures and national certification requirements are usually done simultaneously.

Maintaining licensure through continuing education:
* To maintain licensure, SLPs are required to participate in periodic earning of Continuing Educational Units (CEU).

Continuing education and training obligations:
* Educate, supervise, and mentor future SLPs.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.cplol.eu/eng/profil_professionnel.html |title=Professional Profile of the Speech and Language Therapist |website= |accessdate=</ref>
* Participate in continuing education.
* Educate and provide in-service training to families, caregivers, and other professionals.
* Train, supervise, and manage speech-language pathology assistants (SLPA) and other support personnel.
* Educating and counseling individuals, families, co-workers, educators, and other persons in the community regarding acceptance, adaptation, and decisions about communication and swallowing.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/PI2010-00317.html |title=Roles and Responsibilities of Speech-Language Pathologists in Schools |website= |accessdate=</ref>

Professional suffix:
* Credentials of a clinical fellow typically read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CF-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CF-SLP).
* Credentials of a fully licensed SLP commonly read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CCC-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CCC-SLP), indicating a practitioner's graduate degree and successful completion of the fellowship year/board exams to obtain the "three Cs" the Certification of Clinical Competence, in speech-language pathology.

=Salary information=
Salaries of SLPs depend on a variety of factors including educational background, work experience, and location. The ASHA 2016 Schools Survey revealed that SLPs received a median academic year salary of 62,000, which is a 2% increase from the latest Schools Survey done in 2014.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2016-Schools-Survey-SLP-Salary-Trends.pdf|title= Schools Survey Report: SLP Annual Salary and Hourly Wage Trends 2004–2016 |website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association</ref> Additionally, ASHA released results for the 2015 SLP Health Care Survey which placed the median salary for SLPs working within the health care industry at $75,000.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2015-SLP-Health-Care-Survey-Annual-Salaries.pdf|title=SLP Health Care Survey 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=</ref> However, salaries can range from $47,000–116,000.<ref>cite web |url= https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/speech-language-pathologist/salary |title= Speech-Language Pathologist Salary |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= www.usnews.com |publisher= U.S. News |access-date= 8 March 2018 |quote=Speech-language pathologists have seen a spike in pay the past few years.

Methods of assessment
For many parents, the decision of whether or not to enroll students into school-based speech therapy or privately practiced therapy is challenging. Speech Pathologists work as part of a team alongside teachers, counselors, social workers and parents when in a school setting.<ref>Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/speech-language-hearing/speech-language-pathologist/|title=Speech-Language Pathologist ! explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03</ref> Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, students are more likely to qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.  details|Speech and language assessment

If not, private therapy is readily available through personal lessons with a qualified Speech-Language Pathologist or the growing field of telepractice.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.asha.org/telepractice/|title=Telepractice for SLPs and Audiologists|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|accessdate=19 December 2018</ref> Teleconferencing tools such as Skype are being used more commonly as a means to access remote locations in private therapy practice, such as in the geographically diverse south island of New Zealand.<ref>cite web|url=https://vocalsaints.co.nz/|title=Speech Therapy Wellington - Vocalsaints LTD|website=Vocalsaints|accessdate=19 December 2018</ref> More at-home or combination treatments have become readily available to address specific types of articulation disorders. The use of mobile applications in speech therapy is also growing as an avenue to bring treatment into the home.

In the UK, children are entitled to an assessment by local NHS Speech and Language Therapy teams, usually after referral by health visitors or education settings, but parents are also entitled to request an assessment directly.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/helping-your-childs-speech/|title=Help your baby learn to talk|date=21 December 2017|website=nhs.uk|accessdate=19 December 2018</ref> If treatment is appropriate, an educational plan will be drawn up. Speech therapists often play a role in multi-disciplinary teams where a child has speech delay or disorder as part of a wider health condition.
