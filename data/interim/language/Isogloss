Image:German dialectal map.PNG|right|thumb|300px|High German subdivides into Upper German (green) and Central German (blue), and is distinguished from Low Franconian and Low German (yellow). The main isoglosses, the Benrath line|Benrath and Speyer lines, are marked in black.

An isogloss, also called a heterogloss (see #Etymology|Etymology below), is the geographic boundary of a certain linguistics|linguistic feature, such as the pronunciation of a vowel, the meaning of a word, or the use of some morphological or syntactic feature. Major dialects are typically demarcated by ''bundles'' of isoglosses, such as the Benrath line that distinguishes High German languages|High German from the other West Germanic languages and the La Spezia–Rimini Line that divides the Northern Italian dialects from Central Italian dialects. However, an ''individual'' isogloss may or may not have any coincidence with a language border. For example, the front-rounding of /y/ cuts across France and Germany, while the /y/ is absent from Italian and Spanish words that are cognates with the /y/-containing French words.

One of the best-known isoglosses is the centum-satem isogloss.

Similar to an isogloss, an isograph is a distinguishing feature of a writing system. Both concepts are also used in historical linguistics.

Examples

=Centum-satem isogloss=
The centum-satem isogloss of the Indo-European language family relates to the different evolution of the dorsal consonants of Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European (PIE). In the standard reconstruction, three series of dorsals are recognised:

{| 
| labialized velar consonant|Labiovelars: || PIE|*kʷ, || PIE|*gʷ, || PIE|*gʷʰ
|- 
| Velars:      || PIE|*k,  || PIE|*g,  || PIE|*gʰ
|- 
| Palatals:    || PIE|*ḱ,  || PIE|*ǵ,  || PIE|*ǵʰ
|}

In some branches (for example Ancient Greek|Greek, Italic languages|Italic and Germanic languages|Germanic), the palatals merged with the velars: PIE PIE|''*keup-'' "tremble (inwardly)" became Latin ''cupiō'' "desire" and PIE|''*ḱm̥tom'' "hundred" became Latin ''centum'' (pronounced [kentum]); but PIE|''*kʷo-'' "interrogative pronoun" became ''quō'' "how? where?". They are known as ''centum'' branches, named after the Latin word for ''hundred''.

In other branches (for example, Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian), the labiovelars merged with the velars: PIE PIE|''*keup-'' became Vedic Sanskrit ''kopáyati'' "shaken" and PIE|''*kʷo-'' became Avestan ''kō'' "who?"; but PIE|''*ḱm̥tom'' became Avestan ''satəm''. They are known as ''satem'' branches, after the Avestan word for ''hundred''.<ref>cite book|last=Fortson IV|first=Benjamin W.|title=Indo-European Language and Culture|pages=52–54|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2004|isbn=1-4051-0316-7</ref><ref>cite book|title=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben|last=Rix|first=Helmut|authorlink=Helmut Rix|page=359|publisher=Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag|year=2001|isbn=3-89500-219-4</ref>

Since the Balto-Slavic family, the Indo-Iranian family, and the other ''satem'' families are spoken in adjacent geographic regions, they can be grouped by an isogloss: a geographic line separating ''satem'' branches on one side from ''centum'' branches on the other.

=North-Midland isogloss (American English)=
A major isogloss in American English has been identified as the Inland Northern American English|North-North Midland English|Midland isogloss, which demarcates numerous linguistic features, including the Northern Cities vowel shift: regions north of the line (including Western New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Lower Peninsula of Michigan|lower Michigan; northern Illinois; and eastern Wisconsin) have the shift, while regions south of the line (including Pennsylvania, central and southern Ohio, and most of Indiana) do not.

=Northwest Semitic=
Expert-subject|Linguistics|section|date=December 2009
A feature of the ancient Northwest Semitic languages is ''w'' becoming ''y'' at the beginning of a word. Thus, in Proto-Semitic and subsequent non-Northwest Semitic languages and dialects, the Semitic root|root letters for a word for "child" were ''w-l-d''. However, in the ancient Northwest Semitic languages, the word was ''y-l-d'', with ''w-'' > ''y-''.

Similarly, Proto-Semitic ''ā'' becomes ''ō'' in the Canaanite dialects of Northwest Semitic.<ref>cite book|last=Garr|first=W. Randall|title=Dialect Geography of Syria-Palestine: 1000-586 BCE|publisher=Eisenbrauns|date=2 June 2008|isbn=1-57506-091-4</ref> Within the Aramaic languages and dialects of Northwest Semitic, the historic ''ā'' is preserved. Thus, an ancient Northwest Semitic language whose historic ''ā'' became ''ō'' can be classed as part of the Canaanite branch of Northwest Semitic.

Such features can be used as data of fundamental importance for the purposes of linguistic classification.

Isographs
Just as there are distinguishing features of related languages, there are also distinguishing features of related scripts. (For a discussion of writing systems, see ''The World's Writing Systems''.<ref>cite book|editor1-last=Daniels|editor1-first=Peter|editor2-last=Bright|editor2-first=William|title=The World's Writing Systems|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=8 February 1996|isbn=0-19-507993-0</ref>)

For example, a distinguishing feature of the Iron Age Old Hebrew script is that the letters ''bet'', ''dalet'', ayin'' and ''resh'' do not have an open head, but contemporary Aramaic language|Aramaic has open-headed forms. Similarly, the ''bet'' of Old Hebrew has a distinctive stance (it leans to the right), but the ''bet'' of the Aramaic and Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician scripts series has a different stance (in both, it leans to the left).  

In 2006, Christopher Rollston suggested using the term ''isograph'' to designate a feature of the script that distinguishes it from a related script series, such as a feature that distinguishes the script of Old Hebrew from Old Aramaic and Phoenician.<ref>cite journal|last=Rollston|first=Christopher A.|title=Scribal Education in Ancient Israel: The Old Hebrew Epigraphic Evidence|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=344|year=2006|pages=47–74</ref>

Etymology
The term ''isogloss'' (Ancient Greek lang|grc|ἴσος ''ísos'' "equal, similar" and lang|grc|γλῶσσα ''glōssa'' "tongue, dialect, language") is inspired by contour lines, or isopleths, such as isobar (meteorology)|isobars. However, the isogloss separates rather than connects points. Consequently, it has been proposed for the term ''heterogloss'' (lang|grc|ἕτερος ''héteros'' "other") to be used instead.<ref>cite book|last=Sihler|first=Andrew L.|authorlink=Andrew Sihler|title=Language History|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia|year=2000|series=Current issues in linguistic theory|volume=191|page=170|isbn=90-272-3698-4</ref>
