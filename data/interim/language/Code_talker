A code talker was a person employed by the military during wartime to utilize a little-known language as a means of secret communication. The term is now usually associated with United States service members during the world wars who used their knowledge of Native Americans in the United States|Native American languages as a basis to transmit coded messages. In particular, there were approximately 400 to 500 Native Americans in the United States Marine Corps whose primary job was to transmit secret Military tactics|tactical messages. Code talkers transmitted messages over military telephone or radio communications nets using formally or informally developed codes built upon their native languages. The code talkers improved the speed of encryption and decryption of communications in front line operations during World War II.

There were two code types used during World War II. Type one codes were formally developed based on the languages of the Comanches, Hopies, Meskwakis, and Navajos. They used words from their languages for each letter of the English alphabet. Messages could be encoded and decoded by using a simple substitution cipher where the ciphertext was the native language word. Type two code was informal and directly translated from English into the native language. If there was no word in the native language to describe a military word, code talkers used descriptive words. For example, the Navajo did not have a word for ''submarine'' so they translated it to ''iron fish''.<ref>Cite web|url=https://americanindian.si.edu/education/codetalkers/html/chapter4.html|title=Code Talking - Native Words Native Warriors|website=americanindian.si.edu|access-date=2019-01-27</ref><ref>Cite web|url=https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/american-indian-code-talkers|title=American Indian Code Talkers|website=The National WWII Museum !

The name ''code talkers'' is strongly associated with bilingual Navajo language|Navajo speakers specially recruited during World War II by the US Marine Corps to serve in their standard communications units of the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|Pacific theater. Code talking, however, was pioneered by the Cherokee and Choctaw peoples during World War I.

Other Native American code talkers were deployed by the United States Army during World War II, including Lakota people|Lakota,<ref>[http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/news/article_9668c6fe-7a8a-11df-ab6b-001cc4c002e0.html "Last Lakota code talker Clarence Wolf Guts dies at 86"], ''Rapid City Journal (Rapid City, SD)'', 18 June 2010.</ref> Meskwaki, Mohawk people|Mohawk<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/mohawk-code-talker-honoured-afn-house-commons-1.4932074 Last WWII Mohawk code talker honoured by Assembly of First Nations, House of Commons] CBC News byJessica Deer· Posted: Dec 04, 2018 5:29 PM ET | Last Updated: December 4.

There were 35 Basque Society of Jesus|Jesuits in Hiroshima, led by Pedro Arrupe. There was a colony of Basque jai alai players in China and the Philippines,  and there were Basque supporters of Falange in Asia. The American Basque code talkers were kept away from these theaters; they were initially used in tests and in transmitting logistic information for Hawaii and Australia.

According to ''Euzko Deya'', on August 1, 1942, Lieutenants Nemesio Aguirre, Fernández Bakaicoa, and Juanana received a Basque-coded message from San Diego for Admiral Chester W.

Johnston, a World War I veteran, was raised on the Navajo Nation|Navajo reservation as the son of a missionary to the Navajo and was one of the few non-Navajo who spoke the language fluently. Many Navajo enlisted shortly after Pearl Harbor and eagerly contributed to the war effort. "What happened to the Navajo were social conflicts", Navajo code talker Albert Smith said. "But this conflict involved Mother Earth being dominated by foreign countries.

Because Navajo has a complex Navajo grammar|grammar, it is not mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible enough with even its closest relatives within the Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene family to provide meaningful information. At the time, it was still an unwritten language, and Johnston believed Navajo could satisfy the military requirement for an undecipherable code. Its syntax and tonal qualities, not to mention dialects, made it unintelligible to anyone without extensive exposure and training. One estimate indicates that at the outbreak of World War II, fewer than 30 non-Navajo could understand the language.<ref>cite web|last=Vogel|first=Clayton|title=Letter to Commandant, USMC|url=http://archive.library.nau.edu/u?/cpa,44718|work=Demonstration in California, 1942|publisher=Northern Arizona University, Cline Library|access-date=July 20, 2011|author2=Johnston, Philip|authorlink2=Philip Johnston (code talker)</ref>

Early in 1942, Johnston met with Major General Clayton B. Vogel, the commanding general of Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, and his staff. Johnston staged tests under simulated combat conditions which demonstrated that Navajo men could encode, transmit, and decode a three-line English message in 20 seconds, versus the 30 minutes required by machines at that time. The idea was accepted and Vogel recommended that the Marines recruit 200 Navajo. The first 29 Navajo recruits attended boot camp in May 1942. This first group created the Navajo code at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton.<ref name="ww2fact">cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/code-talkers.html|title=Navajo Code Talkers: World War II Fact Sheet |publisher= Naval Historical Center |date=1992-09-17 |access-date=March 12, 2014</ref>

The Navajo code was formally developed and modeled on the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet that spelling alphabet|uses agreed-upon English words to represent letters. It was determined that phonetically spelling out all military terms letter by letter into words, while in combat, would be too time-consuming, some Glossary of military abbreviations|terms, List of established military terms|concepts, List of military tactics|tactics, and instruments of modern warfare were given uniquely formal descriptive nomenclatures in Navajo. For example, the word for ''shark'' referred to a destroyer, while ''silver oak leaf'' indicated the rank of lieutenant colonel.<ref name=NYT>cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Margalit|title=Chester Nez, 93, Dies; Navajo Words Washed From Mouth Helped Win War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/us/chester-nez-dies-at-93-his-native-tongue-helped-to-win-a-war-of-words.html0|access-date=August 4, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=June 5, 2014</ref>

A codebook was developed to teach the many relevant words and concepts to new initiates. The text was for classroom purposes only and was never to be taken into the field. The code talkers memorized all these variations and practiced their rapid use under stressful conditions during training. Uninitiated Navajo speakers would have no idea what the code talkers' messages meant; they would hear only truncated and disjointed strings of individual, unrelated nouns and verbs.Citation needed|date=January 2019

The Navajo code talkers were commended for the skill, speed, and accuracy they demonstrated throughout the war.

To ensure a consistent use of code terminologies throughout the Pacific theater, representative code talkers of each of the US Marine Division (military)|divisions met in Hawaii to discuss shortcomings in the code, incorporate new terms into the system, and update their codebooks. These representatives, in turn, trained other code talkers who could not attend the meeting. As the war progressed, additional code words were added and incorporated program-wide.
