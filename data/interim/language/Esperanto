Esperanto (IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|s|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|n|t|oʊ|,_|-|ˈ|r|æ|n|-)<ref>Citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editor=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartmann |editor3=Jane Setter |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=3-12-539683-2 </ref><ref>citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-1-4058-8118-0</ref> is the most widely spoken constructed language|constructed international auxiliary language. L. L. Zamenhof, a History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist, created Esperanto in the late 19th century and published the first book detailing it, ''Unua Libro'', in 1887 under the pseudonym Dr. Esperanto, ''Esperanto'' translating as "one who hopes".<ref>cite web|title=Doktoro Esperanto, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof |url=https://global.britannica.com/biography/L-L-Zamenhof|website=Global Britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc</ref> 

Zamenhof's goal was not only to create an easy and flexible language that would serve as a universal second language to foster peace and international understanding, but also to built a community of speakers, as he had the right insight one can’t have a language without a community of speakers<ref>Deborah Yaffe, [https://paw.princeton.edu/article/language-idealists A language for idealists], Princeton Alumni Weekly, 11 June 2017, retrieved 3 January 2019.</ref>.

His original title for the language was simply the international language (''lingvo internacia''), but early speakers grew fond of the name ''Esperanto'' and began to use it as the name for the language in 1889; the name quickly gained prominence and has been used as an official name ever since.<ref>harvnb|Schor|p=70</ref>

In 1905, Zamenhof published ''Fundamento de Esperanto'' as a definitive guide to the language. Later that year, he organized the first World Esperanto Congress, an ongoing annual conference, in Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. The first congress ratified the Declaration of Boulogne, which established several foundational premises for the Esperanto movement. One of its pronouncements is that ''Fundamento de Esperanto'' is the only obligatory authority over the language. Another is that the Esperanto movement is exclusively a linguistic movement and that no further meaning can ever be ascribed to it. Zamenhof also proposed to the first congress that an independent body of linguistic scholars should steward the future evolution of Esperanto, foreshadowing the founding of the Akademio de Esperanto, in part modeled after the Académie française, which was established soon thereafter. Since 1905, congresses have been held in various countries every year, with the exceptions of years during the World Wars. In 1908, a group of young Esperanto speakers led by Hector Hodler established the Universal Esperanto Association, in order to provide a central organization for the global Esperanto community.

Esperanto grew throughout the 20th century, both as a language and as a linguistic community. Despite speakers facing persecution in regimes such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union under Stalin,<ref name="conciseencyclopedia_nazi">cite book|last=Sutton|first=Geoffrey|title=Concise Encyclopedia of the Original Literature of Esperanto, 1887–2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Z_8CG9g2jIC&pg=PA161 |year=2008 |publisher=Mondial |isbn=978-1-59569-090-6 |quote="Hitler specifically attacked Esperanto as a threat in a speech in Munich (1922) and in ''Mein Kampf'' itself (1925).

</ref> Although no country has adopted Esperanto officially, Esperantujo is the collective name given to places where it is spoken, and the language is widely employed in world travel, correspondence, cultural exchange, conventions, literature, language instruction, television and radio broadcasting.

While many continue to hope for the day that Esperanto becomes officially recognized as the international auxiliary language, an increasing number have stopped focusing on this goal and instead view the Esperanto community as a "stateless diasporic linguistic minority" based on freedom of association, with a culture worthy of preservation based on its own merit.<ref>http://www.esperantio.net/index.php?id=13</ref> Some have also chosen to learn Esperanto due to its purported Propaedeutic value of Esperanto|help in third language acquisition.

 Three goals 
Zamenhof had three goals, as he wrote in ''Unua Libro'':
# "To render the study of the language so easy as to make its acquisition mere play to the learner."<ref>"After half an hour I could speak more Esperanto than Japanese, I had studied during four years in secondary school" – Richard Delamore. In: "Kiel la esperantistoj povas denove avangardi?", ''Kontakto (revuo)|Kontakto'' 277 (2017:1), p. 20, Tutmonda Esperantista Junulara Organizo|TEJO</ref>
# "To enable the learner to make direct use of his knowledge with people of any nationality, whether the language be universally accepted or not; in other words, the language is to be directly a means of international communication."
# "To find some means of overcoming the natural indifference of mankind, and disposing them, in the quickest manner possible, and en masse, to learn and use the proposed language as a living one, and not only in last extremities, and with the key at hand."<ref name="UnuaLibro">L.L.Zamenhof.

File:Unua Libro.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The first Esperanto book by L. L. Zamenhof published in 1887 in the Russian language

Esperanto was created in the late 1870s and early 1880s by L. L. Zamenhof, a History of Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist from Białystok, then part of the Russian Empire, but now part of Poland. According to Zamenhof, he created the language to reduce the "time and labour we spend in learning foreign tongues" and to foster harmony between people from different countries: "Were there but an international language, all translations would be made into it alone&nbsp;... and all nations would be united in a common brotherhood."<ref name="UnuaLibro"/> His feelings and the situation in Białystok may be gleaned from an extract from his letter to Nikolai Borovko:<ref>The letter is quoted in [http://www.u-matthias.de/latino/latin_en.htm Esperanto: The New Latin for the Church and for Ecumenism], by Ulrich Matthias. Translation from Esperanto by Mike Leon and Maire Mullarney</ref>

quote|"The place where I was born and spent my childhood gave direction to all my future struggles. In Białystok the inhabitants were divided into four distinct elements: Russians, Poles, Germans and Jews; each of these spoke their own language and looked on all the others as enemies. In such a town a sensitive nature feels more acutely than elsewhere the misery caused by language division and sees at every step that the diversity of languages is the first, or at least the most influential, basis for the separation of the human family into groups of enemies. I was brought up as an idealist; I was taught that all people were brothers, while outside in the street at every step I felt that there were no people, only Russians, Poles, Germans, Jews and so on. This was always a great torment to my infant mind, although many people may smile at such an 'anguish for the world' in a child. Since at that time I thought that 'grown-ups' were omnipotent, so I often said to myself that when I grew up I would certainly destroy this evil."|L. L. Zamenhof, in a letter to Nikolai Borovko, ca. 1895

quote|"It was invented in 1887 and designed that anyone could learn it in a few short months. Dr. Zamenhof lived on Dzika Street, No.9, which was just around the corner from the street on which we lived. Brother Afrum was so impressed with that idea that he learned Esperanto in a very short time at home from a little book. He then bought many dozens of them and gave them out to relatives, friends, just anyone he could, to support that magnificent idea for he felt that this would be a common bond to promote relationships with fellow men in the world. A group of people had organized and sent letters to the government asking
to change the name of the street where Dr. Zamenhof lived for many years when he invented Esperanto, from Dzika to Zamenhofa. They were told that a petition with a large amount of signatures would be needed. That took time so they organized demonstrations carrying large posters encouraging people to learn the universal language and to sign the petitions... About the same time, in the middle of the block was marching a huge demonstration of people holding posters reading "Learn Esperanto", "Support the Universal language", "Esperanto the language of hope and expectation", "Esperanto the bond for international communication" and so on, and many "Sign the petitions". I will never forget that rich-poor, sad-glad parade and among all these people stood two fiery red tramway cars waiting on their opposite lanes and also a few doroszkas with their horses squeezed in between. Such a sight it was. Later a few blocks were changed from Dzika Street to Dr. Zamenhofa Street and a nice monument was erected there with his name and his invention inscribed on it, to honor his memory. |Autobiography of Tema Kipnis, Jewish refugee from Poland

About his goals Zamenhof wrote that he wants mankind to "learn and use", "en masse", "the proposed language as a living one".<ref name="UnuaLibro"/> The goal for Esperanto to become a general world language was not the only goal of Zamenhof; he also wanted to "enable the learner to make direct use of his knowledge with persons of any nationality, whether the language be universally accepted or not; in other words, the language is to be directly a means of international communication."<ref name="UnuaLibro"/>

After some ten years of development, which Zamenhof spent translating literature into Esperanto as well as writing original prose and verse, the Unua Libro|first book of Esperanto grammar was published in Warsaw on 26 July 1887. The number of speakers grew rapidly over the next few decades, at first primarily in the Russian Empire and Central Europe, then in other parts of Europe, the Americas, China, and Japan. In the early years, speakers of Esperanto kept in contact primarily through correspondence and periodicals, but in 1905 the first World Congress of Esperanto|world congress of Esperanto speakers was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars. Since the Second World War, they have been attended by an average of more than 2000 people and up to 6000 people.

Zamenhof's name for the language was simply lang|eo|Internacia Lingvo ("International Language").<ref>cite web |url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-buch?apm=0&aid=100059&teil=0101&seite=00000001&zoom=2 |title=Dr. Esperanto' International Language |publisher=L.

File:1905-03-ge-frankf-mapo.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Esperanto groups in Europe in 1905
The autonomous territory of Neutral Moresnet, between what is today Belgium and Germany, had a sizable proportion of Esperanto-speakers among its small and multi-ethnic population. There was a proposal to make Esperanto its official language.

However, neither Belgium nor Prussia (now within Germany) had ever surrendered its original claim to it. Around 1900, Germany in particular was taking a more aggressive stance towards the territory and was accused of sabotage and of obstructing the administrative process in order to force the issue. It was the First World War, however, that was the catalyst that brought about the end of neutrality. On 4 August 1914, Germany invaded Belgium, leaving Moresnet at first "an oasis in a desert of destruction".<ref>Musgrave, George Clarke. ''Under Four Flags for France'', 1918, p. 8</ref> In 1915, the territory was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, without international recognition.

After the Great War, a great opportunity seemed to arise for Esperanto when the Iranian delegation to the League of Nations proposed that it be adopted for use in international relations, following a report by Nitobe Inazō, an official delegate of the League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of Esperanto in Prague.<ref>http://www.esperanto.ie/en/zaft/zaft_2.html</ref> Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, Gabriel Hanotaux. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat, effectively wielding his veto power to block the decision. However, two years later, the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula. For this reason, many people see the 1920s as the heyday of the Esperanto movement. Anarchism as a political movement was very supportive during this time of anationalism as well as of the Esperanto language.<ref>lang|eo|"Anarkiistoj estis inter la pioniroj de la disvastigo de Esperanto. En 1905 fondiĝis en Stokholmo la unua anarkiisma Esperanto-grupo. Sekvis multaj aliaj: en Bulgario, Ĉinio kaj aliaj landoj. Anarkiistoj kaj anarki-sindikatistoj, kiuj antaŭ la Unua Mondmilito apartenis al la nombre plej granda grupo inter la proletaj esperantistoj, fondis en 1906 la internacian ligon Paco-Libereco, kiu eldonis la Internacian Socian Revuon. Paco-libereco unuiĝis en 1910 kun alia progresema asocio, Esperantista Laboristaro. La komuna organizaĵo nomiĝis Liberiga Stelo. Ĝis 1914 tiu organizaĵo eldonis multe da revolucia literaturo en Esperanto, interalie ankaŭ anarkiisma. Tial povis evolui en la jaroj antaŭ la Unua Mondmilito ekzemple vigla korespondado inter eŭropaj kaj japanaj anarkiistoj. En 1907 la Internacia Anarkiisma Kongreso en Amsterdamo faris rezolucion pri la afero de internacia lingvo, kaj venis dum la postaj jaroj similaj kongresaj rezolucioj. Esperantistoj, kiuj partoprenis tiujn kongresojn, okupiĝis precipe pri la internaciaj rilatoj de la anarkiistoj."[http://www.nodo50.org/esperanto/anarkiismo.htm "ESPERANTO KAJ ANARKIISMO" by Will Firth]</ref>

Esperanto attracted the suspicion of many states. The situation was especially pronounced in Nazi Germany, Francoist Spain up until the 1950s, and in the Soviet Union from 1937 to 1956.

In Nazi Germany, there was a motivation to forbid Esperanto because Zamenhof was Jewish, and due to the internationalist nature of Esperanto, which was perceived as "Bolshevist".

=Achievement of its creator's goals=

Zamenhof's goal to "enable the learner to make direct use of his knowledge with persons of any nationality, whether the language be universally accepted or not",<ref name="UnuaLibro"/> as he wrote in 1887<!--Russian [http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-buch?apm=0&aid=100078&teil=0203&seite=00000008&zoom=4 German] and other editions 1887; English edition 1889-->, has been achieved, as the language is currently spoken by people living in more than 100 countries.

On the other hand, one common criticism made is that Esperanto has failed to live up to the hopes of its creator, who dreamed of it becoming a universal second language.<ref>Saul Levin, 1993. "Can an Artificial Language Be More than a Hobby? The Linguistic and Sociological Obstacles". In Ian Richmond (ed.) ''Aspects of internationalism: language & culture''.</ref><ref>''The Christian Century'', 1930, 47:846</ref><!-- Is a quotation from 1930, only 43 years after the publication of the first Esperanto book, still a good idea, now, more than 80 years later?  Lu Wunsch-Rolshoven --> In this regard it has to be noted that Zamenhof was well aware that it may take much time, maybe even ''many centuries'', to get this hope into reality. In his speech at the World Esperanto Congress in Cambridge in 1907 he said, "we hope that earlier or later, maybe after many centuries, on a neutral language foundation, understanding one each other, the nations will build&nbsp;... a big family circle."<ref>"(...)

 Linguistic properties 

= Alphabet =
Main article|Esperanto orthography

The Esperanto alphabet is based on the Latin script, using a one-sound-one-letter principle, except for [d͡z]. It includes six Letter (alphabet)|letters with diacritics: ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ (with circumflex), and ŭ (with breve). The alphabet does not include the letters ''q, w, x,'' or ''y'', which are only used when writing unassimilated foreign terms or proper names.

The 28-letter alphabet is:
<span style="font-size:125%;line-height:150%;"><center>lang|eo|a b c ĉ d e f g ĝ h ĥ i j ĵ k l m n o p r s ŝ t u ŭ v z</center></span>

All unaccented letters are pronounced approximately as in the International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA, with the exception of ''c''. Esperanto ''j'' and ''c'' are used in a way familiar to speakers of many European languages, but which is largely unfamiliar to English speakers: ''j'' has a ''y'' sound [j~i̯], as in ''yellow'' and ''boy,'' and ''c'' has a ''ts'' sound [t͡s], as in ''hits'' or the ''zz'' in ''pizza''.<ref>These letters occasionally have these values in English as well, for example the ''j'' in ''hallelujah|hallelujah, Jarlsberg cheese|Jarlsberg,'' or ''Jägermeister|Jägermeister'', and the ''c'' in the name of composer ''Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki'', Czech president ''Václav Havel|Václav Havel'', or the mineral ''letovicite''.</ref> The accented letters are a bit like ''h''-digraphs in English: ''Ĉ'' is pronounced like English ''ch'', and ''ŝ'' like ''sh''. ''Ĝ'' is the ''g'' in ''gem'', ''ĵ'' a ''zh'' sound, as in ''fusion'' or French ''Jacques'', and the rare ''ĥ'' is like the German lang|de|Bach, Scottish Gaelic, Scots and Scottish Standard English ''loch'', or how Scouse people sometimes pronounce the 'k' in ''book'' and 'ck' in ''chicken''.

 Writing diacritics 
Even with the widespread adoption of Unicode, the letters with diacritics (found in the "Latin-Extended A" section of the Unicode Standard) can cause problems with printing and computing, because they are not found on most physical keyboards and are left out of certain fonts.

There are two principal workarounds to this problem, which substitute Digraph (orthography)|digraphs for the accented letters. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, created an "h-convention", which replaces ''ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ,'' and ''ŭ'' with ''ch, gh, hh, jh, sh,'' and ''u,'' respectively. If used in a database, a program in principle could not determine whether to render, for example, ''ch'' as ''c'' followed by ''h'' or as ''ĉ'', and would fail to render, for example, the word lang|eo|wikt:senchava|senchava properly. A more recent "x-convention" has gained ground since the advent of computing. This system replaces each diacritic with an ''x'' (not part of the Esperanto alphabet) after the letter, producing the six digraphs ''cx, gx, hx, jx, sx,'' and ''ux.''

There are computer keyboard layouts that support the Esperanto alphabet, and some systems use software that automatically replaces x- or h-convention digraphs with the corresponding diacritic letters (for example, lang|eo|Amiketo<ref>Amiketo and Tajpi are keyboard layouts which support the Esperanto alphabet for [http://www012.upp.so-net.ne.jp/klivo/amiketo/ Windows], [http://www012.upp.so-net.ne.jp/klivo/amiketo/makamiketo.html Mac OS X], and [http://www012.upp.so-net.ne.jp/klivo/amiketo/linamiketo.html Linux]</ref> for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, lang|eo|Esperanta Klavaro for Windows Phone,<ref>cite web|url=http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/esperanta-klavaro/e2264bb4-b596-4fb2-a5d3-42d007d6b53c|title=Esperanta Klavaro|work=windowsphone.com</ref> and Gboard and AnySoftKeyboard for Android (operating system)|Android).

Criticisms are made of the letters with circumflex diacritics, which some find odd or cumbersome, along with their being invented specifically for Esperanto rather than borrowed from existing languages; as well as being arguably unnecessary, as for example with the use of ''ĥ'' instead of ''x'' and ''ŭ'' instead of ''w''.<ref name="critiche">cite web|url=http://parracomumangi.altervista.org/domande.htm |title=Critiche all'esperanto ed alle altre lingue internazionali |publisher=Parracomumangi.altervista.org |accessdate=2010-12-05</ref>

= Classification =
The phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and semantics are based on the Indo-European languages spoken in Europe. The phoneme|sound inventory is essentially Slavic languages|Slavic, as is much of the semantics, whereas the vocabulary derives primarily from the Romance languages, with a lesser contribution from Germanic languages and minor contributions from Slavic languages and Greek. Pragmatics and other aspects of the language not specified by Zamenhof's original documents were influenced by the native languages of early authors, primarily Russian, Polish, German, and French.

Adjectives can be freely placed before or after the nouns they modify, though placing them before the noun is more common. New words are formed through extensive prefixing and suffixing.

= Grammar =
Main article|Esperanto grammar
Esperanto words are mostly Morphological derivation|derived by stringing together Root (linguistics)|roots, grammatical endings, and at times prefixes and suffixes. This process is regular, so that people can create new words as they speak and be understood. Compound (linguistics)|Compound words are formed with a modifier-first, head (linguistics)|head-final order, as in English (compare "birdsong" and "songbird," and likewise, lang|eo|birdokanto and lang|eo|kantobirdo). Speakers may optionally insert an ''o'' between the words in a compound noun if placing them together directly without the ''o'' would make the resulting word hard to say or understand.

The different Part of speech|parts of speech are marked by their own suffixes: all common nouns end in lang|eo|-o, all adjectives in lang|eo|-a, all derived adverbs in lang|eo|-e, and all verbs end in lang|eo|-s, specifically in one of six Grammatical tense|tense and Grammatical mood|mood suffixes, such as the present tense lang|eo|-as. Nouns and adjectives have two cases: Nominative case|nominative for grammatical subjects and in general, and Accusative case|accusative for direct objects and (after a preposition) to indicate direction of movement.

Grammatical number|Singular nouns used as grammatical subjects end in lang|eo|-o, Grammatical number|plural subject nouns in lang|eo|-oj (pronounced [oi̯] like English "oy"). Singular direct object forms end in lang|eo|-on, and plural direct objects with the combination lang|eo|-ojn ([oi̯n]; rhymes with "coin"): lang|eo|-o- indicates that the word is a noun, lang|eo|-j- indicates the plural, and lang|eo|-n indicates the accusative case|accusative (direct object) case. Adjectives Grammatical number#Adjectives and determiners|agree with their nouns; their endings are singular subject lang|eo|-a ([a]; rhymes with "ha!"), plural subject lang|eo|-aj ([ai̯], pronounced "eye"), singular object lang|eo|-an, and plural object lang|eo|-ajn ([ai̯n]; rhymes with "fine").

The suffix lang|eo|-n, besides indicating the direct object, is used to indicate movement and a few other things as well.

The six verb inflections consist of three tenses and three moods. They are present tense lang|eo|-as, future tense lang|eo|-os, past tense lang|eo|-is, infinitive mood lang|eo|-i, conditional mood lang|eo|-us and jussive mood lang|eo|-u (used for wishes and commands). Verbs are not marked for person or number. Thus, lang|eo|kanti means "to sing", lang|eo|mi kantas means "I sing", lang|eo|vi kantas means "you sing", and lang|eo|ili kantas means "they sing".

Word order is comparatively free. Adjectives may precede or follow nouns; subjects, verbs and objects may occur in any order. However, the article (grammar)|article lang|eo|la "the", demonstratives such as lang|eo|tiu "that" and prepositions (such as lang|eo|ĉe "at") must come before their related nouns. Similarly, the negative lang|eo|ne "not" and Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions such as lang|eo|kaj "and" and lang|eo|ke "that" must precede the phrase or clause that they introduce. In copula (linguistics)|copular (A = B) clauses, word order is just as important as in English: "people are animals" is distinguished from "animals are people".

Gender
main article|Gender reform in Esperanto
Esperanto is frequently accused of being inherently sexism|sexist, because the default form of some nouns is masculine while a derived form is used for the feminine, which is said to retain traces of the male-dominated society of late 19th-century Europe of which Esperanto is a product.<ref>[http://bertilow.com/pmeg/gramatiko/o-vortoj/seksa_signifo.html Bertilo] (in Esperanto)</ref><ref>[http://parracomumangi.altervista.org/Domande.htm] (in Italian)</ref> Some masculine nouns, primarily titles and kin terms, such as ''sinjoro'' "Mr, sir" vs. ''sinjorino'' "Ms, lady" and ''patro'' "father" vs. ''patrino'' "mother". In addition, nouns that denote persons and whose definitions are not explicitly male are often assumed to be male unless explicitly made female, such as ''doktoro,'' a PhD doctor (male or unspecified) versus ''doktorino,'' a female PhD. This is analogous to the situation with the English suffix ''-ess,'' as in the words ''baron/baroness'', ''waiter/waitress'', etc. Esperanto pronouns are similar. As in English, ''li'' "he" may be used generically, whereas ''ŝi'' "she" is always female.<ref>Kalocsay & Waringhien, ''Plena analiza gramatiko'' (1985:73)</ref>

= Phonology =
Main article|Esperanto phonology

Esperanto typically has 22 to 24 consonants depending on the phonemic analysis and individual speaker, five vowels, and two semivowels that combine with the vowels to form six diphthongs. (The consonant IPA|/j/ and semivowel IPA|/i̯/ are both written ''j'', and the uncommon consonant IPA|/dz/ is written with the digraph ''Dz (digraph)|dz'',<ref>Kalocsay & Waringhien (1985) lang|eo|Plena analiza gramatiko de Esperanto, §&nbsp;17, 22</ref> which is the only consonant that doesn't have its own letter.) tone (linguistics)|Tone is not used to distinguish meanings of words. Stress (linguistics)|Stress is always on the second-last vowel in fully Esperanto words unless a final vowel lang|eo|o is elided, which occurs mostly in poetry. For example, ''wikteo|familio'' "family" is IPA|[fa.mi.ˈli.o], with the stress on the second ''i'', but when the word is used without the final ''lang|eo|o (lang|eo|famili’),'' the stress remains on the second lang|eo|i: IPA|[fa.mi.ˈli].

The sound IPAslink|r is usually an alveolar trill IPAblink|r, but can also be a uvular trill IPAblink|ʀ<ref>cite web|title=PMEG - Bazaj elparolaj reguloj - Konsonanta variado|url=http://bertilow.com/pmeg/skribo_elparolo/elparolo/bazaj_reguloj.html#i-7fo|website=PMEG</ref>, a Voiced uvular fricative|uvular fricative IPAblink|ʁ<ref>cite web|title=Fundamento de Esperanto - Gramatiko Franca|url=http://www.akademio-de-esperanto.org/fundamento/gramatiko_franca.html|website=Akademio de Esperanto</ref>, and an Alveolar and postalveolar approximants|alveolar approximant IPAblink|ɹ<ref>cite web|title=Fundamento de Esperanto - Gramatiko Angla|url=http://www.akademio-de-esperanto.org/fundamento/gramatiko_angla.html|website=Akademio de Esperanto</ref>. Many other forms such an alveolar tap IPAblink|ɾ are done and accepted in practice. The IPAslink|v is normally pronounced like English ''v,'' but may be pronounced IPAblink|ʋ (between English ''v'' and ''w'') or IPAblink|w, depending on the language background of the speaker. A semivowel IPA|/u̯/ normally occurs only in diphthongs after the vowels IPAslink|a and IPAslink|e̞|e, not as a consonant IPA|/w/. Common, if debated, assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation includes the pronunciation of lang|eo|nk as IPA|[ŋk] and lang|eo|kz as IPA|[ɡz].

A large number of consonant clusters can occur, up to three in initial position (as in ''wikteo|stranga'', "strange") and four in medial position (as in ''wikteo|instrui'', "teach"). Final clusters are uncommon except in foreign names, poetic elision of final ''wikteo|o,'' and a very few basic words such as ''wikteo|cent'' "hundred" and ''wikteo|post'' "after".

 Vowels 
Esperanto has the five vowels found in such languages as <!--Not Italian: Italian has seven vowels.-->Classical Latin, Spanish language|Spanish, Swahili language|Swahili, Modern Hebrew, and Modern Greek.

There are also two semivowels, IPA|/i̯/ and IPA|/u̯/, which combine with the monophthongs to form six falling diphthongs: ''lang|eo|aj, lang|eo|ej, lang|eo|oj, lang|eo|uj, lang|eo|aŭ,'' and lang|eo|eŭ.

Since there are only five vowels, a good deal of variation in pronunciation is tolerated. For instance, ''e'' commonly ranges from IPA|[e] (French lang|fr|é) to IPA|[ɛ] (French lang|fr|è). These details often depend on the speaker's native language. A glottal stop may occur between adjacent vowels in some people's speech, especially when the two vowels are the same, as in ''wikteo|heroo'' "hero" (IPA|[he.ˈro.o] or IPA|[he.ˈro.ʔo]) and ''wikteo|praavo'' "great-grandfather" (IPA|[pra.ˈa.vo] or IPA|[pra.ˈʔa.vo]).

Tiam drako estis simbolo de la supernatura estaĵo. Kaj pli poste, ĝi fariĝis prapatro de la plej altaj regantoj kaj simbolis la absolutan aŭtoritaton de la feŭda imperiestro. La imperiestro pretendis, ke li estas filo de la drako. Ĉiuj liaj vivbezonaĵoj portis la nomon drako kaj estis ornamitaj per diversaj drakofiguroj.

:''In many places in China, there were temples of the dragon-king. During times of drought, people would pray in the temples that the dragon-king would give rain to the human world. At that time the dragon was a symbol of the supernatural creature. Later on, it became the ancestor of the highest rulers and symbolised the absolute authority of a feudal emperor. The emperor claimed to be the son of the dragon. All of his personal possessions carried the name "dragon" and were decorated with various dragon figures. Now dragon decorations can be seen everywhere in China and legends about dragons circulate.''

= Vocabulary =
Main article|Esperanto vocabulary

The core vocabulary of Esperanto was defined by lang|eo|Lingvo internacia, published by Zamenhof in 1887. This book listed 900 roots; these could be expanded into tens of thousands of words using prefixes, suffixes, and compounding. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto dictionary, lang|eo|Universala Vortaro, which had a larger set of roots. The rules of the language allowed speakers to borrow new roots as needed; it was recommended, however, that speakers use most international forms and then derive related meanings from these.

Since then, many words have been borrowed, primarily (but not solely) from the European languages. Not all proposed borrowings become widespread, but many do, especially technical terminology|technical and science|scientific terms. Terms for everyday use, on the other hand, are more likely to be derived from existing roots; lang|eo|komputilo "computer", for instance, is formed from the verb lang|eo|komputi "compute" and the suffix lang|eo|-ilo "tool". Words are also calqued; that is, words acquire new meanings based on usage in other languages. For example, the word lang|eo|muso "mouse" has acquired the meaning of a mouse (computing)|computer mouse from its usage in English. Esperanto speakers often debate about whether a particular borrowing is justified or whether meaning can be expressed by deriving from or extending the meaning of existing words.

Some compounds and formed words in Esperanto are not entirely straightforward; for example, lang|eo|eldoni, literally "give out", means "publish", paralleling the usage of certain European languages (such as German (language)|German). In addition, Esperanto words with the ad hoc suffix -um|the suffix ''-um-'' has no defined meaning; words using the suffix must be learned separately (such as lang|eo|dekstren "to the right" and lang|eo|dekstrumen "clockwise").

There are not many idiomatic or slang words in Esperanto, as these forms of speech tend to make international communication difficult—working against Esperanto's main goal.

Instead of derivations of Esperanto roots, new roots are taken from European languages in the endeavor to create an international language.<ref name="piron1989">lang|eo|La Bona Lingvo, Claude Piron. Vienna: lang|eo|Pro Esperanto, 1989. lang|eo|La lingvo volas eleganti, ne elefanti. "The language wants to be elegant, not elephantine."</ref>

 Education 
Esperanto speakers learn the language through autodidacticism|self-directed study, online tutorials, and correspondence courses taught by volunteers. More recently, free teaching websites, like lang|eo|lernu! and lang|eo|Duolingo, are available.

Esperanto instruction is rarely available at schools, including Propaedeutic value of Esperanto|four primary schools in a pilot project under the supervision of the University of Manchester, and by one count at a few universities.<ref>cite web|url=http://uea.org/agadoj/instruado/pirlot.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120529120733/http://uea.org/agadoj/instruado/pirlot.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-29 |title=Esperanto en universitatoj |publisher=Uea.Org |date=2003-04-17 |accessdate=2010-12-05</ref> However, outside China and Hungary, these mostly involve informal arrangements rather than dedicated departments or state sponsorship.

In the United States, Esperanto is notably offered as a weekly evening course at Stanford_University|Stanford University's Bechtel International Center. Conversational Esperanto, The International Language, is a free drop-in class that is open to Stanford students and the general public on campus during the academic year. <ref>http://www.esperanto.org/stanford/</ref> With administrative permission, Stanford Students can take the class for two credits a quarter through the Linguistics Department. “Even four lessons are enough to get more than just the basics,” the Esperanto at Stanford website reads.

After taking the Esperanto course at their university and becoming fascinated with the language, two Stanford students embarked on a research project travelling around Europe to document the history and usage of Esperanto. They visited formal institutions devoted to Esperanto, including the Esperanto Museum in Vienna, and participated in tours conducted in the language and distributed a survey to major Esperanto organizations. Their research focused on the community of Esperanto speakers with the hope of engaging the Esperanto community and the public at large.<ref>https://news.stanford.edu/2017/03/30/students-explore-esperanto-across-europe/</ref>

Various educators have estimated that Esperanto can be learned in anywhere from one quarter to one twentieth the amount of time required for other languages.<ref>cite web |url=http://esperanto-usa.org/?q=node/77 |title=Is Esperanto four times easier to learn? |publisher=Esperanto-USA |accessdate=2010-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310081949/http://esperanto-usa.org/?q=node%2F77 |archive-date=2013-03-10 |dead-url=bot: unknown</ref> Claude Piron, an Esperanto-Activism|Activist and Chinese–English–Russian–Spanish translator for the United Nations, argued that Esperanto is far more intuitive than many ethnic languages: "Esperanto relies entirely on innate reflexes [and] differs from all other languages in that you can always trust your natural tendency to generalize patterns.nbsp...

In one study,<ref name=Williams_1965>Williams, N. (1965) 'A language teaching experiment', ''Canadian Modern Language Review'' 22.1: 26–28</ref> a group of European secondary school students studied Esperanto for one year, then French for three years, and ended up with a significantly better command of French than a control group, who studied French for all four years.

Countering a common criticism against Esperanto, the statistician Svend Nielsen has found there to be no significant correlation between the number of Esperanto speakers and similarity of a given national mother language to Esperanto. He concludes that Esperanto tends to be more popular in countries that are rich, with widespread Internet access and that tend to contribute more to science and culture. Linguistic diversity within a country was found to have a slight inverse correlation with Esperanto popularity.<ref>cite web|url=https://svendvnielsen.wordpress.com/2017/09/24/explaining-the-density-of-esperanto-speakers-with-language-and-politics/|title=Explaining the density of Esperanto speakers with language and politics|author=Svend Vendelbo Nielsen|publisher=Kalkulinda|date=September 24, 2017|accessdate=October 7, 2017</ref>

 Number of speakers 
An estimate of the number of Esperanto speakers was made by Sidney S. Culbert, a retired psychology professor at the University of Washington and a longtime Esperantist, who tracked down and tested Esperanto speakers in sample areas in dozens of countries over a period of twenty years. Culbert concluded that between one and two million people speak Esperanto at ILR or Foreign Service Level language ability measures|Foreign Service Level 3, "professionally proficient" (able to communicate moderately complex ideas without hesitation, and to follow speeches, radio broadcasts, etc.).<ref name=Culbert>Culbert, Sidney S. [http://www.panix.com/~dwolff/docs/ Three letters about his method for estimating the number of Esperanto speakers], scanned and HTMLized by David Wolff</ref> Culbert's estimate was not made for Esperanto alone, but formed part of his listing of estimates for all languages of more than one million speakers, published annually in the World Almanac and Book of Facts. Culbert's most detailed account of his methodology is found in a 1989 letter to David Wolff.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.panix.com/~dwolff/docs/culbert-methods.html |title=Number of Esperantists (methods) |publisher=Panix.com |accessdate=2010-12-05</ref> Since Culbert never published detailed intermediate results for particular countries and regions, it is difficult to independently gauge the accuracy of his results.

In the Almanac, his estimates for numbers of language speakers were rounded to the nearest million, thus the number for Esperanto speakers is shown as two million. This latter figure appears in ''Ethnologue''. Assuming that this figure is accurate, that means that about 0.03% of the world's population speak the language. Although it is not Zamenhof's goal of a international auxiliary language|universal language, it still represents a level of popularity unmatched by any other constructed language.

Marcus Sikosek (now Ziko van Dijk) has challenged this figure of 1.6 million as exaggerated. He estimated that even if Esperanto speakers were evenly distributed, assuming one million Esperanto speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 in the city of Cologne, Germany|Cologne. Van Dijk finds only 30 fluency|fluent speakers in that city, and similarly smaller-than-expected figures in several other places thought to have a larger-than-average concentration of Esperanto speakers. He also notes that there are a total of about 20,000 members of the various Esperanto organizations (other estimates are higher). Though there are undoubtedly many Esperanto speakers who are not members of any Esperanto organization, he thinks it unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members.<ref name=Sikosek_2003 />

Finnish people|Finnish linguistics|linguist Jouko Lindstedt, an expert on native-born Esperanto speakers, presented the following scheme<ref name=Lindstedt_1996>Lindstedt, Jouko. "Re: lang|eo|Kiom?" (posting). [http://www.helsinki.fi/~jslindst/denask-l.html DENASK-L@helsinki.fi], 22 April 1996.</ref> to show the overall proportions of language capabilities within the Esperanto community:
* 1,000 have Esperanto as their native language.
* 10,000 speak it fluently.
* 100,000 can use it actively.
* One million understand a large amount passively.
* Ten million have studied it to some extent at some time.

In 2017, doctoral student Svend Nielsen estimated around 63,000 Esperanto speakers worldwide, taking into account association memberships, user-generated data from Esperanto websites and census statistics. This number, however, was disputed by statistician Sten Johansson, who questioned the reliability of the source data and highlighted a wide margin of error, the latter point with which Nielsen agrees. Both have stated, however, that this new number is likely more realistic than some earlier projections.<ref name="svend">cite web|url=http://www.liberafolio.org/2017/02/13/nova-takso-60-000-parolas-esperanton/|title=Nova takso: 60.000 parolas Esperanton|trans-title=New estimate: 60.000 speak Esperanto|publisher=Libera Folio|language=Esperanto|date=2017-02-13|accessdate=2017-02-13</ref>

In the absence of Dr. Culbert's detailed sampling data, or any other census data, it is impossible to state the number of speakers with certainty. According to the website of the World Esperanto Association:

Lou Harrison, who incorporated styles and instruments from many world cultures in his music, used Esperanto titles and/or texts in several of his works, most notably lang|eo|La Koro-Sutro (1973). David Gaines (composer)|David Gaines used Esperanto poems as well as an excerpt from a speech by Dr. Zamenhof for his ''Symphony No. One (Esperanto)'' for mezzo-soprano and orchestra (1994–98). He wrote original Esperanto text for his lang|eo|Povas plori mi ne plu (''I Can Cry No Longer'') for unaccompanied SATB choir (1994).

There are also shared traditions, such as Zamenhof Day, and shared behaviour patterns. Esperantists speak primarily in Esperanto at World Esperanto Congress|international Esperanto meetings.

Detractors of Esperanto occasionally criticize it as "having no culture". Proponents, such as Prof. Humphrey Tonkin of the University of Hartford, observe that Esperanto is "culturally neutral by design, as it was intended to be a facilitator between cultures, not to be the carrier of any one national culture". The late Scotland|Scottish Esperanto author William Auld wrote extensively on the subject, arguing that Esperanto is "the expression of a Esperanto as an international language|common human culture, unencumbered by national frontiers.

Main article|Esperanto in popular culture

Esperanto has been used in a number of films and novels. Typically, this is done either to add the exotic flavour of a foreign language without representing any particular ethnicity, or to avoid going to the trouble of inventing a new language. The Charlie Chaplin film ''The Great Dictator'' (1940) showed Warsaw ghetto|Jewish ghetto shop signs in Esperanto. Two full-length feature films have been produced with dialogue entirely in Esperanto: ''lang|eo|Angoroj,'' in 1964, and ''Incubus (1965 film)|Incubus,'' a 1965 B-movie horror film which is also notable for starring William Shatner shortly before he began working on ''Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek''.

A language school teaching "Entrenationo" (representing a satire on Esperanto) is featured in Graham Greene's novel ''The Confidential Agent'', which was made Confidential Agent|into a film starring Charles Boyer and Lauren Bacall (1945). Other amateur productions have been made, such as a dramatization of the novel lang|eo|Gerda Malaperis (Gerda Has Disappeared). In ''Stamboul Train'', Greene used Esperanto as the language on signs at the main train station in Budapest. A number of mainstream films in national languages have used Esperanto in some way.

Esperanto is used as the universal language in the far future of Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison's ''Stainless Steel Rat'' and ''Deathworld'' stories. Poul Anderson's story "High Treason (Anderson story)|High Treason" takes place in a future where Earth became united politically but was still divided into many languages and cultures, and Esperanto became the language of its space armed forces, fighting wars with various extraterrestrial races. Esperanto is said to be the official language of all the peoples of Phillip Jose Farmer's "Riverworld" series.

The opening song to the popular video game ''Final Fantasy XI'', "lang|eo|Memoro de la Ŝtono", was written in Esperanto. It was the first game in the series that was played online, and would have players from both Japan and North America (official European support was added after the North American launch) playing together on the same servers, using an auto-translate tool to communicate. The composer, Nobuo Uematsu, felt that Esperanto was a good language to symbolize worldwide unity.

In the geek fiction novel ''Off to Be the Wizard'', Esperanto is programmed as the language that triggers all of the wizard's spells. A teacher explains that this is because "no one really speaks Esperanto and it's easy to learn".

Esperanto is found in the Image Comics series ''Saga (comics)|Saga'' as the language Blue, spoken by the horned inhabitants of Wreath. It is rendered in blue-colored text. Blue is generally only spoken by inhabitants of Wreath, while most other cultures use a universal language that appears to be simply named "Language." Some Wreath inhabitants use translator rings to communicate with those who don't speak Blue. Magic seems to be activated via the linguistic medium of Blue.

In the television show ''Red Dwarf'', which begins in the late 22nd century, crewman Arnold Rimmer constantly spends his time trying to learn Esperanto and failing, even compared to his bunkmate Dave Lister (Red Dwarf)|Dave Lister who only maintains a casual interest. Additionally many of the signs around the ship ''Red Dwarf ships#Red Dwarf|Red Dwarf'' are written in both English and Esperanto. The novel ''Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers'' states that, although not required, it is widely expected that officers in the Space Corps be fluent in the language, hence Rimmer's interest.

Esperanto is available in the language selection in the video game ''Minecraft''.<ref>[https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft Minecraft - Translation Project on Crowdin]. Crowdin.</ref>

= Goals of the movement =
Zamenhof had three goals, as he wrote already in 1887: to create an easy language, to create a language ready to use "whether the language be universally accepted or not" and to find some means to get many people learn the language.<ref name="UnuaLibro"/> So Zamenhof's intention was not only to create an easy-to-learn language to foster peace and international understanding as a general language, but also to create a language for immediate use by a (small) language community. Esperanto was to serve as an international auxiliary language, that is, as a universal second language, not to replace ethnic languages. This goal was widely shared among Esperanto speakers in the early decades of the movement.Citation needed|date=June 2016 Later, Esperanto speakers began to see the language and the culture that had grown up around it as ends in themselves, even if Esperanto is never adopted by the United Nations or other international organizations.<ref name="EspMov181" />

Esperanto speakers who want to see Esperanto adopted officially or on a large scale worldwide are commonly called lang|eo|Finvenkismo|finvenkistoj, from lang|eo|fina venko, meaning "final victory".<ref name="Feeney1999">cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/405278671.html |title=Esperanto: A surprising 2&nbsp;million speakers worldwide get their words’ worth; from the ‘planned language’ created in the 19th&nbsp;century |work=The Boston Globe |date=1999-05-12 |page=F01 |first=Mark |last=Feeney |author-link=Mark Feeney |issn=0743-1791 |subscription=yes |quote=Esperantists speak of the ''fina&nbsp;venko'', or ‘final&nbsp;victory’. The concept is that eventually every moderately educated person&nbsp;... will know Esperanto enough to&nbsp;... order a cup of coffee&nbsp;...</ref> It has to be noted that there are two kinds of "finvenkismo"–"desubismo" and "desuprismo"; the first aims to spread Esperanto between ordinary people ("desube", from below) aiming to form a steadily growing community of Esperanto speakers. The second aims to act from above ("desupre"), beginning with politicians. Zamenhof considered the first way to have a better perspective, as "for such affairs as ours, governments come with their approval and help usually only, when everything is already completely finished".<ref>"[http://www.steloj.de/esperanto/paroloj/kongr6a.html La celo, por kiu ni laboras, povas esti atingita per du vojoj]: aŭ per laborado de homoj privataj, t.e. de la popolaj amasoj, aŭ per dekreto de la registaroj. Plej kredeble nia afero estos atingita per la vojo unua, ĉar al tia afero, kiel nia, la registaroj venas kun sia sankcio kaj helpo ordinare nur tiam, kiam ĉio estas jam tute preta." L. L. Zamenhof. Speech in Washington. 1910</ref>

Those who focus on the intrinsic value of the language are commonly called lang|eo|Raumism|raŭmistoj, from Rauma, Finland|Rauma, Finland, where a declaration on the short-term improbability of the lang|eo|fina venko and the value of Esperanto culture was made at the International Youth Congress in 1980.<ref name="Silfer1999">cite web |url=http://esperanto-ondo.ru/H-silf55.htm |title=Kion signifas Raŭmismo |work=La Ondo de Esperanto |date=1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020530131146/http://esperanto.org/Ondo/H-silf55.htm |archive-date=2002-05-30 |dead-url=no |first=Giorgio |last=Silfer |language=eo |location=Kaliningrad, Russia |issue=5&nbsp;(55)</ref> However the "Manifesto de Raŭmo" clearly mentions the intention to further spread the language: "We want to spread Esperanto to put into effect its positive values more and more, step by step".<ref>"Ni celas disvastigi Esperanton por pli kaj pli, iom post iom realigi ĝiajn pozitivajn valorojn". [http://www.esperantio.net/index.php?id=10 Manifesto de Raŭmo]</ref>

In 1996 the Prague Manifesto (Esperanto)|Prague Manifesto was adopted at the annual congress of the World Esperanto Association (UEA); it was subscribed by individual participants and later by other Esperanto speakers. More recently, language-learning apps like Duolingo and Amikumu have helped to increase the amount of fluent speakers of Esperanto, and find others in their area to speak the language with.

The flag was approved in 1905 by delegates to the first conference of Esperantists at Boulogne-sur-Mer. A version with an "lang|eo|E" superimposed over the green star is sometimes seen. Other variants include that for Christian Esperantists, with a white Christian cross superimposed upon the green star, and that for Leftists, with Red flag (politics)|the color of the field changed from green to red.<ref>cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/qy-eo.html|title=Flags of Esperanto|publisher=Flagspot.net|accessdate=14 January 2015</ref>

= Politics =
Esperanto has been placed in many proposed political situations. The most popular of these is the Europe–Democracy–Esperanto, which aims to establish Esperanto as the official language of the European Union. Grin's Report, published in 2005 by François Grin, found that the use of English as the lingua franca within the European Union costs billions annually and significantly benefits English-speaking countries financially. The report considered a scenario where Esperanto would be the lingua franca, and found that it would have many advantages, particularly economically speaking, as well as ideologically.

Russian Esperanto writer Nikolai Vladimirovich Nekrasov|Nikolai Nekrasov was arrested during the Great Purge|Stalinist repressions of the late 1930s, accused of being "an organizer and leader of a fascist, espionage, terrorist organization of Esperantists", and executed on 4 October 1938. Another Esperanto writer Vladimir Varankin was executed on 3 October 1938.

= Religion =
Esperanto has served an important role in several religions, such as Oomoto from Japan and the Bahá'í Faith from Iran, and has been encouraged by others, like some Spiritist movements.

 Oomoto 
The Oomoto religion encourages the use of Esperanto among its followers and includes Zamenhof as one of its deified spirits.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.oomoto.or.jp/Esperanto/index-es.html |title=The Oomoto Esperanto portal |publisher=Oomoto.or.jp |accessdate=2010-12-05</ref>

 Bahá'í Faith 
The Bahá'í Faith encourages the Bahá'í Faith and auxiliary language|use of an auxiliary international language. `Abdu'l-Bahá praised the ideal of Esperanto, and there was an affinity between Esperantists and Bahá'ís during the late 19th century and early 20th century.<ref name="BahaiEnc368" /><ref name="B Ency"/>

On February 12, 1913, `Abdu'l-Bahá gave a talk to the Paris Esperanto Society,

<blockquote>Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has invented the Esperanto language. It has all the potential qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice on the part of its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and become a part of the curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread<ref>cite book |last= Esslemont |first= J.E. |authorlink= John Esslemont |year= 1980 |origyear = 1923 |title= Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era |edition= 5th |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn= 0-87743-160-4 |page = 165 |chapter=Universal Language |chapter-url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/o/BNE/bne-135.html |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/je/BNE/ </ref></blockquote>

 Spiritism 
In 1908, Spiritism|spiritist Camilo Chaigneau wrote an article named "Spiritism and Esperanto" in the periodic ''La Vie d'Outre-Tombe'' recommending the use of Esperanto in a "central magazine" for all spiritists and esperantists. Esperanto then became actively promoted by spiritists, at least in Brazil, initially by Ismael Gomes Braga and František Lorenz; the latter is known in Brazil as Francisco Valdomiro Lorenz, and was a pioneer of both spiritist and Esperantist movements in this country.<ref>pt icon [http://www.espirito.org.br/portal/artigos/geae/o-esp-e-o-esperanto.html O Espiritismo e o Esperanto (Spiritism and Esperanto)] Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216040313/http://www.espirito.org.br/portal/artigos/geae/o-esp-e-o-esperanto.html |date=2009-12-16 </ref>

The Brazilian Spiritist Federation publishes Esperanto coursebooks, translations of Spiritist Codification|Spiritism's basic books, and encourages Spiritists to become Esperantists.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.math.uu.se/esperanto/207pardue.pdf#search=%22esperanto%20%2Breligion%22|title=Uma só língua, uma só bandeira, um só pastor: Spiritism and Esperanto in Brazil by David Pardue|format=PDF|publisher=University of Kansas Libraries|accessdate=2006-08-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923050241/http://www.math.uu.se/esperanto/207pardue.pdf#search=%22esperanto%20%2Breligion%22|archivedate=2006-09-23|df=</ref>

 Bible translations 
The first translation of the Bible into Esperanto was a translation of the Tanakh or Old Testament done by L. L. Zamenhof. The translation was reviewed and compared with other languages' translations by a group of British clergy and scholars before its publication at the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1910. In 1926 this was published along with a New Testament translation, in an edition commonly called the "lang|eo|Londona Biblio". In the 1960s, the lang|eo|Internacia Asocio de Bibliistoj kaj Orientalistoj tried to organize a new, ecumenical Esperanto Bible version.<ref>cite web|url=http://home.att.net/~el_sxadaj/kbiblio.htm |title=La Sankta Biblio&nbsp;– "Londona text" |publisher= |accessdate=2006-08-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222215537/http://home.att.net/~el_sxadaj/kbiblio.htm |archivedate=2006-12-22 </ref> Since then, the Dutch Remonstrant pastor Gerrit Berveling has translated the Deuterocanonical or apocryphal books in addition to new translations of the Gospels, some of the New Testament epistles, and some books of the Tanakh or Old Testament. These have been published in various separate booklets, or serialized in lang|eo|Dia Regno, but the Deuterocanonical books have appeared in recent editions of the Londona Biblio.

 Christianity

Christian Esperanto organizations include two that were formed early in the history of Esperanto:
* 1910—The International Union of Catholic Esperantists. Two Roman Catholic popes, Pope John Paul II|John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI, have regularly used Esperanto in their multilingual lang|la|urbi et orbi blessings at Easter and Christmas each year since Easter 1994.<ref>cite web|title=Linguistic Democracy - Christmas 2010, Benedict XVI and Radicals: the use of Esperanto remains to be the only thing in common|url=http://www.eraonlus.org/en/78-era-news/6356/christmas-2010-benedict-xvi-and-radicals-the-use-of-esperanto-remains-to-be-the-only-thing-in-common.html|language=en-gb</ref>
* 1911—The International League of Christian Esperantists.

Individual churches using Esperanto include:
* The Quaker Esperanto Society,<ref>[http://www.noos.ch/kes/index.php?pg=2&lg=en Esperanto Society]</ref> with activities as described in an issue of "The Friend"<ref>cite journal

 Mormonism 
The Book of Mormon has been partially translated into Esperanto, although the translation has not been officially endorsed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<ref>cite web|url=http://pemanoj.blogspot.com/|title=ELEKTITAJ ĈAPITROJ EL LA LIBRO DE MORMON|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2017</ref> There exists a group of Mormon Esperantists who distribute church literature in this language.<ref>[http://poresperantamormonaro.weebly.com/ Por-Esperanta Mormonaro]</ref>

 Islam 
Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran called on Muslims to learn Esperanto and praised its use as a medium for better understanding among peoples of different religious backgrounds. After he suggested that Esperanto replace English as an international ''lingua franca'', it began to be used in the seminaries of Qom. An Esperanto translation of the Qur'an was published by the state shortly thereafter.<ref name="webcom">cite web |url=http://www.webcom.com/~donh/efaq.html |title=Esperanto&nbsp;– Have any governments opposed Esperanto? |publisher=Donald J.

 Modifications 
Main article|Esperantido

Though Esperanto itself has changed little since the publication of lang|eo|Fundamento de Esperanto (''Foundation of Esperanto''), a number of reform projects have been proposed over the years, starting with Reformed Esperanto|Zamenhof's proposals in 1894 and lang|io|Ido (language)|Ido in 1907. Several later constructed languages, such as Universal (Esperantido)|Universal, were based on Esperanto.

In modern times, attempts have been made to eliminate perceived sexism in the language, such as Riism.

 Eponymous entities 
See also|Zamenhof-Esperanto object
There are some geographical and astronomical features named after Esperanto, or after its creator L. L. Zamenhof. These include Esperanto Island in Antarctica,<ref>cite web|url=http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=136818|title=Esperanto Island|publisher=Data.aad.gov.au|accessdate=14 January 2015</ref> and the asteroids 1421 Esperanto and 1462 Zamenhof discovered by Finnish astronomer and Esperantist Yrjö Väisälä.
