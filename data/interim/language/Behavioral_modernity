Behavioral modernity<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ravi_Korisettar/publication/263296077_Early_Human_Behaviour_in_Global_Context/links/02e7e53a7f3375f168000000/Early-Human-Behaviour-in-Global-Context.pdf</ref> is a suite of behavioral and cognitive traits that distinguishes current ''Homo sapiens'' from other anatomically modern humans, Hominini|hominins, and primates. Although often debated, most scholars agree that modern human behavior can be characterized by abstract thinking, planning depth, symbolic behavior (e.g., art, ornamentation), music and dance, exploitation of large Game (hunting)|game, and blade technology, among others.<ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000">cite journal|last1=McBrearty|first1=Sally|last2=Brooks|first2=Allison|date=2000|title=The revolution that wasn't: a new interpretation of the origin of modern human behavior|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=39|pages=453–563|doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0435|pmid=11102266</ref><ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003">cite journal|last1=Henshilwood|first1=Christopher|last2=Marean|first2=Curtis|date=2003|title=The Origin of Modern Human Behavior: Critique of the Models and Their Test Implications|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=44|issue=5|pages=627–651|doi=10.1086/377665</ref> Underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically.

Arising from differences in the archaeological record, a debate continues as to whether anatomically modern humans were behaviorally modern as well. There are many theories on the evolution of behavioral modernity. These generally fall into two camps: gradualist and cognitive approaches. The Later Upper Paleolithic Model refers to the theory that modern human behavior arose through cognitive, genetic changes abruptly around 40,000–50,000 years ago.<ref name="Klein 1995">cite journal |last=Klein |first=Richard |title=Anatomy, behavior, and modern human origins |journal=Journal of World Prehistory |date=1995 |volume=9 |pages=167–198 |doi=10.1007/bf02221838</ref> Other models focus on how modern human behavior may have arisen through gradual steps; the archaeological signatures of such behavior only appearing through demographic or subsistence-based changes.<ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /><ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /><ref name="Marean et al 2007">cite journal|last1=Marean|first1=Curtis|title=Early human use of marine resources and pigment in South Africa during the Middle Pleistocene|journal=Nature|date=2007|volume=449|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1038/nature06204|pages=905–908|pmid=17943129|bibcode=2007Natur.449..905M</ref><ref name="Powell et al 2009">cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Adam|title=Late Pleistocene Demography and the Appearance of Modern Human Behavior|journal=Science|date=2009|volume=324|pages=1298–1301|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1126/science.1170165|bibcode=2009Sci...324.1298P|pmid=19498164</ref><ref name="Premo Kuhn 2010">cite journal|last1=Premo|first1=Luke|last2=Kuhn|first2=Steve|title=Modeling Effects of Local Extinctions on Culture Change and Diversity in the Paleolithic|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2010|volume=5|issue=12|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0015582|pages=e15582|pmid=21179418|pmc=3003693|bibcode=2010PLoSO...515582P</ref>

 Definition 

To classify what traits should be included in modern human behavior, it is necessary to define behaviors that are universal among living human groups. Some examples of these human universals are abstract thought, planning, trade, cooperative labor, body decoration, control and use of fire. Along with these traits, humans possess much reliance on social learning.<ref name="Culture and the Evo Process">cite book|last1=Boyd|first1=Robert|last2=Richerson|first2=Peter|title=Culture and the Evolutionary Process|date=1988|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226069333|edition=2</ref><ref name="Nakahashi 2013">cite journal|last1=Nakahashi|first1=Wataru|title=Evolution of improvement and cumulative culture|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=2013|volume=83|pages=30–38|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2012.11.001</ref> This cumulative cultural change or cultural "ratchet" separates human culture from social learning in animals. As well, a reliance on social learning may be responsible in part for humans' rapid adaptation to many environments outside of Africa.
Since cultural universals are found in all cultures including some of the most isolated indigenous groups, these traits must have evolved or have been invented in Africa prior to the Early expansions of hominins out of Africa|exodus.<ref>cite web|last=Wade |first=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/15/science/early-voices-the-leap-to-language-510769.html |title=leap to language |publisher=New York Times |date=2003-07-15 |accessdate=2009-09-10</ref><ref>cite book| last = Buller | first = David| title = Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature|page=468| publisher = PMIT Press| year = 2005| isbn = 0-262-02579-5</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/history/070618_morocco_beads.html |title=80,000-year-old Beads Shed Light on Early Culture |publisher=Livescience.com |date=2007-06-18 |accessdate=2009-09-10</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/BF/bf02/klein/bf02e3.html |title=three distinct human populations |publisher=Accessexcellence.org |accessdate=2009-09-10</ref>

Archaeologically, a number of empirical traits have been used as indicators of modern human behavior. While these are often debated<ref name="Shea 2011">cite journal|last1=Shea|first1=John|title=Homo sapiens Is as Homo sapiens Was|journal=Current Anthropology|date=2011|volume=52|issue=1|pages=1–35|doi=10.1086/658067</ref> a few are generally agreed upon.

= Critiques =

Several critiques have been placed against the traditional concept of behavioral modernity, both methodologically and philosophically.<ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /><ref name="Shea 2011" /> Shea (2011) outlines a variety of problems with this concept, arguing instead for "behavioral variability", which, according to the author, better describes the archaeological record. The use of trait lists, according to Shea (2011), runs the risk of taphonomic bias, where some sites may yield more artifacts than others despite similar populations; as well, trait lists can be ambiguous in how behaviors may be empirically recognized in the archaeological record.<ref name="Shea 2011" /> Shea (2011) in particular cautions that population pressure, cultural change, or optimality models, like those in human behavioral ecology, might better predict changes in tool types or subsistence strategies than a change from "archaic" to "modern" behavior.<ref name="Shea 2011" /> Some researchers argue that a greater emphasis should be placed on identifying only those artifacts which are unquestionably, or purely, symbolic as a metric for modern human behavior.<ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" />

 Theories and models 
Human timeline

=Late Upper Paleolithic Model or "Revolution"=

The Late Upper Paleolithic Model, or Upper Paleolithic Revolution, refers to the idea that, though anatomically modern humans first appear around 150,000 years ago, they were not cognitively or behaviorally "modern" until around 50,000 years ago, leading to their expansion into Europe and Asia.<ref name="Klein 1995" /><ref name="Hoffecker 2009">cite journal|last1=Hoffecker|first1=John|title=The spread of modern humans in Europe|journal=PNAS|date=2009|volume=106|issue=38|pages=16040–16045|doi=10.1073/pnas.0903446106|pmid=19571003|pmc=2752585|bibcode=2009PNAS..10616040H</ref><ref name="Tattersall 2009">cite journal|last1=Tattersall|first1=Ian|title=Human origins: Out of Africa|journal=PNAS|date=2009|volume=106|issue=38|pages=16018–16021|doi=10.1073/pnas.0903207106|bibcode=2009PNAS..10616018T|pmc=2752574</ref> These authors note that traits used as a metric for behavioral modernity do not appear as a package until around 40–50,000 years ago. Klein (1995) specifically describes evidence of fishing, bone shaped as a tool, hearths, significant artifact diversity, and elaborate graves are all absent before this point.<ref name="Klein 1995" /> Although assemblages before 50,000 years ago show some diversity the only distinctly modern tool assemblages appear in Europe at 48,000.<ref name="Hoffecker 2009" /> According to these authors, art only becomes common beyond this switching point, signifying a change from archaic to modern humans.<ref name="Klein 1995" /> Most researchers argue that a neurological or genetic change, perhaps one enabling complex language, such as FOXP2, caused this revolutionary change in our species.<ref name="Klein 1995" /><ref name="Tattersall 2009" />

=Alternative models=
Contrasted with this view of a spontaneous leap in cognition among ancient humans, some authors like Alison S. Brooks, primarily working in African archaeology, point to the gradual accumulation of "modern" behaviors, starting well before the 50,000 year benchmark of the Upper Paleolithic Revolution models.<ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /><ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /><ref name="Foley Lahr 1997">cite journal|last1=Foley|first1=Robert|last2=Lahr|first2=Marta|title=Mode 3 Technologies and the Evolution of Modern Humans|journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal|date=1997|volume=7|issue=1|pages=3–36|doi=10.1017/s0959774300001451</ref> Howiesons Poort, Blombos, and other South African archaeological sites, for example, show evidence of marine resource acquisition, trade, the making of bone tools, blade and microlith technology, and abstract ornamentation at least by 80,000 years ago.<ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /><ref name="Marean et al 2007"/> Given evidence from Africa and the Middle East, a variety of hypotheses have been put forth to describe an earlier, gradual transition from simple to more complex human behavior. Some authors have pushed back the appearance of fully modern behavior to around 80,000 years ago in order to incorporate the South African data.<ref name="Foley Lahr 1997"/>

Others focus on the slow accumulation of different technologies and behaviors across time. These researchers<ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /><ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /> describe how anatomically modern humans could have been cognitively the same and what we define as behavioral modernity is just the result of thousands of years of cultural adaptation and learning. D'Errico and others have looked at Neanderthal culture, rather than early human behavior exclusively, for clues into behavioral modernity.<ref name="D'Errico 1998" /> Noting that Neanderthal assemblages often portray traits similar to those listed for modern human behavior, researchers stress that the foundations for behavioral modernity may in fact lie deeper in our hominin ancestors.<ref name="D'Errico 2003">cite journal|last1=D'Errico|first1=Francesco|title=The Invisible Frontier A Multiple Species Model for the Origin of Behavioral Modernity|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|date=2003|volume=12|doi=10.1002/evan.10113|pages=188–202</ref> If both modern humans and Neanderthals express abstract art and complex tools then "modern human behavior" cannot be a derived trait for our species. They argue that the original "human revolution" theory reflects a profound Eurocentric bias. Recent archaeological evidence, they argue, proves that humans evolving in Africa some 300,000 or even 400,000 years ago were already becoming cognitively and behaviourally "modern". These features include blade and microlithic technology, bone tools, increased geographic range, specialized hunting, the use of aquatic resources, long distance trade, systematic processing and use of pigment, and art and decoration. These items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the "human revolution" model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time. This suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviours in Africa, and its later export to other regions of the Old World.

Between these extremes is the view – currently supported by archaeologists Chris Henshilwood,<ref>cite journal | last1 = Henshilwood | first1 = C.

The term "revolution" in this context would mean not a sudden mutation but a historical development along the lines of "the industrial revolution" or "the Neolithic revolution".<ref>Mellars, P. A., K. Boyle, O. Bar-Yosef and C. Stringer (eds), 2007. ''Rethinking the Human Revolution: new behavioural and biological perspectives on the origin and dispersal of modern humans.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.</ref> In other words, it was a relatively accelerated process, too rapid for ordinary Darwinian "descent with modification" yet too gradual to be attributed to a single genetic or other sudden event. These archaeologists point in particular to the relatively explosive emergence of ochre crayons and shell necklaces apparently used for cosmetic purposes. These archaeologists see symbolic organisation of human social life as the key transition in modern human evolution. Recently discovered at sites such as Blombos Cave and Pinnacle Point, South Africa, pierced shells, pigments and other striking signs of personal ornamentation have been dated within a time-window of 70,000–160,000 years ago in the African Middle Stone Age, suggesting that the emergence of ''Homo sapiens'' coincided, after all, with the transition to modern cognition and behaviour.<ref>Henshilwood, C. S. and B. Dubreuil 2009. Reading the artifacts: gleaning language skills from the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa. In R. Botha and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp.  41-61.</ref> While viewing the emergence of language as a 'revolutionary' development, this school of thought generally attributes it to cumulative social, cognitive and cultural evolutionary processes as opposed to a single genetic mutation.<ref>Botha, R. and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>

A further view, taken by archaeologists such as Francesco D'Errico<ref>cite journal | last1 = D'Errico | first1 = F | year = 2003 | title = The invisible frontier: a multiple species model for the origin of behavioral modernity | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 188–202 | doi=10.1002/evan.10113</ref> and João Zilhão,<ref>cite journal | last1 = Zilhão | first1 = J | year = 2006 | title = Neandertals and moderns mixed, and it matters | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 183–195 | doi=10.1002/evan.20110</ref> is a multi-species perspective arguing that evidence for symbolic culture in the form of utilised pigments and pierced shells are also found in Neanderthal sites, independently of any "modern" human influence.

Cultural evolutionary models may also shed light on why although evidence of behavioral modernity exists before 50,000 years ago it is not expressed consistently until that point. With small population sizes, human groups would have been affected by demographic and cultural evolutionary forces that may not have allowed for complex cultural traits.<ref name="Powell et al 2009" /><ref name="Premo Kuhn 2010" /><ref name="Culture and the Evo Process" /><ref name="Nakahashi 2013" /> According to some authors<ref name="Powell et al 2009" /> until population density became significantly high, complex traits could not have been maintained effectively. It is worth noting that some genetic evidence supports a dramatic increase in population size before human migration out of Africa.<ref name="Tattersall 2009" /> High local extinction rates within a population also can significantly decrease the amount of diversity in neutral cultural traits, regardless of cognitive ability.<ref name="Premo Kuhn 2010" />

Highly speculatively, bicameral mind theory argues for an additional, and cultural rather than genetic, shift from selfless to self-perceiving forms of human cognition and behavior very late in human history, in the Bronze Age.  This is based on a literary analysis of Bronze Age texts which claims to show the first appearances of the concept of self around this time, replacing the voices of gods as the primary form of recorded human cognition.  This non-mainstream theory is not widely accepted but does receive serious academic interest from time to time.

 Archaeological evidence 

= Africa =
Before the Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa theory was generally accepted, there was no consensus on where the human species evolved and, consequently, where modern human behavior arose. Now, however, African archaeology has become extremely important in discovering the origins of humanity. Since the first Cro-Magnon expansion into Europe around 48,000 years ago is generally accepted as already "modern",<ref name="Hoffecker 2009" /> the question becomes whether behavioral modernity appeared in Africa well before 50,000 years ago, as a late Upper Paleolithic "revolution" which prompted migration out of Africa, or arose outside Africa and diffused back.

A variety of evidence of abstract imagery, widened subsistence strategies, and other "modern" behaviors have been discovered in Africa, especially South and North Africa. The Blombos Cave site in South Africa, for example, is famous for rectangular slabs of ochre engraved with geometric designs. Using multiple dating techniques, the site was confirmed to be around 77,000 years old.<ref name="Henshilwood 2002">cite journal|last1=Henshilwood|first1=Christopher|title=Emergence of Modern Human Behavior: Middle Stone Age Engravings from South Africa|journal=Science|date=2002|volume=295|issue=5558|pages=1278–1280|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1126/science.1067575|pmid=11786608|bibcode=2002Sci...295.1278H</ref> Beads and other personal ornamentation have been found from Morocco which might be as much as 130,000 years old; as well, the Cave of Hearths in South Africa has yielded a number of beads significantly before 50,000 years ago.<ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /> Specialized projectile weapons as well have been found at various sites in Middle Stone Age Africa, including bone and stone arrowheads at South African sites such as Sibudu Cave (along with an early bone needle found at Sibudu) dating approximately 60,000-70,000 years ago<ref>cite journal | last1 = Blackwell | first1 = Lucinda | year = 2008 | title =Middle Stone Age bone tools from the Howiesons Poort layers, Sibudu Cave, South Africa | url = | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume=35 | issue = </ref><ref>cite journal | last1 = Wadley | first1 = Lyn | year = 2008 | title = The Howieson's Poort industry of Sibudu Cave | url = | journal = South African Archaeological Society Goodwin Series | volume = 10 | issue = </ref><ref name="Backwell">Backwell L, d'Errico F, Wadley L.(2008).

In 2008, an ochre processing workshop likely for the production of paints was uncovered dating to ca. 100,000 bc at Blombos Cave, South Africa. Analysis shows that a liquefied pigment-rich mixture was produced and stored in the two abalone shells, and that ochre, bone, charcoal, grindstones and hammer-stones also formed a composite part of the toolkits. Evidence for the complexity of the task includes procuring and combining raw materials from various sources (implying they had a mental template of the process they would follow), possibly using pyrotechnology to facilitate fat extraction from bone, using a probable recipe to produce the compound, and the use of shell containers for mixing and storage for later use.<ref name="Henshilwood et al. 2011">Henshilwood, Christopher S., et al.

Expanding subsistence strategies beyond big-game hunting and the consequential diversity in tool types has been noted as signs of behavioral modernity. A number of South African sites have shown an early reliance on aquatic resources from fish to shellfish. Pinnacle Point, in particular, shows exploitation of marine resources as early as 120,000 years ago, perhaps in response to more arid conditions inland.<ref name="Marean et al 2007" /> Establishing a reliance on predictable shellfish deposits, for example, could reduce mobility and facilitate complex social systems and symbolic behavior. Blombos Cave and Site 440 in Sudan both show evidence of fishing as well. Taphonomic change in fish skeletons from Blombos Cave have been interpreted as capture of live fish, clearly an intentional human behavior.<ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" />

Humans in North Africa (Nazlet Sabaha, Egypt) are known to have dabbled in chert mining, as early as ≈100,000 years ago, for the construction of stone tools.<ref>https://www.promine.com/blog/5-oldest-mines-in-the-world-a-casual-survey</ref><ref name="Records2015">cite book|author=Guinness World Records|title=Guinness World Records 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f896CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA27|date=10 September 2015|publisher=Guinness World Records|isbn=978-1-910561-03-4|page=27</ref>

= Europe =
While traditionally described as evidence for the later Upper Paleolithic Model,<ref name="Klein 1995" /> European archaeology has shown that the issue is more complex. A variety of stone tool technologies are present at the time of human expansion into Europe and show evidence of modern behavior. Despite the problems of conflating specific tools with cultural groups, the Aurignacian tool complex, for example, is generally taken as a purely modern human signature.<ref name="Joris Street 2008">cite journal|last1=Joris|first1=Olaf|last2=Street|first2=Martin|title=At the end of the 14C time scaledthe Middle to Upper Paleolithic record of western Eurasia|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2008|volume=55|pages=782–802|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.04.002|pmid=18930513</ref><ref name="Anikovich 2007">cite journal|last1=Anikovich|first1=M.|title=Early Upper Paleolithic in Eastern Europe and Implications for the Dispersal of Modern Humans|journal=Science|date=2007|volume=315|issue=5809|pages=223–226|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1126/science.1133376|pmid=17218523|bibcode=2007Sci...315..223A</ref> The discovery of "transitional" complexes, like "proto-Aurignacian", have been taken as evidence of human groups progressing through "steps of innovation".<ref name="Joris Street 2008"/> If, as this might suggest, human groups were already migrating into eastern Europe around 40,000 years and only afterward show evidence of behavioral modernity, then either the cognitive change must have diffused back into Africa or was already present before migration.

In light of a growing body of evidence of Neanderthal culture and tool complexes some researchers have put forth a "multiple species model" for behavioral modernity.<ref name="D'Errico 1998" /><ref name="D'Errico 2003" /><ref name="Abadia 2010">cite journal|last1=Abadia|first1=Oscar Moro|last2=Gonzalez Morales|first2=Manuel R.|title=REDEFINING NEANDERTHALS AND ART: AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE MULTIPLE SPECIES MODEL FOR THE ORIGIN OF BEHAVIOURAL MODERNITY|journal=Oxford Journal of Archaeology|date=2010|volume=29|issue=3|pages=229–243|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0092.2010.00346.x</ref> Neanderthals were often cited as being an evolutionary dead-end, apish cousins who were less advanced than their human contemporaries. Personal ornaments were relegated as trinkets or poor imitations compared to the cave art produced by ''H. sapiens''. Despite this, European evidence has shown a variety of personal ornaments and artistic artifacts produced by Neanderthals; for example, the Neanderthal site of Grotte du Renne has produced grooved bear, wolf, and fox incisors, ochre and other symbolic artifacts.<ref name="Abadia 2010" /> Although burials are few and controversial, there has been circumstantial evidence of Neanderthal ritual burials.<ref name="D'Errico 2003" /> There are two options to describe this symbolic behavior among Neanderthals: they copied cultural traits from arriving modern humans or they had their own cultural traditions comparative with behavioral modernity. If they just copied cultural traditions, which is debated by several authors,<ref name="D'Errico 1998" /><ref name="D'Errico 2003" /> they still possessed the capacity for complex culture described by behavioral modernity. As discussed above, if Neanderthals also were "behaviorally modern" then it cannot be a species-specific derived trait.

= Asia =
Most debates surrounding behavioral modernity have been focused on Africa or Europe but an increasing amount of focus has been placed on East Asia. This region offers a unique opportunity to test hypotheses of multi-regionalism, replacement, and demographic effects.<ref name="Norton Jin 2009">cite journal|last1=Norton|first1=Christopher|last2=Jin|first2=Jennie|title=The Evolution of Modern Human Behavior in East Asia: Current Perspectives|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|date=2009|volume=18|pages=247–260|doi=10.1002/evan.20235</ref> Unlike Europe, where initial migration occurred around 50,000 years ago, human remains have been dated in China to around 100,000 years ago.<ref name="Liu et al. 2010">cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Wu|title=Human remains from Zhirendong, South China, and modern human emergence in East Asia|journal=PNAS|date=2010|volume=107|issue=45|pages=19201–19206|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1014386107|pmid=20974952|pmc=2984215|bibcode=2010PNAS..10719201L</ref> This early evidence of human expansion calls into question behavioral modernity as an impetus for migration.

Stone tool technology is particularly of interest in East Asia. Following Homo erectus migrations out of Africa, Acheulean technology never seems to appear beyond present-day India and into China. Analogously, Mode 3, or Levallois technique|Levallois technology, is not apparent in China following later hominin dispersals.<ref name="Norton Bae 2008">cite journal|last1=Norton|first1=Christopher|last2=Bae|first2=K.|title=The Movius Line sensu lato (Norton et al. 2006) further assessed and defined|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2008|volume=55|pages=1148–1150|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.08.003</ref> This lack of more advanced technology has been explained by serial founder effects and low population densities out of Africa.<ref name="Lycett Norton 2010">cite journal|last1=Lycett|first1=Stephen|last2=Norton|first2=Christopher|title=A demographic model for Palaeolithic technological evolution: The case of East Asia and the Movius Line|journal=Quaternary International|date=2010|volume=211|pages=55–65|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2008.12.001|bibcode=2010QuInt.211...55L</ref> Although tool complexes comparative to Europe are missing or fragmentary, other archaeological evidence shows behavioral modernity. For example, the peopling of the Japanese archipelago offers an opportunity to investigate the early use of watercraft. Although one site, Kanedori in Honshu, does suggest the use of watercraft as early as 84,000 years ago, there is no other evidence of hominins in Japan until 50,000 years ago.<ref name="Norton Jin 2009" />

The Zhoukoudian cave system near Beijing has been excavated since the 1930s and has yielded precious data on early human behavior in East Asia. Although disputed, there is evidence of possible human burials and interred remains in the cave dated to around 34-20,000 years ago.<ref name="Norton Jin 2009" /> These remains have associated personal ornaments in the form of beads and worked shell, suggesting symbolic behavior. Along with possible burials, numerous other symbolic objects like punctured animal teeth and beads, some dyed in red ochre, have all been found at Zhoukoudian.<ref name="Norton Jin 2009" /> Although fragmentary, the archaeological record of eastern Asia shows evidence of behavioral modernity before 50,000 years ago but, like the African record, it is not fully apparent until that time.
