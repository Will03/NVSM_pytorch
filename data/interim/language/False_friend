Linguistics

False friends are words in two languages that look or sound similar, but differ significantly in meaning. An example is the English ''embarrassed'' and the Spanish ''embarazada'' (which means ''pregnant''), or the word ''sensible'', which means ''reasonable'' in English, but ''sensitive'' in :wikt:sensible#French|French and :wikt:sensible#Spanish|Spanish. 

The term originates from a book by French linguists describing the phenomenon, which was translated in 1928 and entitled, "false friend of a translator".

As well as producing completely false friends, the use of loanwords often results in the use of a word in a restricted Context (language use)|context, which may then develop new meanings not found in the original language. For example, ''angst'' means "fear" in a general sense (as well as "anxiety") in German, but when it was borrowed into English in the context of psychology, its meaning was restricted to a particular type of fear described as "a neurotic feeling of anxiety and depression".<ref>cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/blvoc_gerloan.htm|title=German Loan Words in English|publisher=About.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28</ref> Also, ''gymnasium'' meant both 'a place of education' and 'a place for exercise' in Latin, but its meaning was restricted to the former in German and to the latter in English, making the expressions into false friends in those languages as well as in Greek, where it started out as 'a place for naked exercise'.<ref>cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=gymnasium|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=etymolyonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28</ref>

The origin of the term is as a shortened version of the expression "false friend of a translator", the English translation of a French expression (lang-fr|faux amis du traducteur) introduced by linguists Maxime Kœssler and Jules Derocquigny in their 1928 book,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0aFqB-R0MrgC&pg=PA698 books.google.com]</ref> ''False Friends, or the Pitfalls of the English Vocabulary'' (''Les Faux Amis ou les trahisons du vocabulaire anglais'')<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lesfauxamisoules00kssl archive.org]</ref> with a sequel, ''Autres Mots anglais perfides''.

 Implications 
Unreferenced|section|date=May 2018
False friends can cause difficulty for people who might interpret a foreign text incorrectly.  Students learning a foreign language, particularly one that is related to their First language|native language, also have difficulty with false friends because students are likely to identify the words wrongly due to language transfer|linguistic interference. For this reason, teachers sometimes compile lists of false friends as an aid for their students.

 Causes 
From the etymology|etymological point of view, false friends can be created in several ways.

= Shared etymology =
If language A borrowed a word from language B, or both borrowed the word from a third language or inherited it from a common ancestor, and later the word shifted in meaning or acquired additional meanings in at least one of these languages, a First language|native speaker of one language will face a false friend when learning the other. Sometimes, presumably both senses were present in the common ancestor language, but the cognate words got different restricted senses in Language A and Language B.citation needed |date=March 2013

''Actual'', which in English is usually a synonym of ''real'', has a different meaning in other European languages, in which it means 'current' or 'up-to-date', and has the logical derivative as a verb, meaning 'to make current' or 'to update'. ''Actualise'' (or 'actualize') in English means 'to make a reality of'.<ref>citation |title=Euro-English: assessing variety status
|last=Mollin |first=Sandra |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPhULmMmqJMC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=using+actual+to+mean+current#v=onepage&q=&f=false</ref>

The word ''friend'' itself has cognates in the other Germanic languages; but the Scandinavian ones (like Swedish ''frände'', Danish ''frænde'') predominantly mean 'relative'. The original Proto-Germanic word meant simply 'someone whom one cares for' and could therefore refer to both a friend and a relative, but lost various degrees of the 'friend' sense in Scandinavian languages, while it mostly lost the sense of 'relative' in English. (The plural ''friends'' is still rarely used for "kinsfolk", as in the Scottish proverb ''Friends agree best at a distance'', quoted in 1721.)

The Estonian language|Estonian and Finnish languages are closely related, which gives rise to false friends:<ref name="Knospe-2016"/>

In Belgium, similarities between Dutch and French words often lead to confusion when several different meanings of the same word are mixed up and thus mistranslated. In satirical sketch comedy ''Sois Belge et tais-toi!'', performed by Joël Riguelle in 2009, the following examples are given:<ref>Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mwIutXeHxE |title=Sois Belge Et Tais-toi 2009 - Derde Les |author=Joël Riguelle |work=Sois Belge Et Tais-toi 2009 |date=2009 |accessdate=28 January 2019 |language=fr</ref>

The Italian word ''confetti'' (sugared almonds) has acquired a new meaning in English, French and Dutch; in Italian, the corresponding word is ''coriandoli''.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/confetto |title=''Confetto in Enciclopedia Treccani'' |publisher=Treccani.it |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23</ref>

English and Spanish, both of which have borrowed from Greek language|Greek and Latin language|Latin, have multiple false friends.citation needed |date=April 2018

English and Japanese also have diverse false friends, many of them being ''wasei-eigo'' and ''gairaigo'' words.<ref>Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Chalmers|date=1980|title=Omote (Explicit) and Ura (Implicit): Translating Japanese Political Terms|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/132001|journal=Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=6|issue=1|pages=89–115|doi=10.2307/132001</ref>

In Swedish, the word ''rolig'' means 'fun': ''ett roligt skämt'' ("a funny joke"), while in the closely related languages Danish and Norwegian it means 'calm' (as in "he was calm despite all the commotion around him"). However, the Swedish original meaning of 'calm' is retained in some related words such as ''ro'', 'calmness', and ''orolig'', 'worrisome, anxious', literally 'un-calm'.<ref>cite encyclopedia |article=Orolig |date=1950 |title=Svenska Akademiens Ordbok |trans-title=The Swedish Academy's Dictionary |publisher=Swedish Academy |location=Lund |page=spalt O 1337 |volume=19 |chapter-url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=orolig|accessdate=8 May 2017|language=Swedish|quote=[fsv. oroliker; jfr dan. o. nor. urolig, nor. dial. uroleg, nyisl. órólegur (jfr isl. úróliga, adv.), mlt. unrouwelik, (ä.) t. unruhlich; av O- 1 o.

The Danish word ''frokost'' means lunch, the Norwegian word ''frokost'' means breakfast.

Main|Pseudo-anglicism

Pseudo-anglicisms are new words formed from English morphemes independently from an analogous English construct and with a different intended meaning.<ref>cite book|last1=Onysko|first1=Alexander|title=Anglicisms in German: Borrowing, Lexical Productivity, and Written Codeswitching|date=2007|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin/New York|isbn=978-3-11-019946-8|pages=52-55</ref>

Japanese language|Japanese is replete with pseudo-anglicisms, known as ''wasei-eigo'' ("Japan-made English").citation needed|date=April 2018

 Semantic change 
In bilingual situations, false friends often result in a semantic change—a real new meaning that is then commonly used in a language. For example, the Portuguese language|Portuguese ''humoroso'' ('capricious') changed its referent in American Portuguese to 'humorous', owing to the English language|English surface-cognate ''humorous.''citation needed|date=March 2013

''Corn'' was originally the dominant type of grain in a region (indeed ''corn'' and ''grain'' are themselves cognates from the same Indo-European root). It came to mean usually cereals in general in the British Isles in the nineteenth century, as in the Corn Laws, but maize in North America, and now often just maize also in the British Isles.citation needed|date=March 2013

The American Italian language|Italian ''fattoria'' lost its original meaning 'farm' in favor of 'factory' owing to the phonetically similar surface-cognate English language|English ''factory'' (cf. Standard Italian language|Italian ''fabbrica'' 'factory'). Instead of the original ''fattoria'', the phonetic adaptation American Italian language|Italian ''farma'' became the new signifier for 'farm' (Weinreich 1963: 49; see "one-to-one correlation between signifiers and referents").

This phenomenon is analyzed by Ghil'ad Zuckermann as "(incestuous) phono-semantic matching".<ref>cite book |page=102 |first= Ghil'ad |last=Zuckermann |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?is=140391723X |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher= Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, (Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change, Series editor: Charles Jones) |ISBN= 1-4039-1723-X</ref>
