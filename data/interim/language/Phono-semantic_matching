Phono-semantic matching (PSM) is the incorporation of a word into one language from another, often creating a neologism, where the word's non-native quality is hidden by replacing it with Phonetics|phonetically and semantically similar words or roots from the adopting language. Thus, the approximate sound and Meaning (linguistic)|meaning of the original expression in the source language are preserved, though the new expression (the PSM) in the target language may sound native.

Phono-semantic matching is distinct from calquing, which includes (semantic) translation but does not include phonetic matching (i.e. retaining the approximate sound of the loanword|borrowed word through matching it with a similar-sounding pre-existent word or morpheme in the target language). At the same time, phono-semantic matching is also distinct from homophonic translation, which retains the sound of a word but not the meaning.

History
The term "phono-semantic matching" was introduced by linguist and revivalist Ghil'ad Zuckermann.sfn|Zuckermann|2003a It challenged Einar Haugen's classic Morphological typology|typology of lexical borrowing (loanwords).sfn|Haugen|1950 While Haugen categorized borrowing into either substitution or importation, camouflaged borrowing in the form of PSM is a case of "simultaneous substitution and importation." Zuckermann proposed a new classification of multisourced neologisms, words deriving from two or more sources at the same time. Examples of such mechanisms are phonetic matching, semanticized phonetic matching and phono-semantic matching.

Zuckermann concludes that language planning|language planners, for example members of the Academy of the Hebrew Language, employ the very same techniques used in folk etymology by laymen, as well as by religious leaders.sfn|Zuckermann|2006 He urges lexicographers and etymologists to recognize the widespread phenomena of camouflaged borrowing and multisourced neologization and not to force one source on multi-parental lexical items.

Examples
=Modern Hebrew=
Often in phono-semantic matching, the source-language determines both the root word and the noun-pattern. This makes it difficult to determine the source language's influence on the target-language morphology (linguistics)|morphology. For example, "the phono-semantic matcher of English language|English ''dock'' with Modern Hebrew|Israeli Hebrew מבדוק ''mivdók'' could have usedsnd after deliberately choosing the phonetically and semantically suitable triliteral root|root ''transl|he|b-d-q'' lang|he|בדק meaning 'check' (Rabbinic) or 'repair' (Biblical)snd the noun-patterns ''mi⌂⌂a⌂á'', ''ma⌂⌂e⌂á'', ''mi⌂⌂é⌂et'', ''mi⌂⌂a⌂áim'' etc. (each ⌂ represents a slot where a radical is inserted). Instead, ''mi⌂⌂ó⌂'', which was not highly productive, was chosen because its [o] makes the final syllable of מבדוק ''mivdók'' sound like English ''dock''."sfn|Zuckermann|2009|page=59

=Mandarin Chinese=
PSM is frequently used in Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin borrowings.sfn|Zuckermann|2003bsfn|Zuckermann|2004

An example is the Taiwanese Mandarin word lang|zh|威而剛 ''wēi'érgāng'' (wei'ergang), which literally means "powerful and hard" and refers to Viagra, the drug for treating impotence in men, manufactured by Pfizer.sfn|Zuckermann|2003a|page= 59

Another example is the Mandarin form of World Wide Web, which is ''wàn wéi wǎng'' (lang|zh|wikt:万维网|万维网), which satisfies "www" and literally means “myriad dimensional net”.<ref>See CEDICT or the [http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=translate&trst=0&trqs=World+Wide+Web&trlang=&wddmtm=0 MDBG Chinese-English Dictionary].</ref> The English word ''hacker (term)|hacker'' has been borrowed into Mandarin as lang|zh|linktext|黑客 (''hēikè'', "wicked visitor").sfn|Gao|2008

"Modern Standard Chinese lang|zh-hans|声纳 ''shēngnà'' "sonar", which uses the characters lang|zh|声 ''shēng'' "sound" and lang|zh|纳 ''nà'' "receive, accept". lang|zh|声 ''shēng'' is a phonetically imperfect rendering of the English initial syllable (although ''peng'', for instance, would have been much worseClarification needed|date=January 2019). Chinese has a large number of homo/heterotonal homophonous morphemes, which would have been much better phonetically (but not nearly as good semantically)snd consider the syllable ''lang|zh-latn-pinyin|song'' (cf. lang|zh|送 ''sòng'' ‘deliver, carry, give (as a present)’, lang|zh|松 ''sōng'' ‘pine; loose, slack’, lang|zh|耸 ''sǒng'' ‘tower; alarm, attract’ etc.), ''lang|zh-latn-pinyin|sou'' (cf. lang|zh|搜 ''sōu'' ‘search’, lang|zh|叟 ''sŏu'' ‘old man’, lang|zh|馊 ''sōu'' ‘sour, spoiled’ and many others) or ''lang|zh-latn-pinyin|shou'' (cf. lang|zh|收 ''shōu'' ‘receive, accept’, lang|zh|受 ''shòu'' ‘receive, accept’, lang|zh|手 ''shǒu'' ‘hand’, lang|zh|首 ''shǒu'' ‘head’, lang|zh|兽 ''shòu'' ‘beast’, lang|zh|瘦 ''shòu'' ‘thin’ and so forth).".sfn|Zuckermann|2003a|page=57

According to Zuckermann, PSM in Mandarin is common in:

* brand names
* computer jargon; the aforementioned word for "World Wide Web"
* technological terms; the aforementioned word for "Sonar".
* toponyms; e.g. The name lang|zh-hans|白俄罗斯 ''Bái'èluósī'', "Belarus" combines the word lang|zh-hans|白 ''Bái'', "White" with the name lang|zh-hans|俄罗斯 ''Èluósī'', "Russia", therefore meaning "White Russia" just like the endonym "Белару́сь".

From a monolingual Chinese view, Mandarin PSM is the ‘lesser evil’ compared with Latin script (in digraphic writing) or code switching (in speech). Zuckermann’s exploration of PSM in Standard Chinese and Meiji-period Japanese language|Japanese concludes that the Written Chinese|Chinese writing system is multifunctional: pleremic ("full" of meaning, e.g. logographic), cenemic ("empty" of Meaning (linguistics)|meaning, e.g. phonographic - like a syllabary) and simultaneously cenemic and pleremic (phono-logographic). Zuckermann argues that Leonard Bloomfield’s assertion that "a language is the same no matter what system of writing may be used"sfn|Bloomfield|1933 is inaccurate. “If Chinese had been written romanization of Chinese|using roman letters, thousands of Chinese words would not have been coined, or would have been coined with completely different forms”.sfn|Zuckermann|2003a|page=255

=Japanese=
Main|Ateji

In modern Japanese, loan words are generally represented phonetically via katakana. However, previously loan words were often represented by Chinese characters, a process called ''ateji'' (when used for sound, or ''jukujikun,'' when used for meaning), and some of these continue to be used. The characters chosen may correspond to the sound, the meaning, or both.

In many cases the characters used were used only for sound or only for meaning. For example, in the word lang|ja-Hani|寿司 (sushi), the two characters are respectively read as ''su'' and ''shi'', but the character lang|ja-Hani|寿 means "one's natural life span" and lang|ja-Hani|司 means "to administer", neither of which has anything to do with the foodsnd this is ''ateji''. Conversely, in the word lang|ja-Hani|煙草 (''tabako'') for "tobacco", the individual kanji respectively mean "smoke" and "herb", which corresponds to the meaning, but they have no phonetic relationship to the word ''tabako''snd this is ''jukujikun''.

In some cases, however, the kanji are sometimes chosen for both their semantic and phonetic values, a form of phono-semantic matching. A stock example is lang|ja-Hani|倶楽部 (''kurabu'') for "Club (organization)|club", where the characters can be interpreted loosely in sequence as "together", "fun" and "place". Another example is lang|ja-Hani|合羽 (''kappa'') for the Portuguese language|Portuguese ''capa'', a kind of raincoat. The characters can mean "wings coming together", as the pointed ''capa'' resembles a bird with wings folded together.

=Icelandic=
harvtxt|Sapir|Zuckermann|2008 demonstrate how Icelandic camouflages many English words by means of phono-semantic matching. For example, the Icelandic-looking word ''eyðni'', meaning "AIDS", is a PSM of the English acronym ''AIDS'', using the pre-existent Icelandic verb ''eyða'', meaning "to destroy", and the Icelandic nominal suffix ''-ni''.<ref>harvtxt|Sapir|Zuckermann|2008|page=36: see also lang|zh-hans|爱滋病 ''lang|zh-latn-pinyin|aìzībìng'' (lit. "a disease caused by (making) love"), another PSM of ''AIDS'', in this case in Modern Standard Chinese.</ref> Similarly, the Icelandic word ''tækni'', meaning "technology, technique", derives from ''tæki'', meaning "tool", combined with the nominal suffix ''-ni'', but is, in fact, a PSM of the Danish (or international) ''teknik'', meaning "technology, technique". ''Tækni'' was coined in 1912 by Dr Björn Bjarnarson from Viðfjörður in the East of Iceland. It had been in little use until the 1940s, but has ever since become highly common, as a lexeme and as an element in new formations, such as ''raftækni'', lit. "electrical technics", i.e. "electronics", ''tæknilegur'' "technical" and ''tæknir'' "technician".<ref>harvtxt|Sapir|Zuckermann|2008|pages=37–38, cf. lang|ar|تقنيّ taqni/tiqani (lit. "of perfection, related to mastering and improving"), another PSM of  ''technical'', in this case in Modern Arabic.</ref> Other PSMs discussed in the article are ''beygla'', ''bifra''snd ''bifrari'', ''brokkál'', ''dapur''snd ''dapurleiki'' - ''depurð'', ''fjárfesta'' - ''fjárfesting'', ''heila'', ''guðspjall'', ''ímynd'', ''júgurð'', ''korréttur'', ''Létt og laggott'', ''musl'', ''pallborð''snd ''pallborðsumræður'', ''páfagaukur'', ''ratsjá'', ''setur'', ''staða'', ''staðall''snd ''staðla''snd ''stöðlun'', ''toga''snd ''togari'', ''uppi'' and ''veira''.sfn|Sapir|Zuckermann|2008

=English=
In the vegetable name Jerusalem artichoke the first word part was altered to match ''Jerusalem'' exactly, although it actually derives from Italian ''girasole'' 'sunflower'.

A few PSMs exist in English, based on French loanwords; the mispronunciation of ''lang|fr|chaise longue'' as "chase-''lounge''" is a familiar example.  The French word ''lang|fr|choupique'', itself an adaptation of the Choctaw name for the bowfin, has likewise been Anglicized as "shoepike",<ref>cite web |url=http://www.bowfinanglers.com/ |title=Bowfin Anglers |accessdate=2007-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712154743/http://www.bowfinanglers.com/ |archivedate=2007-07-12 |df= </ref> although it is unrelated to the Esox|pikes.  The French name for the Maclura pomifera|Osage orange, ''lang|fr|bois d'arc'' (abbr|lit.|literally "Bow (weapon)|bow-wood"), is sometimes rendered as "bowdark".sfn|Wynia|2011 

The second part of the word ''muskrat'' was altered to match ''rat'', replacing the original form ''linktext|musquash'', which derives from an Algonquian languages|Algonquian (possibly Powhatan language|Powhatan<ref>cite web|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|title=Muskrat|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=muskrat</ref>) word, ''muscascus'' (literally "it is red"), or from the Abenaki language|Abenaki native word ''mòskwas''.

=Dutch=
A number of PSMs exist in Dutch language|Dutch as well. One notable example is ''hangmat'' ("hammock"), which is a modification of Spanish ''hamaca'', also the source of the English word. Natively, the word is transparently analysed as a "hang-mat", which aptly describes the object. Similarly:
* In ''ansjovis'' ("anchovy"), the second part was modified to resemble ''vis'' ("fish"), although the word originates in Spanish ''anchova'';
* In ''jeruzalemartisjok'' (“Jerusalem artichoke"), the first word part was modified from Italian ''girasole'' in the same way as in English;
* In ''scheurbuik'' ("scurvy"), the word parts were modified to resemble ''scheur-'' (stem of ''scheuren'', tear open) and ''buik'' ("belly, stomach"), although the word originates in Middle Low German ''schorbuck'';
* In ''sprokkelmaand'' (an alternative name for ''februari'', "February"), the first part was modified to resemble ''sprokkelen'' ("gather wood"), although the word originates in Latin ''spurcalia'';
* In ''witbier'' the first word part was modified from the German word ''Weizen'' ("wheat") to resemble ''wit'' ("white");
* In ''zijdenhemdje'' (a variety of apple with a very soft, thin, yellow skin), the word parts were modified to resemble ''zijden'' ("silken") and ''hemdje'' ("shirt; small shirt; vest"), although the word actually denotes the place Sydenham where the apple originates.sfn|van Dale|2015
* Dutch dictionary ''Van Dale'' describes ''balkenbrij'' as a particularly notable example.
* Other examples are angstvallig, dukdalf, geeuwhonger, hagedis, hondsdraf, penthouse, rederijker, rendier and zondvloed.

harvtxt|Mailhammer|2008 "applies the concepts of multisourced neologisation and, more generally, camouflaged borrowing, as established by harvtxt|Zuckermann|2003a to Modern German, pursuing a twofold aim, namely to underline the significance of multisourced neologisation for language contact theory and secondly to demonstrate that together with other forms of camouflaged borrowing it remains an important borrowing mechanism in contemporary German."sfn|Mailhammer|2008|page=191

=Arabic=
harvtxt|Zuckermann|2009|page=60 analyses the evolution of the word ''artichoke''. Beginning in Arabic lang|ar|الخرشوف (''transl|ar|'al-xarshūf'') "the artichoke", it was adapted into Spanish Arabic ''alxarshofa'', then Old Spanish ''alcarchofa'', then Italian language|Italian ''alcarcioffo'', North Italian ''arcicioffo'' > ''arciciocco'' > ''articiocco'', then as the internationalism (linguistics)|internationalism phonetically realized in English as ''artichoke''. The word was eventually ''phono-semantically matched'' back into colloquial Levantine Arabic (for example in Syria, Lebanon and Israel) as lang|ar|أرضي شوكي ''arḍī shōkī'', consisting of lang|ar|أرضي ''arḍī'' "earthly" and lang|ar|شوكي ''shawkī'' "thorny".

Arabic has made use of phono-semantic matching to replace blatantly imported new terminology with a word derived from an existing triliteral root. Examples are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! English word !! Unarabicised import !! Arabicised word !! Pre-existing root (meaning)
|-
| Technology || transl|ar|tiknulugiyah || lang|ar|تقانة transl|ar|taqānah || t-q-n (skill)
|-
| Mitochondria || lang|ar|الميتوكُندريات transl|ar|mītūkundriyah || lang|ar|متقدرة transl|ar|mutaqaddirah || q-d-r (power)
|-
| Machine || || lang|ar|مكنة transl|ar|makinah || m-k-n (capacity)
|}

=Marketing names=
''Viagra'', a brand name which was suggested by Interbrand Wood (the consultancy firm hired by Pfizer), is itself a multisourced neologism, based on Sanskrit lang|sa|व्याघ्र ''IAST|vyāghráh'' ("tiger") but enhanced by the words ''vigour'' (i.e. strength) and ''Niagara'' (i.e. free/forceful flow).sfn|Zuckermann|2003a|page= 59

Motivations
According to harvtxt|Zuckermann|2003a, PSM has various advantages from the point of view of the puristic language planner:

* recycling obsolete lexical items
* camouflaging foreign influence (for the native speaker in the future)
* facilitating initial learning (mnemonics) (for the contemporary learner/speaker)

Other motivations for PSM include the following:

* playfulness (cf. midrashic tradition of homiletic commentary, cf. the Jewish ''pilpul'')
* Apollonianism (the wish to create order/meaningfulness, cf. folk etymology, etymythology, paronymic attraction)
* iconicity (the belief that there is something intrinsic about the sound of names.)
* political correctness / rejective lexical engineering
* attracting customers (in the case of brand names)

Expressive loan
An expressive loan is a loanword incorporated into the expressive system of the borrowing language, making it resemble native words or onomatopoeia.  Expressive loanwords are hard to identify, and by definition, they follow the common phonetic sound change patterns poorly. sfn|Laakso|2010 Likewise, there is a continuum between "pure" loanwords and "expressive" loanwords. The difference to a folk etymology is that a folk etymology or eggcorn is based on misunderstanding, whereas an expressive loan is changed on purpose, the speaker taking the loanword knowing full well that the descriptive quality is different from the original sound and meaning.

South-eastern Finnish language|Finnish, for example, has many expressive loans. The main source language, Russian language|Russian, does not use the  front rounded vowels 'y', 'ä' or 'ö' [y æ ø]. Thus, it is common to add these to redescriptivized loans to remove the degree of foreignness that the loanword would otherwise have. For example, ''tytinä'' "brawn" means "wobblyness", and superficially it looks like a native construction, originating from the verb ''tutista'' "to wobble" added with a front vowel sound in the vowel harmony. However, it is expressivized from ''tyyteni'' (which is a confusing word as ''-ni'' is a possessive suffix), which in turn is a loanword from Russian ''stúden' ''.sfn|Jarva|2001 A somewhat more obvious example is ''tökötti'' "sticky, tarry goo", which could be mistaken as a derivation from the onomatopoetic word ''tök'' (cf. the verb ''tökkiä'' "to poke"). However, it is an expressive loan of Russian ''d'ogot' '' "tar".sfn|Jarva|2003
