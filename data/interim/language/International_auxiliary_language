An international auxiliary languageefn-ua| The term was used at least as early as 1908, by Otto Jespersen.  (sometimes abbreviated as IAL or auxlang) or interlanguage is a language meant for communication between people from different nations who do not share a common first language. An auxiliary language is primarily a foreign language.

Languages of dominant societies over the centuries have served as lingua francas that sometimes approaches the international level. Latin, Greek language|Greek and the Mediterranean Lingua Franca were used in the past, and Modern Standard Arabic|(Standard) Arabic, Standard Chinese, English language|English, French language|French, Portuguese language|Portuguese, Russian language|Russian and Spanish language|Spanish have been used as such in recent times in many parts of the world.<ref name="bodmer_pei">Bodmer, Frederick. ''The loom of language'' and Pei, Mario. ''One language for the world.''</ref>

However, as lingua francas are traditionally associated with the very dominance—cultural, political, and economic—that made them popular, they are often also met with resistance. For this and other reasons, some have turned to the idea of promoting an artificial or constructed language as a possible solution, by way of "auxiliary" language.<ref name="bodmer_pei"/> The term "auxiliary" implies that it is intended to be an additional language for the people of the world, rather than to replace their native languages. Often, the term is used to refer to planned or constructed languages proposed specifically to ease international communication, such as Esperanto, Ido (language)|Ido and Interlingua. However, it can also refer to the concept of such a language being determined by international consensus, including even a standardized natural language (e.g., International English), and has also been connected to the project of constructing a universal language.

 History 

The use of an intermediary auxiliary language (also called a "working language", "bridge language", "vehicular language" or "unifying language") to make communication possible between people not sharing a first language, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both mother tongues,<ref>Viacheslav A. Chirikba, "The problem of the Caucasian Sprachbund" in Pieter Muysken, ed., ''From Linguistic Areas to Areal Linguistics'', 2008, p. 31. ISBN|90-272-3100-1</ref> may be almost as old as language itself. Certainly they have existed since antiquity. Latin and Ancient Greek|Greek (or Koiné language|Koiné Greek) were the intermediary language of all areas of the Mediterraneum; Akkadian language|Akkadian, and then Aramaic language|Aramaic, remained the common languages of a large part of Western Asia through several earlier empires.<ref>Ostler, 2005 pp. 38–40</ref> Such natural languages used for communication between people not sharing the same mother tongue are called ''lingua francas''.

=Natural international languages: Lingua francas=
''Lingua francas'' have arisen around the globe throughout human history, sometimes for commercial reasons (so-called "trade languages") but also for diplomatic and administrative convenience, and as a means of exchanging information between scientists and other scholars of different nationalities. The term originates with one such language, Mediterranean Lingua Franca, a pidgin language used as a trade language in the Mediterranean area from the 11th to the 19th century. Examples of lingua francas remain numerous, and exist on every continent. The most obvious example as of the early 21st century is English language|English. There are many other lingua francas centralized on particular regions, such as Arabic, Chinese, French, Greek, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.<ref>cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/best-languages-influence-world/ | title=Languages that Influence the World </ref>

=Constructed languages=
main|Constructed language
Since all natural languages display a number of irregularities in grammar which makes them more difficult to learn, and they are also associated with the national and cultural dominance of the nation that speaks it as its mother tongue,citation needed|date=April 2015|reason=Both assertions in this sentence need to be sourced to a reliable source. attention began to focus on the idea of creating an artificial or constructed language as a possible solution. The concept of simplifying an existing language to make it an auxiliary language was already in the ''Encyclopédie'' of the 18th century, where Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve, in the article on ''Langue'', wrote a short proposition of a "laconic" or regularized grammar of French.

Some of the philosophical languages of the 17th–18th centuries could be regarded as proto-auxlangs, as they were intended by their creators to serve as bridges among people of different languages as well as to disambiguate and clarify thought. However, most or all of these languages were, as far as can be told from the surviving publications about them, too incomplete and unfinished to serve as auxlangs (or for any other practical purpose). The first fully developed constructed languages we know of, as well as the first constructed languages devised primarily as auxlangs, originated in the 19th century; Solresol by François Sudre (1787–1862), a language based on musical notes, was the first to gain widespread attention although not, apparently, fluent speakers.

=Volapük=
main|Volapük
During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such constructed international auxiliary languages (IALs) were proposed, so Louis Couturat and Léopold Leau in ''Histoire de la langue universelle'' (1903) reviewed 38 projects.

Volapük, first described in an article in 1879 by Johann Martin Schleyer and in book form the following year, was the first to garner a widespread international speaker community. Three major Volapük conventions were held, in 1884, 1887, and 1889; the last of them used Volapük as its working language. André Cherpillod writes of the third Volapük convention,quote|In August 1889 the third convention was held in Paris. About two hundred people from many countries attended. And, unlike in the first two conventions, people spoke only Volapük. For the first time in the history of mankind, sixteen years before World Congress of Esperanto|the Boulogne convention, an international convention spoke an international language.<ref name="cherpillod1995">Foreword to ''Konciza Gramatiko de Volapuko'', André Cherpillod. Courgenard, 1995.</ref>
However, not long after, the Volapük speaker community broke up due to various factors including controversies between Schleyer and other prominent Volapük speakers, and the appearance of newer, second-language acquisition|easier-to-learn constructed languages, primarily History of Esperanto|Esperanto.

=From ''Kadem bevünetik volapüka'' to ''Academia pro Interlingua''=

Answering the needs of the first successful artificial language community, the Volapükists established the regulatory body of their language, under the name International Volapük Academy (''Kadem bevünetik volapüka'') at the second Volapük congress in Munich in August 1887.<ref>Schmidt, Johann. 1964. ''Jenotem valemapüka Volapük''. Amsterdam: Volapükagased.</ref><ref>Schmidt, Johann. 1996. ''Historio de la universala lingvo Volapuko''. Translator: Philippe Combot. Courgenard: La Blanchetière. ISBN|2-906134-30-9</ref> The Academy was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language Volapük, but soon conflicts arose between conservative Volapükists and those who wanted to reform Volapük to make it a more naturalistic language based on the grammar and vocabulary of major world languages. In 1890 Schleyer himself left the original Academy and created a new Volapük Academy with the same name, from people completely loyal to him, which continues to this day.

Under Waldemar Rosenberger, who became the director in 1892, the original Academy began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volapük. The vocabulary and the grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were completely discarded, so that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named "Idiom Neutral". The name of the Academy was changed to ''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'' in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year.

In 1903, the mathematician Giuseppe Peano published his completely new approach to language construction. Inspired by the idea of philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, instead of inventing schematic structures and ''a priori'' language, he chose to simplify an existing and once widely used international language, Latin. This simplified Latin, devoid of inflections and declensions, was named ''Interlingua'' by Peano but is usually referred to as "Latino sine flexione".

Impressed by Peano's Interlingua, the ''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'' effectively chose to abandon Idiom Neutral in favor of Peano's Interlingua in 1908, and it elected Peano as its director. The name of the group then was changed to ''Academia pro Interlingua'' (where ''Interlingua'' stands for Peano's language). The ''Academia pro Interlingua'' survived until about 1939. It was partly Peano's Interlingua that inspired the better-known Interlingua presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).

=Esperanto=
main|History of Esperanto

After the emergence of Volapük, a wide variety of other auxiliary languages were devised and proposed in the 1880s–1900s, but none except Esperanto gathered a significant speaker community. Esperanto was developed from about 1873–1887 (a Proto-Esperanto#The Lingwe uniwersala of 1878|first version was ready in 1878), and finally published in 1887, by L. L. Zamenhof, as a primarily schematic language; the word stems are borrowed from Romance, West Germanic and Slavic languages. The key to the relative success of Esperanto was probably the highly productive and elastic system of Esperanto vocabulary|derivational word formation which allowed speakers to derive hundreds of other words by learning one word root. Moreover, Esperanto is quicker to learn than other languages, usually in a third up to a fifth of the time.citation needed| date= September 2017 From early on, Esperantists created their Esperanto culture|own culture which helped to form the Esperantujo|Esperanto language community.

Within a few years this language had thousands of fluent speakers, primarily in eastern Europe. In 1905 its first world convention was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars. Esperanto has become "the most outlandishly successful invented language ever" and the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language.<ref>citation

=Ido and the Esperantidos=
main|Ido (language)
The Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language was founded in 1900 by Louis Couturat and others; it tried to get the International Association of Academies to take up the question of an international auxiliary language, study the existing ones and pick one or design a new one. However, the meta-academy declining to do so, the Delegation decided to do the job itself.<ref name="jesperson1928">Otto Jesperson, ''An International Language''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20091029033240/http://geocities.com/Athens/Forum/5037/AILido.html  "The Delegation. Ido."] 1928.</ref> Among Esperanto speakers there was a general impression that the Delegation would of course choose Esperanto, as it was the only auxlang with a sizable speaker community at the time; it was felt as a betrayal by many Esperanto speakers when in 1907 the Delegation came up with its own reformed version of Esperanto, Ido.<ref name="harlow2000">Harlow, Don.

Besides Ido, a great number of simplified Esperantos, called Esperantidos, emerged as concurrent language projects; still, Ido remains today one of the three most widely spoken auxlangs.

=Occidental (Interlingue) and Novial=
main|Occidental language
Edgar von Wahl's Occidental language|Occidental (also called "Interlingue") of 1922 was in reaction against the perceived artificiality of some earlier auxlangs, particularly Esperanto. Inspired by Idiom Neutral and Latino sine flexione|Peano's Interlingua, von Wahl created a language whose words, including compound words, would have a high degree of recognizability for those who already know a Romance language. However, this design criterion was in conflict with the ease of coining new compound or derived words on the fly while speaking. Occidental gained a small speaker community in the 1920s and 1930s, and supported several publications, but had almost entirely died out by the 1980s.<ref name="harlow2000"/> More recently Occidental has been revived on the Internet.

In 1928 Ido's major intellectual supporter, the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen, abandoned Ido, and published his own planned language, Novial.<ref>cite web

</ref> It was mostly inspired by Idiom Neutral and Occidental, yet it attempted a derivational formalism and schematism sought by Esperanto and Ido. The notability of its creator helped the growth of this auxiliary language, but soon both Novial and Occidental were abandoned in favour of Interlingua, the first auxiliary language based fully on scientific methodology.

=Interlingua=
main|History of Interlingua
The International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) was founded in 1924 by Alice Vanderbilt Morris; like the earlier ''Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language'', its mission was to study language problems and the existing auxlangs and proposals for auxlangs, and to negotiate some consensus between the supporters of various auxlangs. However, like the Delegation, it finally decided to create its own auxlang. History of Interlingua|Interlingua, published in 1951, was primarily the work of Alexander Gode, though he built on preliminary work by earlier IALA linguists including André Martinet, and relied on elements from previous naturalistic auxlang projects, like Peano's Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Jespersen's Novial, von Walh's Occidental (Interlingue), and the Academy's Idiom Neutral. Like Occidental, Interlingua was designed to have words recognizable at sight by those who already know a Romance language or a language like English with much vocabulary borrowed from Romance languages; to attain this end the IALA accepted a degree of grammatical and orthographic complexity considerably greater than in Esperanto or Occidental, though still less than in any natural language.

The theory underlying Interlingua posits an ''international vocabulary'', a large number of words and affixes that are present in a wide range of languages. This already existing international vocabulary was shaped by social forces, science and technology, to "all corners of the world". The goal of the International Auxiliary Language Association was to accept into Interlingua every widely international word in whatever languages it occurred.<ref>Words appearing in only a few, closely related languages were ignored. See Gode, Alexander, Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company.</ref> They conducted studies to identify "the most generally international vocabulary possible", while still maintaining the unity of the language.<ref>Gode, Alexander, Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company (p. xxii).</ref> This scientific approach of generating a language from selected source languages (called ''control languages'') resulted in a vocabulary and grammar that can be called the highest common factor of each major European language.

Interlingua gained a significant speaker community, perhaps roughly the same size as that of Ido (considerably less than the size of Esperanto). Interlingua's success can be explained by the fact that it is the most widely ''understood'' international auxiliary language by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.<ref name="blandino1989">Blandino, Giovanni, "Le problema del linguas international auxiliari", ''Philosophia del Cognoscentia e del Scientia'', Rome, Italy: Pontificia Universitas Lateranensis, Pontificia Universitas Urbaniana, 1989.</ref> Interlingua has some active speakers currently on all continents, and the language is propagated by the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI), and Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.<ref>"Radioemissiones in e re Interlingua," ''Panorama in Interlingua'', Issue 3, 2006.</ref>

After the creation of Interlingua, there were no more successful attempts in international language engineering that would attract a significant number of supporters, thus the enthusiasm about constructed languages gradually decreased in the years between 1960–1990.

The [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/conlang.html CONLANG mailing list] was founded in 1991; in its early years discussion focused on international auxiliary languages. As people interested in artistic languages and engineered languages grew to be the majority of the list members, and flame-wars between proponents of particular auxlangs irritated these members, a separate [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/auxlang.html AUXLANG mailing list] was created in 1997, which has been the primary venue for discussion of auxlangs since then.  Besides giving the existing auxlangs with speaker communities a chance to interact rapidly online as well as slowly through postal mail or more rarely in personal meetings, the Internet has also made it easier to publicize new auxlang projects, and a handful of these have gained a small speaker community, including Kotava, Lingua Franca Nova, Lingwa de planeta|Lingwa de Planeta, Pandunia, Sambahsa, and Toki Pona.<ref>Although Toki Pona was not intended by its creator as an auxlang, it has been used for communication between people of different native languages far more often than most of the thousands of auxlang proposals throughout history.Citation needed|date=June 2011|reason=inline cite needs to mention a source, or be converted to a sourced footnote</ref><ref>Cite journal|last=Libert|first=Alan Reed|date=2018-06-25|title=Artificial Languages|url=http://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-11|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-11</ref>

=Zonal constructed languages=
main|Zonal constructed language

Not every international auxiliary language is necessarily intended to be used on a global scale. A special subgroup are languages created to facilitate communication between speakers of a certain group of related languages. The oldest known example is a Pan-Slavic language written in 1665 by the Croatian priest Juraj Križanić. He named this language Interslavic language#Early projects|Ruski ("Russian"), but in reality it was a mixture of the Russian edition of Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic, his own Southern Chakavian dialect of Serbo-Croatian, and, to a lesser degree, Polish language|Polish.<ref>cite web|url=http://miresperanto.com/esperantologio/interlingv_mysl.htm|title=ИЗ ИСТОРИИ ИНТЕРЛИНГВИСТИЧЕСКОЙ МЫСЛИ В РОССИИ|publisher=Miresperanto.com|accessdate=11 January 2015</ref>

Most zonal constructed languages were created during the period of romantic nationalism at the end of the 19th century; some were created later. Particularly numerous are the Pan-Slavic languages.<ref>cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/constructed_slavic_languages.html|title=Constructed Slavic Languages|author=Jan van Steenbergen|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=11 January 2015</ref> However, similar efforts have been made at creating umbrella languages for other language families as well: Tutonish (1902) and Folkspraak (1995) for the Germanic languages, Romanid (1956) for the Romance languages, and Afrihili (1973) for the African continent.

 Scholarly study 
expand section|date=January 2015
In the early 1900s auxlangs were already becoming a subject of academic study.  Louis Couturat et al.<ref>Louis Couturat|L. Couturat, Otto Jesperson|O. Jespersen, R. Lorenz, W.Ostwalkd and L.Pfaundler. ''International Language and Science: Considerations on the Introduction of an International Language into Science.'' 1910.</ref> described the controversy in the preface to their book ''International Language and Science'':

:The question of a so-called world-language, or better expressed, an international auxiliary language, was during the now past Volapük period, and is still in the present Esperanto movement, so much in the hands of Utopians, fanatics and enthusiasts, that it is difficult to form an unbiased opinion concerning it, although a good idea lies at its basis. (1910, p. v). <!-- this seems like an inept translation of the original text, but I don't have the original text available to do a better xltn -->

Leopold Pfaundler wrote that an IAL was needed for more effective communication among scientists:

:All who are occupied with the reading or writing of scientific literature have assuredly very often felt the want of a common scientific language, and regretted the great loss of time and trouble caused by the multiplicity of languages employed in scientific literature.

For Couturat et al., Volapukists and Esperantists confounded the linguistic aspect of the question with many side issues, and they considered this a main reason why discussion about the idea of an international auxiliary language has appeared unpractical.

Some contemporaries of Couturat, notably Edward Sapir<ref>Sapir, Edward (1931). "The function of an international auxiliary language". Romanic Review (11): 4–15.</ref><ref>Sapir, Edward (1925). "Memorandum on the problem of an international auxiliary language". The Romanic Review (16): 244–256</ref> saw the challenge of an auxiliary language not as much as that of identifying a descriptive linguistic answer (of grammar and vocabulary) to global communicative concerns, but rather as one of promoting the notion of a linguistic platform for lasting international understanding. Though interest among scholars, and linguists in particular, waned greatly throughout the 20th century,<ref>Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul. 2015.

Writing systems
Several IAL use the Latin script, some of them like LFN also offer an alternative in the Cyrillic script.

=Latin script=
The vast majority of IALs use the Latin script. Several sounds, e.g. /n/, /m/, /t/, /f/ are written with the same letter as in IPA.

Some consonant sounds found in several Latin-script IAL alphabets are not represented by an ISO 646 letter in IPA. Three have a single letter in IPA, one has a widespread alternative taken from ISO 646:
* /ʃ/ (U+0283, IPA 134)
* /ʒ/ (U+0292, IPA 135)
* /ɡ/ (U+0261, IPA 110, single storey g) = g (U+0067, double storey g)
Four are affricates, each represented in IPA by two letters and a combining marker. They are often written decomposed:
* /t͡s/ = /ts/
* /t͡ʃ/ = /tʃ/; Note: Polish distinguishes between them
* /d͡z/ = /dz/
* /d͡ʒ/ = /dʒ/

That means that two sounds that are one character in IPA and are not ISO 646, also have no common alternative in ISO 646: ʃ, ʒ.

Classification<!-- This section is linked from Interlingua -->

The following classification of auxiliary languages was developed by Pierre Janton in 1993:<ref>Pierre Janton, ''Esperanto: Language, Literature, and Community.'' Translated by Humphrey Tonkin et al.  State University of New York Press, 1993. ISBN|0-7914-1254-7.</ref>

* A priori (languages)|''A priori'' languages are characterized by largely artificial morphemes (not borrowed from natural languages), schematic Morphological derivation|derivation, simple phonology, grammar and morphology (linguistics)|morphology. Some ''a priori'' languages are called philosophical languages, referring to their basis in philosophical ideas about thought and language. These include some of the earliest efforts at auxiliary language in the 17th century. Some more specific subcategories:
** Oligosynthetic language|Oligosynthetic or oligoisolating languages have no more than a few hundred morphemes. Most of their vocabulary is made of compound words or set phrases formed from these morphemes. Sona language (artificial)|Sona and Toki Pona are well known examples, although Toki Pona's word stock is mostly based on other languages and therefore not ''a priori''.
** Taxonomic languages form their words using a taxonomic hierarchy, with each phoneme of a word helping specify its position in a semantic hierarchy of some kind; for example, Solresol and Ro (language)|Ro.
** Pasigraphy|Pasigraphies are purely written languages without a spoken form, or with a spoken form left at the discretion of the reader; many of the 17th–18th century philosophical languages and auxlangs were pasigraphies.  This set historically tends to overlap with taxonomic languages, though there is no inherent reason a pasigraphy needs to be taxonomic.citation needed|date=January 2013
** Logical languages such as Lojban and its predecessor, Loglan, aim to eliminate ambiguity. Both these examples, it should be noted, derive their morphemes from a broad range of natural languages using statistical methods.
* ''A posteriori'' languages are based on existing natural languages. Nearly all the auxiliary languages with fluent speakers are in this category.<ref name="harlow2006">cite web |last= Harlow |first= Don |date= 7 January 2006 |title= Essay (hopefully long) |url= http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0601a&L=auxlang&P=13620 |work=AUXLANG mailing list  |location= |access-date=  date  | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130523160549/http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0601a&L=auxlang&P=13620 | archivedate= 23 May 2013 | deadurl= yes| quote= </ref> Most of the ''a posteriori'' auxiliary languages borrow their vocabulary primarily or solely from European languages, and base their grammar more or less on European models. (Sometimes these European-based languages are referred to as "euroclones", although this term has negative connotations and is not used in the academic literature.citation needed|date=January 2013) Interlingua was drawn originally from international scientific vocabulary, in turn based primarily on Greek and Latin roots.citation needed|date=January 2013 Glosa did likewise, with a stronger dependence of Greek roots. Although ''a posteriori'' languages have been based on most of the families of European languages, the most successful of these (notably Esperanto,<ref>http://failuremag.com/feature/article/discouraging_words/</ref> Ido and Interlingua) have been based largely on Romance elements.citation needed|date=January 2013
** Schematic (or "mixed") languages have some ''a priori'' qualities.  Some have ethnic morphemes but alter them significantly to fit a simplified Phonotactics|phonotactic pattern (e.g., Volapük, Toki Pona) or both artificial and natural morphemes (e.g., Perio). Partly schematic languages have partly schematic and partly naturalistic derivation (e.g. Esperanto and Ido). Natural morphemes of languages in this group are rarely altered greatly from their source-language form, but compound and derived words are generally not recognizable at sight by people familiar with the source languages.citation needed|date=January 2013
** Naturalistic languages resemble existing natural languages.  For example, Occidental language|Occidental, Interlingua, and Lingua Franca Nova were developed so that not only the root words but their compounds and derivations will often be recognizable immediately by large numbers of people. Some naturalistic languages do have a limited number of artificial morphemes or invented grammatical devices (e.g. Novial). (Note that the term "naturalistic" as used in auxiliary language scholarshipWhich|date=January 2013 does not mean the same thing as the homophonous term used in describing artistic languages.<ref>[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0908E&L=CONLANG&D=0&T=0&P=5208 "Re: "Naturalistic" for auxlangers vs artlangers?"]  AUXLANG mailing list post by Jörg Rhiemeier, 30 August 2009</ref>Better source|date=January 2013)
** Simplified natural languages reduce the full extent of vocabulary and partially regularize the grammar of a natural language (e.g. Basic English, Special English and Globish (Nerriere)|Globish).citation needed|date=January 2013

Methods of propagation

As has been pointed out, the issue of an international language is not so much which, but how.<ref>Mario Pei, ''One language for the world'' (1958)</ref> Several approaches exist toward the eventual full expansion and consolidation of an international auxiliary language.
# Laissez-faire. This approach is taken in the belief that one language will eventually and inevitably "win out" as a world auxiliary language (e.g. International English) without any need for specific action.
# Institutional sponsorship and grass-roots promotion of language programs. This approach has taken various forms, depending on the language and language type, ranging from government promotion of a particular language to one-on-one encouragement to learn the language to instructional or marketing programs.
# National legislation. This approach seeks to have individual countries (or even localities) progressively endorse a given language as an official language (or to promote the concept of international legislation).
# International legislation. This approach involves promotion of the future holding of a binding international convention (perhaps to be under the auspices of such international organizations as the United Nations or Inter-Parliamentary Union) to formally agree upon an official international auxiliary language which would then be taught in all schools around the world, beginning at the primary level. This approach, an official principle of the Baha'i Faith, seeks to put a combination of international opinion, linguistic expertise, and law behind a to-be-selected language and thus expand or consolidate it as a full official world language, to be used in addition to local languages.<ref>See an edited compilation of excerpts from the Bahá'í writings regarding the principle of International or Universal Auxiliary Language: The Greatest Instrument for Promoting Harmony and Civilization: Excerpts from the Bahá'í Writings and Related Sources on the Question of an International Auxiliary Language. Gregory Paul Meyjes, ed. Oxford: George Ronald. 2015. ISBN|978-085398-591-4</ref> This approach could either give more credibility to a natural language already serving this purpose to a certain degree (e.g. if English were chosen) or to give a greatly enhanced chance for a constructed language to take root. For constructed languages particularly, this approach has been seen by various individuals in the IAL movement as holding the most promise of ensuring that promotion of studies in the language would not be met with skepticism at its practicality by its would-be learners.

Pictorial languages

There have been a number of proposals for using pictures, ideograms, diagrams, and other pictorial representations for international communications. Examples range from the original Characteristica Universalis proposed by the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz, to suggestions for the adoption of Chinese writing, to recent inventions such as Blissymbol.<ref>Charles Keisel Bliss, ''Semantography (Blissymbolics)''</ref>

Within the scientific community, there is already considerable agreement in the form of the schematics used to represent circuit diagram|electronic circuits, chemical symbols, mathematical symbols, and the Energy Systems Language of systems ecology. We can also see the international efforts at regularizing symbols used to regulate traffic, to indicate resources for tourists, and in maps. Some symbols have become nearly universal through their consistent use in computers and on the internet.

Sign languages

An international auxiliary sign language has been developed by deaf people who meet regularly at international forums such as sporting events or in political organisations. Previously referred to as Gestuno<ref>Rubino, F., Hayhurst, A., and Guejlman, J., ''Gestuno: International sign language of the deaf.''</ref> but now more commonly known simply as 'International Sign|international sign', the language has continued to develop since the first signs were standardised in 1973, and it is now in widespread use. International sign is distinct in many ways from spoken IALs; many signs are Iconicity|iconic and signers tend to insert these signs into the grammar of their own sign language, with an emphasis on visually intuitive gestures and mime. A simple sign language called Plains Indian Sign Language was used by indigenous peoples of the Americas.

Gestuno is not to be confused with the separate and unrelated sign language Signuno, which is essentially a Signed Exact Esperanto. Signuno is not in any significant use, and is based on the Esperanto community rather than based on the international Deaf community.

Criticism

There has been considerable criticism of international auxiliary languages, both in terms of individual proposals, types of proposals, and in more general terms.

Criticisms directed against Esperanto and other early auxiliary languages in the late 19th century included the idea that different races have sufficiently different speech organs that an international language might work locally in Europe, but hardly worldwide, and the prediction that if adopted, such an auxlang would rapidly break up into local dialects.<ref name="zamenhof1900">"Esenco kaj Estonteco de la Ideo de Lingvo Internacia", L. L. Zamenhof, 1900.  Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', 1992 [1903].</ref> Advances in linguistics have done away with the first of these, and the limited but significant use of Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua on an international scale, without breakup into unintelligible dialects, has shown that either a rapid break-up into dialects shall not happen too soon in the future, or that there is enough constant 'standardisation' to reduce the diversity of the language. Subsequently, much criticism has been focused either on the artificiality of these auxlangs,<ref name="piron1994"/> or on the argumentativeness of auxlang proponents and their failure to agree on one auxlang, or even on objective criteria by which to judge auxlangs.<ref>[http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html "Farewell to auxiliary languages"] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230133/http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html |date=2012-07-16 , by Richard K. Harrison. 1997.</ref>  However, probably the most common criticism is that a constructed auxlang is unnecessary because natural languages such as English are already in wide use as auxlangs and work well enough for that purpose.

One criticism already prevalent in the late 19th century, and still sometimes heard today, is that an international language might hasten the Language death|extinction of minority languages. One response has been that, even if this happens, the benefits would outweigh the costs;.<ref name="zamenhof1900"/><ref name="oslak2005">"Ĉu Zamenhof Pravis?", Vinko Ošlak, ''Fonto'', februaro 2005.</ref> Another response has been that proponents of auxlangs, particularly in the Esperanto movement, are often thought to also be proponents of measures to conserve and promote minority languageswhy|date=May 2013 and cultures. Based on Baha'i writ, Meyjes (2006) sees an International Auxiliary Language intended to be implemented in ways that shield native tongues from undue pressures from any traditional lingua franca, while enabling inter-community communication worldwide <ref>Also see "universalization" in Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul. 1999. Language and Universalization: An Ecolinguistic Reading of Bahá’í writ. The Journal of Bahá’í Studies, 9 (1): 51- 63. Toronto: Association for Bahá’í Studies (Canada); in German: 2003. Sprache und Universalisierung: "Sprachökologie" im Bahá'í Schrifttum. Schriftenreihe des Gesellschaft für Bahá'í Studien. Vol. 7. Hofheim (Ts.): Bahá’í Verlag. 129-146</ref>

Although referred to as ''international'' languages, most of these languages have historically been constructed on the basis of Western European languages.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was common for Volapük and Esperanto, and to some extent Ido, to be criticized for not being Western European enough; Occidental and Interlingua were (among other things) responses to this kind of criticism. More recently all these major auxlangs have been criticized for being too European and not global enough.<ref name="kupsala2005">[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0512A&L=AUXLANG&T=0&F=&S=&P=2560 "Types of neutrality, and central concerns for an IAL"].  AUXLANG mailing list post by Risto Kupsala, 2 December 2005.</ref>  One response to this criticism has been that doing otherwise in no way makes the language easier for anyone, while drawing away from the sources of much international vocabulary, technical and popular.<ref>Alexander Gode, quoted by Mario Pei in ''One language for the world'' (1958).</ref>  Another response, primarily from Esperanto speakers, is that the internationality of a language has more to do with the culture of its speakers than with its linguistic properties. Esperanto itself uses individual words from Indo-European languages, but its grammar is much more similar to Chinese and Greek, (while being flexible enough in grammar and sentence structure to be able to copy the word-order of Japanese, Indonesian and English all about as well as each other) so it's difficult to judge how much of an Indo-European language it even is.<ref name="harlow2006"/>  The term "Euroclone" was coined to refer to these languages in contrast to worldlang|"worldlangs" with global vocabulary sources; the term is sometimes applied only to self-proclaimed "naturalistic" auxlangs such as Occidental and Interlingua, sometimes to all auxlangs with primarily European vocabulary sources, regardless of their grammar, including Esperanto and Lingua Franca Nova.

The response to this argument was made by Alexander Gode<ref>Gode, Alexander, et al. ''Interlingua-English: a dictionary of the international language.'' Storm Publishers, New York, 1951.</ref> and reiterated by Mario Pei:<ref>Pei, Mario. ''One Language for the World.'' N.Y.: Devin-Adair, 1958:</ref> A vocabulary selected from a broad variety of languages does not make the language any easier for speakers of any one language. Gode's example compares a paragraph in Interlingua with a paragraph with words from Chinese, Japanese, Malay, and other non-European languages. The first, he argues, should be understood by those familiar with the Romance languages, and not overly difficult for most English speakers:

:La sol dice: "io me appella sol. Io es multo brillante. Io me leva al est, e cuando io me leva, il es die. Io reguarda per tu fenestra con mi oculo brillante como le auro, e io te dice quando il es tempore a levar te. E io te dice: 'Pigro, leva te. Io non brilla a fin que tu resta al lecto a dormir, sed que tu lege e que tu te promena.'"

The second, in contrast, should not only be difficult for speakers of European languages, but Malay speakers likely will not understand the Chinese words, Chinese speakers will likely not understand the Japanese words, and Japanese speakers likely will not understand the Malay words:

:Mata-hari yu: "Wo-ti nama mata-hari. Wo taihen brillante. Wo leva wo a est, dan toki wo leva wo, ada hari. Wo miru per ni-ti fenestra sama wo-ti mata brillante como kin, dan wo yu ni toki ada tempo a levar ni. Dan wo yu ni: 'Sust, leva ni. Wo non brilla sam-rap ni tomaru a toko a nemuru, sed wo brilla sam-rap ni leva ni, dan que ni suru kam, ni yomu, dan ni aruku.'"

An ''a priori'' vocabulary such as that of Spokil or Kotava, or a vocabulary constructed mathematically, such as that of Loglan or Lojban, would likely be as comprehensible.

Gode argues, additionally, that the western languages are the unofficial languages of international science, medicine, and technology, and therefore an IAL based on them provides the best access to that literature. Nevertheless, it must be said that a more neutral vocabulary, perhaps even an ''a priori'' one, would be less offensive to some non-Europeans.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, many proposals for auxlangs based on global sources of vocabulary and grammar have been made, but most (like the majority of the European-based auxlangs of earlier decades) remain sketches too incomplete to be speakable, and of the more complete ones, few have gained any speakers.  More recently there has been a trend, on the AUXLANG mailing list and on the more recently founded [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/worldlanglist/ worldlang mailing list], to greater collaboration between various proponents of a more globally based auxlang.
