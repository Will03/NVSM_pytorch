Please note!!!
In order for a list of languages to make sense, the whole list must be based on the same source to decrease the risks of large differences in measurements and estimates. This article formerly used the estimates of SIL Ethnologue, but a broad consensus on the talk page agreed that it was not reliable. If you think you have found a better source that lists languages by native speakers, please bring it to the attention of other users by using the talk page! If you want to change just the number of speakers for just one language, or a few languages, please don't!

This article ranks human languages by their number of native speakers.

However, all such rankings should be used with caution, because it is not possible to devise a coherent set of linguistic criteria for distinguishing languages in a dialect continuum.<ref name="Paolillo&Das">cite web

For example, a language is often defined as a set of variety (linguistics)|varieties that are mutually intelligible, but independent national standard languages may be considered to be separate languages even though they are largely mutually intelligible, as in the case of Danish language|Danish and Norwegian language|Norwegian.<ref>cite book

Conversely, many commonly accepted languages, including German language|German, Italian language|Italian and even English language|English, encompass varieties that are not mutually intelligible.<ref name="Paolillo&Das"/>
While Arabic language|Arabic is sometimes considered a single language centred on Modern Standard Arabic, other authors describe its mutually unintelligible varieties as separate languages.<ref>cite book

Similarly, Chinese language|Chinese is sometimes viewed as a single language due to shared culture and a single written form.
It is also common to describe various Chinese dialect groups, such as Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin, Wu Chinese|Wu and Yue Chinese|Yue, as languages, even though each of these groups contains many mutually unintelligible varieties.<ref>cite book

There are also difficulties in obtaining reliable counts of speakers, which vary over time due to population change and language shift.
In some areas, there is no reliable census data, the data is not current, or the census may not record languages spoken, or record them ambiguously.
Sometimes speaker populations are exaggerated for political reasons, or speakers of minority languages may be under-reported in favour of a national language.<ref>cite book

Top languages by population
update section|date=November 2018|reason=the 2010 edition of ''Nationalencyklopedin'' has revised figures
The following table contains the top 100 languages by estimated number of native speakers in the 2007 edition of the Swedish encyclopedia ''Nationalencyklopedin''. As census methods in different countries vary to a considerable extent, and given that some countries do not record language in their censuses, any list of languages by native speakers, or total speakers, is effectively based on estimates. Updated estimates from 2010 are also provided.<ref name="Nationalencyklopedin">Mikael Parkvall, "Världens 100 största språk 2007" (The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007), in ''Nationalencyklopedin''. Asterisks mark the [http://www.ne.se/spr%C3%A5k/v%C3%A4rldens-100-st%C3%B6rsta-spr%C3%A5k-2010 2010 estimates] for the top dozen languages.</ref>

The top eleven languages have additional figures from the 2010 edition of the ''Nationalencyklopedin''. Numbers above 95 million are rounded off to the nearest 5 million.
