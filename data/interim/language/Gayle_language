Gayle, or Gail, is an South African English|English and Afrikaans-based gay argot or cant (language)|cant slang used primarily by English and Afrikaans-speaking homosexual men in urban communities of South Africa, and is similar in some respects to Polari in the United Kingdom, from which some lexical items have been borrowed.  The equivalent language used by homosexual South African men who speak Bantu languages is called ''IsiNgqumo'', and is based on a Nguni languages|Nguni lexicon.<ref name=CageQ>cite news|last1=Cage|first1=Ken|title=Gayle – Gay SA Slang|url=http://www.q.co.za/news/1999/9908/990810-gayle.html|accessdate=18 August 2000|work=Q Online|publisher=Mail & Guardian|date=10 August 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818005936/http://www.q.co.za/news/1999/9908/990810-gayle.html|archivedate=18 August 2000</ref><ref name=CageMA>cite thesis|degree=M.A. |last=Cage |first=Ken |title=An investigation into the form and function of language used by gay men in South Africa |publisher=University of Johannesburg |year=1999 |url=https://ujdigispace.uj.ac.za/handle/10210/6161 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140625081920/https://ujdigispace.uj.ac.za/handle/10210/6161 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 June 2014 |accessdate=25 June 2014 </ref><ref name=CageEvans>cite book|last1=Cage|first1=Ken|last2=Evans|first2=Moyra|title=Gayle: The Language of Kinks and Queens: A History and Dictionary of Gay Language in South Africa|date=2003|publisher=Jacana Media|location=Houghton, South Africa|isbn=9781919931494|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSn7026sq_cC|accessdate=25 June 2014</ref>

Gayle originally manifested as ''moffietaal'' (Afrikaans: literally, "homosexual language") in the drag (clothing)|drag culture of the Cape Coloured community in the 1950s.  It permeated into white homosexual circles in the 1960s and became part of mainstream white gay culture.<ref name=CageQ/><ref name=CageMA/><ref name=CageEvans/>

Besides a few core words borrowed from Polari (such as the word ''varda'' meaning "to see", itself a borrowing from Mediterranean Lingua Franca|Lingua Franca), most of Gayle's words are alliterative formations using women's names, such as ''Beulah (given name)|Beulah'' for "beauty", ''Priscilla'', meaning "police", and ''Hilda (name)|Hilda'' for "hideous". Men, especially other homosexual men, are often referred to by female pronouns in some circles, as is the custom among many homosexual countercultures throughout the world.<ref name=CageQ/><ref name=CageMA/><ref name=CageEvans/>

Gayle arose for the same reason that most antilanguages develop in marginalised communities—to have a secret language in an oppressive society. However it also fulfilled other functions such as to "camp (style)|camp up" conversation, and provide entertainment in a subculture where verbal wit and repartee are highly valued.<ref name=CageQ/><ref name=CageMA/><ref name=CageEvans/>
