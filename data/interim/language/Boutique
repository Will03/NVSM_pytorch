A boutique is "a small store that sells stylish clothing, jewelry, or other usually luxury goods".<ref>cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boutique|website=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary|accessdate=October 1, 2014|title=boutique</ref> The word is French language|French for "shop", which derives ultimately from the Greek language|Greek wikt:ἀποθήκη|ἀποθήκη (''apothēkē'') or "storehouse".<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0096180#m_en_gb0096180 boutique], on Oxford Dictionaries</ref><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29poqh%2Fkh ἀποθήκη], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>

The term "boutique" and also "designer" refer (with some differences) to both goods and services which are containing some element that is claimed to justify an extremely high price, itself called boutique pricing. As with the fine art market, and the use of art in money laundering schemes, national governments have to be concerned with boutique shops and the high pricing of boutique goods as instruments in fraud and other financial schemes.

Etymology and usage
The term "boutique" entered common English parlance in the late 1960s. In Europe, Avenue Montaigne and Bond Street were the focus of much media attention for having the most fashionable stores of the era.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.historypin.org/attach/uid25519/tours/view/id/1921/title/Carnaby%20Street,%201960's%20London.|title=Historypin - Tours - Carnaby Street, 1960s London.|author=Avalith|work=historypin.org</ref>

Some multi-outlet businesses (chains) can be referred to as boutiques if they target small, upscale market niches.<ref>cite web|url=http://jalingo.co/business/selling-clothes-opening-a-boutique-in-nigeria/|title=Starting a Boutique Business|publisher=Jalingo.co|accessdate=August 23, 2015</ref> Although some boutiques specialize in hand-made items and other unique products, others simply produce T-shirts, stickers, and other fashion accessories in artificial scarcity|artificially small runs and sell them at high prices.

Lifestyle
In the late 1990s, some European retail traders developed the idea of tailoring a shop towards a lifestyle theme, in what they called "concept stores",<ref>cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/18/1082226633505.html?from=storyrhs|title=New retailers floor customers|date=April 19, 2004|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2008-10-29</ref> which specialized in cross-selling without using separate departments.
