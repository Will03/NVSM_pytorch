Career
Jacot worked on the first series of the television panel game ''QI''. His research on the show involved him reading an entire Albanian language dictionary and noting down any words which he found interesting.  He noted that there are 27 different words for moustaches and 27 words for eyebrows in Albanian language|Albanian, including, "vetullan" ("very bushy eyebrows"), "vetullor" ("slightly arched eyebrows") and "vetullosh" ("very thick eyebrows"). There was also a question asking the meaning of the word "vetullushe", which was claimed to be "a goat with brown eyebrows".<ref name="QI"/><ref>cite episode|title=Albania|series=QI|serieslink=QI|airdate=30 October 2009|season=1|episode=8</ref><ref>cite book|last=Jacot de Boinod|first=Adam Jacot|title=The Meaning of Tingo|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2005|location=London|pages=19–20|isbn=0-14-102198-5</ref>

After leaving ''QI'', Jacot began an investigation into other languages, examining 280 dictionaries and 140 websites.<ref>Jacot de Boinod, p. ii</ref> This led to the creation of his first book in 2005, ''The Meaning of Tingo'', a book featuring words which have no equivalent in the English language, "Wiktionary:tingo|tingo" being a word from the Pascuense language of Easter Island meaning, "to borrow things from a friend's house, one by one, until there's nothing left".<ref>Jacot de Boinod, p. 95</ref> He then wrote a sequel entitled ''Toujours Tingo'' in 2007. In 2009, Jacot wrote ''The Wonder of Whiffling'', a book about unusual words in English, the word "whiffling" having several meanings, including "one who examined candidates for degrees… an officer who cleared the way for a procession, as well as being the name of the man with the whip in Morris dancing."<ref>cite book|last=de Boinod|first=Adam Jacot|title=The Wonder of Whiffling|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2009|location=London|pages=ix</ref>
