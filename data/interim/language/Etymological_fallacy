The etymological fallacy is a genetic fallacy that holds that the present-day meaning of a word or phrase should necessarily be similar to Semantic change|its historical meaning.cn|date=May 2018  This is a linguistics|linguistic misconception,<ref>Kenneth G. Wilson (1993)  "The Columbia Guide to Standard American English", article "Etymological Fallacy"</ref> and is sometimes used as a basis for linguistic prescription. An argument constitutes an etymological fallacy if it makes a claim about the present meaning of a word based exclusively on its etymology.<ref name="Sihler" />

A variant of the etymological fallacy involves looking for the true meaning of words by delving into their etymologies,<ref>cite book| last =  Hutton| first =  Christopher| title = Linguistics and Third Reich| url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=zJ9YUflEreYC| accessdate = 2010-08-01| series = Routledge studies in the history of linguistics| volume = 1| year = 1998| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-203-02101-9| page = 1| quote = [...] allegedly absurd beliefs such as the etymological 'fallacy' (i.e. the assertion that the true meaning of a word is to be sought in its etymology).</ref> or claiming that a word should be used in a particular way because it has a particular etymology. 

Occurrence and examples

An etymological fallacy becomes possible when a word has Semantic change|changed its meaning over time. Such changes can include a shift in scope (narrowing or widening of meanings) or of connotation (amelioration or pejoration). In some cases, meanings can also shift completely, so that the etymological meaning has no evident connection to the current meaning.<ref name="Sihler">cite book|last=Sihler|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Sihler|title=Language History|series=Amsterdam studies in the theory and history of linguistic science.

Ancient Greeks believed that there was a "true meaning" of a word, distinct from a common use. There is evidence that a similar belief existed among ancient Vedic scholars. In modern days this fallacy may be found in some arguments of language purists.<ref name="Sihler" />

Not every change in meaning leads to an etymological fallacy, but such changes are frequently the basis of inaccurate arguments.

An example of a word which has greatly changed its meaning is ''Decimation_(Roman_army)|decimation'', which originally referred to reduction by a tenth, but now usually means a drastic reduction or complete destruction.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'' ''s.v.'' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/48201 decimation], [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/48200 decimate]</ref> Insisting that only the original meaning is "true" constitutes an etymological fallacy.<ref name="Sihler" />
