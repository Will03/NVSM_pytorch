English is a West Germanic languages|West Germanic language brought around the 5th century CE to the east coast of what is now England by Germanic peoples|Germanic-speaking immigrants from around present-day northern Germany, who came to be known as the Anglo-Saxons. The fusion of these settlers' dialects became what is now termed Old English: the word ''English'' is derived from the name of the Angles. English soon Celtic language-death in England|displaced the previously predominant British Celtic and British Latin throughout most of England. It spread into what was to become south-east Scotland under the influence of the Anglian medieval kingdom of Northumbria. Following the economic, political, military, scientific, cultural, and colonial influence of Great Britain and the United Kingdom from the 18th century, via the British Empire, and of the United States since the mid-20th century, it has been widely dispersed around the world, and become the leading language of international discourse. Many English words are based on roots from Latin, because Latin in some form was the lingua franca of the Christian Church and of European intellectual life. The language was further influenced by the Old Norse language, with Viking invasions in the 8th and 9th centuries. The Norman conquest of England in the 11th century gave rise to heavy borrowings from Norman French, and vocabulary and spelling conventions began to give what had now become Middle English the superficial appearance of a close relationship with Romance languages. The Great Vowel Shift that began in the south of England in the 15th century is one of the historical events marking the separation of Middle and Modern English.

Both the English and Welsh Wales#Languages|languages have official, but not always equal, status in Wales. English has de facto official status everywhere, whereas Welsh has limited, but still considerable, official, de jure, status in only the public service, the judiciary, and elsewhere as prescribed in legislation. The Welsh language is protected by the Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998, and since 1998 it has been common, for example, for almost all British Government Departments to provide both printed documentation and official websites in both English and Welsh.  On 7 December 2010, the National Assembly for Wales unanimously approved a set of measures to develop the use of the Welsh language within Wales.<ref>cite web|title=Policy and legislation|url=http://wales.gov.uk/topics/welshlanguage/policy/?lang=en|work=Welsh Language|publisher=Welsh Government|accessdate=21 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531072241/http://wales.gov.uk/topics/welshlanguage/policy/?lang=en|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all</ref><ref name=bbcnews2010>cite web|title='Historic' assembly vote for new Welsh language law|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11934239|work=BBC News|accessdate=21 November 2013|date=7 December 2010</ref> On 9 February 2011, this measure received Royal Assent and was passed, thus making the Welsh language an official language|officially recognised language within Wales.<ref>cite web|title=Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 |url=http://www.assemblywales.org/bus-home/bus-legislation/bus-leg-measures/business-legislation-measures-wl.htm |work=National Assembly for Wales |accessdate=13 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121033157/http://www.assemblywales.org/bus-home/bus-legislation/bus-leg-measures/business-legislation-measures-wl.htm |archivedate=21 January 2011 |df= </ref>

Based on an alternative definition, there has been a 0.9 percentage point increase when compared with the 2001 census, and an increase of approximately 35,000 in absolute numbers within Wales. Welsh is therefore a growing language within Wales.<ref name="board" /> Of those 553,000 Welsh speakers, 57% (315,000) were considered by others to be fluent, and 477,000 people consider themselves fluent or "fair" speakers. 62% of speakers (340,000) claimed to speak the language daily, including 88% of fluent speakers.<ref name="board" />

However, there is some controversy over the actual number who speak Welsh: some statistics include people who have studied Welsh to General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE standard, many of whom could not be regarded as fluent speakers of the language. Conversely, some first-language speakers may choose not to report themselves as such. These phenomena, also seen with other minority languages outside the UK, make it harder to establish an accurate and unbiased figure for how many people speak it fluently. Furthermore, no question about Welsh language ability was asked in the 2001 census outside Wales, thereby ignoring a considerable population of Welsh speakers – particularly concentrated in neighbouring English counties and in London and other large cities.

Nevertheless, the 2011 census recorded an overall reduction in Welsh speakers, from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011, despite an increase in the size of the population—a 2% drop (from 21% to 19%) in the proportion of Welsh speakers.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-20677528|title=Number of Welsh speakers falling|date=11 December 2012|website=Bbc.co.uk</ref> An estimated 110,000 to 150,000 people in England speak Welsh.<ref name="WelshStatOverview"/><ref>cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/49749c8cc.html |title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - United Kingdom : Welsh |publisher=Minority Rights Group International |year=2008 |accessdate=17 June 2016</ref>

Main|Languages of Scotland
Scottish Gaelic is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish, and thus descends ultimately from Primitive Irish. Outside Scotland, a dialect of the language known as Canadian Gaelic exists in Canada on Cape Breton Island and isolated areas of the Nova Scotia mainland. This variety has around 2000 speakers, amounting to 1.3% of the population of Cape Breton Island.

The United Kingdom Census 2011#2011 Census for Scotland|2011 census of Scotland showed that a total of 57,375 people (1.1% of the Scottish population aged over three years old) in Scotland could speak Gaelic at that time, with the Outer Hebrides being the main stronghold of the language. The census results indicate a decline of 1,275 Gaelic speakers from 2001. A total of 87,056 people in 2011 reported having some facility with Gaelic compared to 93,282 people in 2001, a decline of 6,226.<ref name="2011 Census of Scotland">[http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ods-web/data-warehouse.html 2011 Census of Scotland], Table QS211SC.

The Gaelic language was given official recognition for the first time in Scotland in 2005, by the Scottish Parliament's ''Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005'', which aims to promote the Gaelic language to a status "commanding equal respect" with English. However, this wording has no clear meaning in law, and was chosen to prevent the assumption that the Gaelic language is in any way considered to have "equal validity or parity of esteem with English".<ref>cite journal|last = McLeod|first = Wilson|title = Gaelic in contemporary Scotland: contradictions, challenges and strategies|pages = 7|location = University of Edinburgh |url=http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/gaelic-in-contemporary-scotland-challenges-strategies-and-contradictions(d4353dd1-29f9-4a0c-b9b9-c63552c8fea3)/export.html |accessdate=28 December 2016</ref> A major limitation of the act, though, is that it does not constitute any form of recognition for the Gaelic language by the UK government, and UK public bodies operating in Scotland, as reserved bodies, are explicitly exempted from its provisions.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2005/asp_20050007_en_1#pb5-l1g10 |title=Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 (s.10) |date=1 June 2005 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=25 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907081446/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2005/asp_20050007_en_1 |archivedate= 7 September 2010 |df=dmy </ref>

Scots
The Scots language originated from Northumbrian Old English. The Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria stretched from south Yorkshire to the Firth of Forth from where the Scottish elite continued the language shift northwards. Since there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing languages from dialects, scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots language|Scots. Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects do exist, these often render contradictory results. Focused broad Scots is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with Scottish Standard English at the other. Consequently, Scots is often regarded as one of the ancient varieties of English, but with its own distinct dialects. Alternatively Scots is sometimes treated as a distinct Germanic language, in the way Norwegian language|Norwegian is closely linked to, yet distinct from, Danish language|Danish.

The 2011 UK census was the first to ask residents of Scotland about Scots. A campaign called Aye Can was set up to help individuals answer the question.<ref>Cite web|title=Scottish Census Day 2011 survey begins|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12871752|work=BBC News|accessdate=21 July 2011|date=26 March 2011</ref><ref>Cite web|title=Scots language – Scottish Census 2011|url=http://www.ayecan.com/|work=Aye Can|accessdate=21 July 2011</ref> The specific wording used was "Which of these can you do?

Ulster Scots
2% speak Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots, seen by some as a language distinct from English and by some as a dialect of English, according to the 1999 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey (around 30,000 speakers). Some definitions of Ulster Scots may also include Standard English language|English spoken with an Ulster Scots accent. The language was brought to Ireland by Scotland|Scottish planters from the 16th Century.

Irish Gaelic (Gaeilge)
Irish was the predominant language of the Irish people for most of their recorded history, and they brought their Gaelic speech with them to other countries, notably Scotland and the Isle of Man where it gave rise to Scottish Gaelic and Manx language|Manx.

Cornish language|Cornish (''Kernowek''), a Brythonic Celtic language related to Welsh, was spoken in Cornwall throughout the Middle Ages. Its use began to decline from the 14th century, especially after the Prayer Book Rebellion in 1549. The language continued to function as a first language in Penwith in the far west of Cornwall until the late 18th century. 

A revival initiated by Henry Jenner began in 1903. Since 2002 the Cornish language has been recognised as an historical regional language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.<ref>cite web|title=Cornish gains official recognition|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2410383.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=6 November 2002</ref> The Cornish Language Strategy project commissions research into the Cornish language.

Status

Certain nations and regions of the UK have frameworks for the promotion of their autochthonous languages.

* In Wales, the Welsh Language Act 1993 requires English and Welsh language|Welsh to be treated equally throughout the public sector. This was further enforced through the passing of the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011.<ref>cite web|title=Mesur y Gymraeg (Cymru) 2011|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/mwa/2011/1/enacted/welsh|publisher=UK Legislation|accessdate=21 November 2013|language=Welsh</ref><ref>cite web|title=Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/mwa/2011/1/enacted|publisher=UK Legislation|accessdate=21 November 2013</ref> 
* In Scotland, the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 gave the Scottish Gaelic language its first statutory basis; and the Outer Hebrides|Western Isles region of Scotland has a policy to promote the language.
* In Northern Ireland, Irish language in Northern Ireland|Irish and Ulster Scots language|Ulster Scots enjoy limited use alongside English (mainly in publicly commissioned translations).

The UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of:
*Cornish (in Cornwall)
*Irish and Ulster Scots (in Northern Ireland)
*Scots and Scottish Gaelic (in Scotland)
*Welsh (in Wales)

Under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (which is not legally enforceable, but which requires states to adopt appropriate legal provision for the use of regional and minority languages) the UK government has committed itself to the recognition of certain regional languages and the promotion of certain linguistic traditions. The UK has ratified<ref name=r1>[http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=148&CM=1&DF=&CL=ENG&VL=1 List of declarations made with respect to treaty No. 148], European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, Status as of: 17 March 2011</ref> for the higher level of protection (Section III) provided for by the Charter in respect of Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Irish language|Irish. Cornish language|Cornish, Scots language|Scots in Scotland and Northern Ireland (in the latter territory officially known as Ulster Scots language|Ulster Scots or Ullans, but in the speech of users simply as Scottish or Scots) are protected by the lower level only (Section II). The UK government has also recognised British Sign Language as a language in its own right<ref name=hansard /> of the United Kingdom.

A number of bodies have been established to oversee the promotion of the regional languages: in Scotland, Bòrd na Gàidhlig oversees Scottish Gaelic. Foras na Gaeilge has an all-Ireland remit as a cross-border language body, and Tha Boord o Ulstèr-Scotch is intended to fulfil a similar function for Ulster Scots, although hitherto it has mainly concerned itself with culture. In Wales, the Welsh Language Commissioner (Comisiynydd y Gymraeg) is an independent body established to promote and facilitate use of the Welsh language, mainly by imposing Welsh language standards on organisations.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.comisiynyddygymraeg.cymru/English/Commissioner/Pages/Aim.aspx|title=Comisiynydd y Gymraeg - Aim of the Welsh Language Commissioner|website=Comisiynyddygymraeg.cymru|language=en-us|access-date=25 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402181001/http://www.comisiynyddygymraeg.cymru/English/Commissioner/Pages/Aim.aspx|archive-date=2 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all</ref> The Cornish Language Partnership is a body that represents the major Cornish language and cultural groups and local government's language needs.

Language vs dialect
There are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing ''languages'' from ''dialects'', although a number of paradigms exist, which give sometimes contradictory results. The distinction is therefore a subjective one, dependent on the user's frame of reference.

Scottish Gaelic and Irish language|Irish are generally viewed as being languages in their own right rather than dialects of a single tongue, but they are sometimes mutually intelligible to a limited degree – especially between southern dialects of Scottish and northern dialects of Irish (programmes in these two forms of Gaelic are broadcast respectively on BBC Radio nan Gàidheal and RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta), but the relationship between Scots and English is less clear, since there is usually partial mutual intelligibility.

Since there is a very high level of mutual intelligibility between contemporary speakers of Scots in Scotland and in Ulster (Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots), and a common written form was current well into the 20th century, the two varieties have usually been considered as dialects of a single tongue rather than languages in their own right; the written forms have diverged in the 21st century. The government of the United Kingdom "recognises that Scots and Ulster Scots meet the Charter's definition of a regional or minority language".<ref name=r1/> Whether this implies recognition of one regional or minority language or two is a question of interpretation. Ulster Scots is defined in legislation (The North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999) as: ''the variety of the Scots language which has traditionally been used in parts of Northern Ireland and in Donegal in Ireland''.<ref>cite web|title=Initial Periodical Report by the United Kingdom presented to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Legal_Affairs/Local_and_regional_Democracy/Regional_or_Minority_languages/Documentation/1_Periodical_reports/2002_5e_MIN-LANG_PR_UK.asp|work=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=21 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050514210600/http://www.coe.int/T/E/Legal_Affairs/Local_and_regional_Democracy/Regional_or_Minority_languages/Documentation/1_Periodical_reports/2002_5e_MIN-LANG_PR_UK.asp|archivedate=14 May 2005|date=1 July 2002</ref>

While in continental Europe closely related languages and dialects may get official recognition and support, in the UK there is a tendency to view closely related vernaculars as a single language. Even British Sign Language is mistakenly thought of as a form of 'English' by some, rather than as a language in its own right, with a distinct grammar and vocabulary. The boundaries are not always clear cut, which makes it hard to estimate numbers of speakers.

Hostility
File:Unidentified irish mural.jpg|thumb|Mural in Belfast with Irish language|Irish phrase ''Slán Abhaile'' ("Safe home") directed ironically at departing British Army|British soldiers. In modern Northern Ireland, the Irish language is closely tied with Irish republicanism, despite being used historically by many Protestant and unionist communities.

In Northern Ireland, the use of Irish and Ulster Scots is sometimes viewed as politically loaded, despite both having been used by all communities in the past. According to the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey 1999, the ratio of Unionist to Nationalist users of Ulster Scots is 2:1. About 1% of Catholics claim to speak it, while 2% of Protestants claim to speak it. The disparity in the ratios as determined by political and faith community, despite the very large overlap between the two, reflects the very low numbers of respondents.<ref>cite web|title=1999 Community Relations|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/USPKULST.html|work=Northern Ireland Life & Times|accessdate=21 November 2013</ref> Across the two communities 0% speak it as their main language at home.<ref name=autogenerated1>cite web|title=1999 Community Relations MAINLANG|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/MAINLANG.html|work=Northern Ireland Life & Times|accessdate=21 November 2013</ref> A 2:1 ratio would not differ markedly from that among the general population in those areas of Northern Ireland where Scots is spoken.

Often the use of the Irish language in Northern Ireland has met with the considerable suspicion of Unionists, who have associated it with the largely Catholic Republic of Ireland, and more recently, with the Irish republicanism|republican movement in Northern Ireland itself. Catholic areas of Belfast have street signs in Irish similar to those in the Republic. Approximately 14% of the population speak Irish,<ref>cite web|title=1990 Community Relations USPKIRSH|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/USPKIRSH.html|work=Northern Ireland Life & Times|accessdate=21 November 2013</ref> however only 1% speak it as their main language at home.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Under the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed itself to introducing an Irish Language Act, and it was hoped that a consultation period ending on 2 March 2007 could see Irish becoming an official language, having equal validity with English, recognised as an indigenous language, or aspire to become an official language in the future.<ref>cite web|title=Irish language future is raised|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6177321.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=13 December 2006</ref> However, with the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly in May 2007, responsibility for this was passed to the Assembly, and the commitment was promptly broken. In October 2007, the then Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure|Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Edwin Poots MLA, announced to the assembly that no Irish Language Act would be brought forward. As of April 2016, no Irish Language Act applying to Northern Ireland has been passed, and none is currently planned.

Some resent Scottish Gaelic being promoted in the Lowlands. Gaelic place names are relatively rare in the extreme south-east (that part of Scotland which had previously been under Northumbrian rule)<ref>

(p.482)</ref> and the extreme north-east (part of Caithness, where Norn language|Norse was previously spoken).Citation needed|date=June 2008

Two areas with mostly Norse-derived placenames (and some Pictish), the Northern Isles (Shetland and Orkney) were ceded to Scotland in lieu of an unpaid dowry in 1472, and never spoke Gaelic; its traditional vernacular Norn language|Norn, a derivative of Old Norse mutually intelligible with Icelandic and Faroese, died out in the 18th century after large-scale immigration by Lowland Scots speakers. To this day, many Shetlanders and Orcadians maintain a separate identity, albeit through the Shetlandic and Orcadian dialects of Lowland Scots, rather than their former tongue. Norn was also spoken at one point in Caithness, apparently dying out much earlier than Shetland and Orkney. However, the Old Norse|Norse speaking population were entirely assimilated by the Gaels|Gaelic speaking population in the Western Isles; to what degree this happened in Caithness is a matter of controversy, although Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic was spoken in parts of the county until the 20th century.

Non-recognition
Scots within Scotland and the regional varieties of English within England receive little or no official recognition. The dialects of northern England share some features with Scots that those of southern England do not. The regional dialects of England were once extremely varied, as is recorded in Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright's ''English Dialect Dictionary'' and the Survey of English Dialects, but they have died out over time so that regional differences are now largely in pronunciation rather than in grammar or vocabulary.

Public funding of minority languages continues to produce mixed reactions, and there is sometimes resistance to their teaching in schools. Partly as a result, proficiency in languages other than "Standard" English can vary widely.

Communities migrating to the UK in recent decades have brought many more languages to the country. Surveys started in 1979 by the Inner London Education Authority discovered over 100 languages being spoken domestically by the families of the inner city's school children.

British Asians speak dozens of different languages, and it is difficult to determine how many people speak each language alongside English. The largest subgroup of British Asians are those of Punjabi people|Punjabi origin (representing approximately two thirds of direct migrants from South Asia to the UK), from both India and Pakistan, they number over 2 million in the UK and are the largest Punjabi community outside of South Asia.<ref>cite book|last=Ballard|first=Roger|title=Desh Pardesh: The South Asian Presence in Britain|year=1994|publisher=C Hurst & Co Publishers Ltd |isbn=1850650918 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74ZVFb37zuIC&pg=PA20&d</ref> The Punjabi language is currently the third most spoken language in the UK. Many Black British|Black Britons speak English as their first language. Their ancestors mostly came from West Indies|the West Indies, particularly Jamaica, and generally also spoke English-based creole languages,<ref>cite journal|last1=Bagley |first1=Christopher |last2= |first2= |year=1979 |title=A Comparative Perspective on the Education of Black Children in Britain |journal=Comparative Education |publisher= |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=63–81 |url=http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/947445_751311283_746335513.pdf |doi=10.1080/0305006790150107 dead link|date=March 2017|bot=mediccbignore|bot=medic</ref> hence there are significant numbers of Caribbean creole speakers (see below for Ethnologue figures). With over 300,000 French Briton|French-born people in the UK, plus the general popularity of the language, French is understood by 23% of the country's population.citation needed|date=March 2015 A large proportion of the Black British population, especially African-born immigrants speak French as a first or second language.

The Bengali language|Bengali speaking community in the UK consists of those largely of British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi origin mainly from the Sylhet Division|Sylhet region (predominantly Muslim), and small numbers of British Indian|Indians from the West Bengal region (mainly Hindu). There are around 700,000 Bengali speakers, 550,000 of whom speak Sylheti language|Sylheti,<ref name=ethnologue>cite web|title=United Kingdom|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=GB |work=Ethnologue |publisher=SIL International|accessdate=25 June 2013|year=2013</ref> which is either considered a dialect of Bengali or as a separate language. West Bengalis mainly speak the standard Bengali language, whereas Bangladeshis mainly speak Sylheti, which is generally not written, although children may receive some education in standard Bengali at school. Sylheti is not recognised as a language in Bangladesh, and there some debate to whether it should be recognised as a language separate from Bengali. The Bengali speaking community in the UK is highly concentrated in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.<ref>cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Languages of Europe|year=2000|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0631220398|pages=91–92|editor=Price, Glanville</ref>

Norman French and Latin
File:Wallsend platfom 2 02.jpg|thumb|The signs at Wallsend Metro station are in English and Latin as a tribute to Wallsend's role as one of the outposts of the Roman empire.

Law French|Norman French is still used in the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Houses of Parliament for certain official business between the clerks of the British House of Commons|House of Commons and the House of Lords, and on other official occasions such as the dissolution of Parliament.

Latin is also used to a limited degree in certain official mottoes, for example ''Nemo me impune lacessit'', legal terminology (''habeas corpus''), and various ceremonial contexts. Latin abbreviations can also be seen on British coins. The use of Latin has declined greatly in recent years. However, the Catholic Church retains Latin in official and quasi-official contexts. Latin remains the language of the Roman Rite, and the Tridentine Mass is celebrated in Latin. Although the Mass of Paul VI is usually celebrated in English, it can be and often is said in Latin, in part or whole, especially at multilingual gatherings. It is the official language of the Holy See, the primary language of its public journal, the ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'', and the working language of the Roman Rota.<ref>cite journal|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|title=Pope's Latinist pronounces death of a language|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1540843/Popes-Latinist-pronounces-death-of-a-language.html|journal=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 January 2007|accessdate=16 September 2009|ref=harv</ref>

At one time, Latin and Greek were commonly taught in British schools (and were required for entrance to the ancient universities until 1919, for Greek, and the 1960s, for Latin<ref>cite web|title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 98.6.16|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1998/98.6.16.html|accessdate=21 November 2013</ref>), and A-Levels and Highers are still available in both subjects.

Languages of the Channel Islands and Isle of Man
The Isle of Man and the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey are not part of the UK, but are closely associated with it, being British Crown Dependencies.

For the insular forms of English, see Manx English (Anglo-Manx), Guernsey English and Channel Island English|Jersey English. Forms of French language|French are, or have been, used as an official language in the Channel Islands, e.g. Jersey Legal French.

The indigenous languages of the Crown dependencies are recognised as regional languages by the British and Irish governments within the framework of the British-Irish Council.

=Guernsey=
Guernésiais, a form of French language|French spoken on Guernsey, is related to Norman language|Norman, and Oïl languages|Oïl languages. 14% of the population claim some understanding of the language.

There is intercomprehension (with some difficulty) with Jèrriais-speakers from Jersey and Norman-speakers from mainland Normandy. 
Guernésiais most closely resembles the Norman dialect of La Hague in the Cotentin Peninsula (Cotentinais). The creation of a Guernsey Language Commission was announced on 7 February 2013<ref>cite news|title=Language commission to be formed|url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/news/2013/02/08/language-commission-to-be-formed/|accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=Guernsey Press|date=8 February 2013</ref> as an initiative by government to preserve the linguistic culture. The Commission has operated since Liberation Day, 9 May 2013.

=Jersey=
Jèrriais, a form of French language|French spoken on Jersey, is related to Norman language|Norman and Oïl languages|Oïl languages.

Although Jèrriais is now the first language of a very small minority, until the 19th century it was the everyday language of the majority of the population, and even until the Second World War up to half the population could communicate in the language. The use of Jèrriais is also to be noted during the German occupation of the Channel Islands during the Second World War; the local population used Jèrriais among themselves as a language neither the occupying Germans, nor their French interpreters, could understand. However, the social and economic upheaval of the War meant that use of English increased dramatically after the Liberation. It is considered that the last monolingual adult speakers probably died in the 1950s, although monolingual speaking children were being received into schools in St. Ouen as late as the late 1970s.

The Sercquiais dialect of Sark is descended from Jèrriais, but is not recognised under this framework and the last native speaker died in 2004.citation needed|date=June 2016 Auregnais, the Norman dialect of Alderney, is now extinct.

=Isle of Man=
The Manx language|Manx began to diverge from Early Modern Irish in around the 13th century and from Scottish Gaelic in the 15th. The language sharply declined during the 19th century and was supplanted by English. The UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages on behalf of the Manx government.

Although only a small minority of the Isle of Man's population is fluent in the language, a larger minority has some knowledge of it. Manx is widely considered to be an important part of the island's culture and heritage. Although the last surviving first language|native speaker of the Manx language, Ned Maddrell, died in 1974, the language has never fallen completely out of use. Manx has been the subject of language revival efforts, so that despite the small number of speakers, Manx has become more visible on the island, with increased signage, radio broadcasts and a Manx-medium primary school. The revival of Manx has been aided by the fact that the language was well recorded; for example, the Bible was translated into Manx, and audio recordings were made of native speakers. Its similarity to Irish has also helped its reconstruction. In the 2011 census, 1,823 out of 80,398, or 2.27% of the population, claimed to have knowledge of Manx.<ref name=Gov.im>[http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/treasury/economic/census/census2011reportfinalresized.pdf Isle of Man Census Report 2011] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108113021/http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/treasury/economic/census/census2011reportfinalresized.pdf |date= 8 November 2012 .

Extinct British languages

=Norn=
Main|Norn language

A North Germanic languages|North Germanic once spoken in the Shetland Islands, Orkney Islands and Caithness. The last reports of Norn speakers are claimed to be from the 19th century, but it is more likely that the language was dying out in the late 18th century.<ref>Glanville Price, ''The Languages of Britain'' (London: Edward Arnold 1984, ISBN|978-0-7131-6452-7), p. 203</ref> The remote islands of Foula and Unst are variously claimed as the last refuges of the language in Shetland, where there were people "who could repeat sentences in Norn, probably passages from folk songs or poems, as late as 1893".<ref>Price (1984), p. 204</ref> Walter Sutherland (Norn)|Walter Sutherland from Skaw in Unst, who died about 1850, has been cited as the last native speaker of the Norn language. However, fragments of vocabulary survived the death of the main language and remain to this day, mainly in place-names and terms referring to plants, animals, weather, mood, and fishing vocabulary.

=Pictish=
Main|Pictish language

Pictish was probably a Common Brittonic|Brittonic language, or dialect, spoken by the Picts, the people of northern and central Scotland in the Early Middle Ages, which became extinct c.900 AD. There is virtually no direct attestation of Pictish, short of a limited number of toponymy|geographical and anthroponymy|personal names found on monuments and the contemporary records in the area controlled by the Kingdom of the Picts. Such evidence, however, points to the language being closely related to the Common Brittonic|Brittonic language spoken prior to Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlement in what is now southern Scotland, England and Wales. A minority view held by a few scholars claims that Pictish was at least partially non-Indo-European or that a non-Indo-European and Brittonic language coexisted.

=Cumbric=
Main|Cumbric

Cumbric' was a variety (linguistics)|variety of the Common Brittonic language spoken during the Early Middle Ages in the ''Hen Ogledd'' or "Old North" in what is now Northern England and southern Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scotland.<ref name="CelticCulture">cite book |last= Koch|first= John T.|title= Celtic Culture: a historical encyclopedia| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&pg=PA515&lpg=PP1&vq=515&output=html|publisher= ABC-CLIO|year= 2006|isbn= |pages=515–516</ref> It was closely related to Old Welsh and the other Brittonic languages. Place name evidence suggests Cumbric speakers may have carried it into other parts of northern England as migrants from its core area further north.<ref>James, A. G. (2008): 'A Cumbric Diaspora?' in Padel and Parsons (eds.) ''A Commodity of Good Names: essays in honour of Margaret Gelling, Shaun Tyas'': Stamford, pp. 187–203.</ref> It may also have been spoken as far south as Borough of Pendle|Pendle and the Yorkshire Dales. Most linguists think that it became extinct in the 12th century, after the incorporation of the semi-independent Kingdom of Strathclyde into the Kingdom of Scotland.
