The term multiculturalism has a range of meanings within the contexts of sociology, of political philosophy, and of colloquial use. In sociology and in everyday usage, it is a synonym for "Pluralism (political theory)|ethnic pluralism", with the two terms often used interchangeably, for example, a cultural pluralism in which various ethnic groups collaborate and enter into a dialogue with one another without having to sacrifice their particular identities. It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such as New York City) or a single country within which they do (such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an aboriginal or wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous ethnic group and foreigner ethnic groups are often the focus.

In reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled immigration) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. French Canada and English Canada). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal human migration|migration to and from different jurisdictions around the world (for example, Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain by Angles, Saxons and Jutes in the 5th century or the colonization of the Americas by Europeans, Africans and Asians since the 16th century).

Prevalence
In the political philosophy of multiculturalism, ideas are focused on the ways in which societies are either believed to or should, respond to cultural and religious differences. It is often associated with "identity politics", "the politics of difference", and "the politics of recognition". It is also a matter of economic interests and Power (social and political)|political power.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiculturalism/ Multiculturalism] – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as African Americans, LGBT, with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, indigenous peoples and even the disabled. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate.

Most debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group's culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a melting pot or non-multicultural societies.

The term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western nation-states, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.<ref name="ZarateLevy2011">cite book|author1=Geneviève Zarate|author2=Danielle Levy|author3=Claire Kramsch|title=Handbook of Multilingualism and Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYL4_6SvxewC&pg=PA377|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Archives contemporaines|isbn=978-2-8130-0039-2|page=377</ref>

Many nation-states in Africa, Asia, and the Americas are culturally diverse and are 'multicultural' in a descriptive sense. In some, communalism is a major political issue. The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multiculturalist policies in the Western world, but the historical background is different, and the goal may be a mono-cultural or Monoethnicity|mono-ethnic nation-building – for instance in the Malaysian government's attempt to create a 'Malaysian race' by 2020.<ref>The Economist: ''[http://www.economist.com/surveys/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1677228 The changing of the guard]'', 3 April 2003.</ref>

Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society, that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues.<ref>cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/22/multiculturalism-blame-culture-segregation |title=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |location=London |first=Antony |last=Lerman</ref> They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes.

Historically, support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II, in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the "human rights revolution", in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and ethnic cleansing became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the Holocaust; with the collapse of the Colonial empire|European colonial system, as colonized nations in Africa and Western imperialism in Asia|Asia successfully African independence movements|fought for their independence and pointed out the discriminatory underpinnings of the colonial system; and, in the United States in particular, with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, which criticized ideals of Cultural assimilation|assimilation that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo-American standards and which led to the development of academic ethnic studies programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms.<ref>Susanne Wessendorf, ''The multiculturalism backlash: European discourses, policies and practices'', p. 35; accessed through Google Books, 12 February 2011.</ref><ref>Paul C.

The contact hypothesis in sociology is a well documented phenomenon in which cooperative interactions with those from a different group than one's own reduce prejudice and inter-group hostility.

C. James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it "uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history, particularly the histories of women and minorities [...and] promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten.<ref name="Trotman2002">cite book|author=C.

Tariq Modood argues that in the early years of the 21st century, multiculturalism "is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less", since it is "the form of integration" that (1) best fits the ideal of egalitarianism, (2) has "the best chance of succeeding" in the "post-9/11, post 7/7" world, and (3) has remained "moderate [and] pragmatic".<ref name="Modood2007">cite book|author=Tariq Modood|title=Multiculturalism: a civic idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlEMZuPhpWQC&pg=PA14|year=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-3288-9|page=14</ref>

Bhikhu Parekh counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities "demanding special rights" and to see it as promoting a "thinly veiled racis[m]". Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact "not about minorities" but "is about the proper terms of relationship between different cultural communities", which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., "the principles of justice" must not come from only one of the cultures but must come "through an open and equal dialogue between them."<ref>cite book|last=Parekh|first=Bhikhu C.|title=Rethinking multiculturalism: cultural diversity and political theory|year=2002|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-00995-0|page=13</ref>

People in diverse communities "don’t trust the local mayor, they don’t trust the local paper, they don’t trust other people and they don’t trust institutions," writes Putnam.<ref>cite news |last =Sailer |first = Steve |author-link = Steve Sailer |title = Fragmented future |url = http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/jan/15/00007/ |work = The American Conservative |publisher = Jon Basil Utley |date = 15 January 2007</ref> In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that:

<blockquote>
"[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us".<ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"/></blockquote>

Putnam has also stated, however, that "this allergy to diversity tends to diminish and to go away... I think in the long run we'll all be better."<ref>Martin, Michel, "[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12802663 Political Scientist: Does Diversity Really Work?]" Tell Me More, NPR.

Ethnologist Frank Salter writes:

<blockquote>
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism. For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens. Case studies of the United States, Africa and South-East Asia find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure. Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnies sic. A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogeneous cities.<ref>Salter, Frank, ''On Genetic Interests'', p. 146.</ref>

The Australian historian Keith Windschuttle cited the accounts of his fellow Australian historian Inga Clendinnen of the festival of Ochpaniztli where to honor the Maize Lord a young woman was sacrificed by ripping out her heart so the crops might grow:
<blockquote>Then, still in darkness, silence, and urgent haste, her body was flayed, and a naked priest, a 'very strong man, very powerful, very tall', struggled into the wet skin, with its slack breasts and pouched genitalia: a double nakedness of layered, ambiguous sexuality. The skin of one thigh was reserved to be fashioned into a face-mask for the man impersonating Centeotl, Young Lord Maize Cob, the son of Toci.<ref>Clendinnen, Inga ''Aztecs: An Interpretation'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995. p. 201.</ref></blockquote>

Windschuttle argued that the gruesome religion of the Aztecs that required that dozens of young people be sacrificed and eaten every day so that the sun might rise the next day and hundreds of people sacrificed for major holidays as proving that multiculturalism is a facile doctrine that requires Westerners to respect Aztec religion as equal to any other religion.<ref>Windshuttle, Keith ''The Killing of History How Literary Critics and Social Theorists Are Murdering Our Past'',  San Francisco: Encounter Books, 1997. p. 69.</ref> The American classicist Victor Davis Hanson used the perceived differences in "rationality" between Moctezuma and Cortés to argue that Western culture was superior to every culture in the entire world, which thus led him to reject multiculturalism as a false doctrine that placed all cultures on an equal footing.<ref name="Hanson, Victor Davis 2001. p. 205">Hanson, Victor Davis ''Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise to Western Power'', New York: Random House, 2001. p. 205</ref>

Philosophers, psychologists and historians and early sociologists such as Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, George Santayana, Horace Kallen, John Dewey, W. E. B. Du Bois and Alain Locke developed concepts of cultural pluralism, from which emerged what we understand today as multiculturalism. In ''Pluralistic Universe'' (1909), William James espoused the idea of a "plural society."

 Effect of diversity on civic engagement 
In a 2007 study by Robert D. Putnam|Robert Putnam encompassing 30 000 people across the US found that diversity had a negative effect on civic engagement. The greater the diversity, the fewer people voted, the less they volunteered for community projects and trust among neighbours was only half that of homogenous communities.<ref>Cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/|title=The downside of diversity - The Boston Globe|website=archive.boston.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-31</ref>File:San Carlos de la Barra Fort, Isla de San Carlos, Estado Zulia, Venezuela.jpg|thumb|Bartizan in Venezuela

The European Union is facing unprecedented demographic changes (an aging population, low birth rates, changing family structures and migration). According to the European Commission, it is important, both at EU and national level, to review and adapt existing policies. Following a public debate, a 2006 EU policy paper identified five key policy responses to manage demographic change, among them receiving and integrating migrants into Europe.<ref>cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=502&langId=en|title=Demographic analysis|work=europa.eu</ref>

Historically, Europe has always been a mixture of Latin, Slavic, Germanic, Uralic, Celtic, Hellenic, Illyrian, Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Jewish, Christian, Muslim and other belief systems; although the continent was supposedly unified by the super-position of Imperial Roman Christianity, it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age.<ref name="OstergrenBossé2011">cite book|author1=Robert C. Ostergren|author2=Mathias Le Bossé|title=The Europeans: A Geography of People, Culture, and Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-1fwix23zMC&pg=PA226|date=7 March 2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-384-6|page=226</ref>

In the nineteenth century, the ideology of nationalism transformed the way Europeans thought about the State (polity)|state.<ref name="OstergrenBossé2011" /> Existing states were broken up and new ones created; the new nation-states were founded on the principle that each nation is entitled to its own sovereignty and to engender, protect, and preserve its own unique culture and history. Unity, under this ideology, is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation-state; unity of descent, unity of culture, unity of language, and often unity of religion. The nation-state constitutes a culturally wikt:Homogeneity|homogeneous society, although some national movements recognised regional differences.

Where cultural unity was insufficient, it was encouraged and enforced by the state.<ref name="Kaplan" /> The nineteenth century nation-states developed an array of policies – the most important was compulsory primary education in the national language.<ref name="Kaplan">cite book|author1=Guntram Henrik Herb |author2=David H. Kaplan |title=Nations and Nationalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UoQ-ueHjdEC&pg=PA522|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-907-8|page=522|date=22 May 2008</ref> The language itself was often standardised by a linguistic academy, and regional languages were ignored or suppressed. Some nation-states pursued violent policies of cultural assimilation and even ethnic cleansing.<ref name="Kaplan" />

Some countries in the European Union have introduced policies for "social cohesion", "integration", and (sometimes) "assimilation". The policies include:

* Compulsory courses and/or tests on historiography and nationalism|national history, on the constitution and the legal system (e.g., the computer-based test for individuals seeking naturalisation in the UK named Life in the United Kingdom test)
* Introduction of an official national history, such as the national Canon of Dutch Literature|canon defined for the Netherlands by the Frits van Oostrom|van Oostrom Commission,<ref>cite web|url=http://www.entoen.nu/ |title=Official Web site |publisher=Entoen.nu |accessdate=2010-12-10</ref> and promotion of that history (e.g., by exhibitions about Folk hero|national heroes)
* Tests designed to elicit "unacceptable" values. In Baden-Württemberg, immigrants are asked what they would do if their son says he is a Homosexuality|homosexual (the desired answer is that they would accept it<ref>BBC report at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4655240.stm News.BBC.co.uk], full list of questions in German at [http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&dig=2006/01/04/a0154 TAZ.de]</ref>).

A 2019 report by the Danish Immigration Service and the Ministry of Education (Denmark)|Ministry of Education found that while the second generation non-Western immigrants do better than the first generation, the third generation of immigrants with non-Western background do no better education and employment wise than the second generation. One of the reasons was that second generation immigrants from non-Western countries marry someone from their country of origin and so Danish is not spoken at home which disadvantages children in school. Thereby the process of integration has to start from the beginning for each generation.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.berlingske.dk/content/item/1329273|title=Opråb fra ministre: Problemer med integration af børn af ikkevestlige indvandrere|last=|first=|date=2018-12-16|website=Berlingske.dk|language=da|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-29|quote=Danmarks integrationspolitik har i årtier været bygget op om troen på, at med den rette hjælp vil indvandrere og deres efterkommerne generation for generation falde til.

Sweden was the first country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism in Europe. In May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the social democracy|social democratic government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation. The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies. Despite the anti-multiculturalist protestations of the Sweden Democrats, multiculturalism remains official policy in Sweden.<ref>Cite book|title=The multicultural moment: the history of the idea and politics of multiculturalism in Sweden in comparative, transnational and biographical context, 1964–1975|last=Wickström|first=Mats|publisher=Åbo Akademi|year=2015|isbn=978-952-12-3133-9|location=http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe201501071068|pages=|quote=|via=</ref>

Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government transmigration programs or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions. The Javanese for example, moved from their traditional homeland in Java to the other parts of the archipelago. The expansion of the Javanese and their influence throughout Indonesia has raised the issue of Javanization, although Minangkabau people|Minangkabau, Malay Indonesian|Malay, Madurese, Bugis and Makassar people, as a result of their ''merantau'' (migrating) culture are also quite widely distributed throughout the Indonesian archipelago, while Chinese Indonesians can be found in most urban areas. Because of urbanization, major Indonesian cities such as Greater Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Palembang, Medan and Makassar have attracted large numbers of Indonesians from various ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. Jakarta in particular has almost all Indonesian ethnic groups represented.

However, this transmigration program and close interactions between people of different cultural backgrounds caused socio-cultural problems, as the inter-ethnics interactions have not always been conducted harmoniously. After the Post-Suharto era|fall of Suharto in 1998 into the 2000s, numbers of inter-ethnic and inter-religious clashes erupted in Indonesia.

As the looting and destruction took place, a number of Chinese Indonesians, as well as looters, were killed. The Chinese Indonesians were treated as the scapegoat of 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, a result of ongoing discrimination and segregation policies enforced during Suharto's New Order regime. Soon after the fourth Indonesian President, Abdurrahman Wahid came into power in 1999, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to promote acceptance and to improve inter-racial relationships, such as abolishing the ban on Chinese culture; allowing Chinese traditions to be practised freely.

Several regions in the then British Malaya such as Penang, Malacca and Singapore became Chinese dominated. Until the riots 1969, co-existence between the three ethnicities (and other minor groups) was largely peaceful, although the three main racial groups for the most part lived in separate communities – the Malays in the villages, the Chinese in the urban areas, and the Indians in the towns and plantation. More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of institutionalized discrimination.<ref>cite news |url=http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&catid=198:helen-ang&Itemid=156 |title=Honey, I shrunk the Chinese! |publisher=CPI |date=9 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525132129/http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&catid=198:helen-ang&Itemid=156 |archivedate=25 May 2012 |df= </ref>

Preceding independence of the Federation of Malaya, a social contract (Malaysia)|social contract was negotiated as the basis of a new society. The contract as reflected in the Constitution of Malaysia|1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship, and Malays' special rights are guaranteed. This is often referred to the Bumiputra policy.

These Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties, who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights. The issue is sometimes related to the controversial status of religious freedom in Malaysia.

=Singapore=
Because of immigration, Singapore has a Chinese majority population with significant minority populations of Malay people|Malays and Indians (predominantly Tamil people|Tamils). Other prominent smaller groups include Peranakans, Eurasians in Singapore|Eurasians and Europeans. Besides English Language|English, Singapore recognizes three other languages—Malay language|Malay, Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese and Tamil language|Tamil. English was established as the medium of instruction in schools during the 1960s and 1970s and is the language of trade and government while the other three languages are taught as second languages ("mother tongues"). Besides being a multilingualism|multilingual country, Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by the three main ethnic communities.

During British colonial rule, ethnic enclaves such as Geylang, Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown, and Little India, Singapore|Little India were enforced. Presently <sup>(2010)</sup>, remnants of colonial ethnic concentration still exist but housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy, which ensures an even ethnic distribution throughout Singapore.<ref>(n.d.)

However, the word "multiculturalism" is increasingly heard in South Korea. In 2007, Han Geon-Soo, Professor of Cultural Anthropology at Kangwon National University, published an article entitled "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", noting: "As the increase of foreign migrants in [South] Korea transforms a single-ethnic homogeneous [South] Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one, [the South] Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement." He argued, however, that "the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in [South] Korea" lacked "the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society".<ref>Han Geon-Soo, "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", ''Korea Journal'', Vol. 47 No. 4, Winter 2007, pp. 32–63</ref>

The same year, Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued:
:"Korea no longer has to decide whether it wants to become a multicultural society. It made that decision years ago – perhaps unconsciously – when it decided to be a full participant in the emerging global economy. It confirmed that decision when it decided to actively recruit foreign migrants to meet the economic and demographic needs of a fast-growing society. Korea is faced by a different decision today: what type of multicultural society does it want to be?"<ref>Stephen Castles, [http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf "Will Labour Migration lead to a Multicultural Society in Korea?", Global Human Resources Forum 2007 / International Migration Institute] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725111757/http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf |date=25 July 2011 </ref>

The ''Korea Times'' suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society.<ref>[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/10/123_57884.html "Multiculturalism Likely to Prevail in Korea"], Lee Hyo-sik, ''Korea Times'', 24 December 2009</ref> In 2010, an opinion editorial written by Peter Underwood for the ''JoongAng Ilbo'' stated: "Media in [South] Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism. With more than one million foreigners in [South] Korea, 2 percent of the population comes from other cultures." He further opined:
:"If you stay too long, Koreans become uncomfortable with you. [...] Having a two percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea’s greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad. Multiculturalism will introduce contrasting views and challenge existing assumptions. While it will undermine the homogeneity, it will enrich Koreans with a better understanding of themselves."<ref>Cite web|last=Underwood |first=Peter |date=26 August 2010 |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925120 |title=Multiculturalism in Korea |work=JoongAng Ilbo |location=South Korea |publisher=JoongAng Ilbo |accessdate=2 September 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902022520/http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925120 |archivedate=2 September 2010 </ref>

 Indigenous Peoples' Rights 
Although native to Cameroonian land, they faced constant discrimination much like other indigenous groups around the world. The United Nations General Assembly (United Nations General Assembly|UNGA) adopted the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) in 2007. What this allowed was the protection of land and resource rights and prevented others from wiktionary:Exploitation|exploiting or violating them.<ref>Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1 December 2017|title=Indigenous peoples’ land rights in Cameroon: progress to date and possible futures|url=http://pubs.iied.org/17448IIED/|journal=Briefing|volume=|pages=|via=</ref> In 2016, a group of indigenous Baka and Bagyeli groups united to form Gbabandi. Gbabandi allowed these indigenous groups to have a form of representation and a declared list of requirements that people of Cameroon had to abide by. Among these requirements were guaranteed land rights, peoples' consent to the usage of their sacred land, traditional chiefs and the ability to participate in "local, regional, and national levels" of political and economic matters. As a result, this established a sense of justice and acknowledgment among indigenous groups in Cameroon and posed for future battles for indigenous peoples' rights.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/rights-land-natural-resources/news-article/2017/declaration-land-rights-gbabandi-platform-cameroon|title=Declaration on land rights from the Gbabandi Platform, Cameroon !
