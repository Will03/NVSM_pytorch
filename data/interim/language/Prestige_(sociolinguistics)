Sociolinguistics
Prestige is the level of regard normally accorded a specific language or dialect within a speech community, relative to other languages or dialects. The concept of prestige in sociolinguistics provides one explanation for the phenomenon of variation in form, among speakers of a language or languages.<ref>harvnb|Eckert|Rickford|2002|pp=2–4, 24, 260–263</ref> Prestige varieties are those varieties which are generally considered, by a society, to be the most "correct" or otherwise superior variety. The prestige variety, in many cases, is the standard language|standard form of the language though there are exceptions, particularly in situations of covert prestige where a non-standard dialect is highly valued.

Sociolinguistic prestige is especially visible in situations where two or more distinct languages are in use, and in Multiculturalism|diverse, socially stratified urban areas, in which there are likely to be speakers of different languages and/or dialects interacting frequently.

The prevailing view among contemporary linguists is that regardless of perceptions that a dialect or language is "better" or "worse" than its counterparts, when dialects and languages are assessed "on purely linguistics|linguistic grounds, all languages—and all dialects—have equal merit".<ref name="on_language">harvnb|Fox|1999</ref><ref>harvnb|O'Grady et al.|2001|p=7</ref><ref>harvnb|Fasold|Connor-Linton|2006|p=387</ref>

Standard varieties and covert prestige
main|Standard language
Prestige varieties are those that are regarded mostly highly within a society. As such, the standard language, the form promoted by authorities and considered "correct" or otherwise superior, is often the prestige variety. However, there are many exceptions to this rule, such as Arabic language|Arabic, in which Egyptian Arabic is widely used in mass media aimed at international audiences, while Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic (also known as Standard Arabic) is a more prestigious form.<ref name="Ibrahim 1986, p. 115">harvnb|Ibrahim|1986|p=115</ref><ref>harvnb|Jenkins|2001|p=205</ref><ref>harvnb|Haeri|2003</ref> Prestige varieties do not exhibit features, grammatically speaking, which prove them superior in terms of logic, efficacy or aesthetics.<ref>harvnb|Preston|1996|pp=40–74</ref> They are the language varieties of the prestigious social classes.<ref name="Labov" /> Therefore, the prestige variety of a given language community or nation-state has symbolic significance and may act as an instrument of political power.

The notion of a "standard" language in a speech community is related to the prestige of the languages spoken in the community. In general, "greater prestige tends to be attached to the notion of the standard, since it can function in higher domains, and has a written form."<ref>harvnb|Leith|1997|p=8</ref> While there are some counterexamples, such as Arabic, "prestigious and standard varieties [tend to] coincide to the extent that the two terms can be used interchangeably."<ref name="Ibrahim 1986, p. 115"/>

In countries like the United States, where citizens speak many different languages and come from a variety of nationality|national and ethnic groups, there is a "folk linguistics|folk linguistic" belief that the most prestigious dialect is the single standard dialect of English language|English that all people should speak.<ref>harvnb|Niedzielski|Preston|2003|p=44</ref> Linguist Rosina Lippi-Green believes that this belief in a standard language justifies and rationalizes the preservation of the social order, since it equates "nonstandard" or "substandard" language with "nonstandard or substandard human beings."<ref name="on_language" /> Linguists believe that no language, or variety (linguistics)|variety of language, is inherently better than any other language, for every language serves its purpose of allowing its users to communicate.<ref>harvnb|Wardhaugh|2006|p=335</ref>

The terms and conditions of prestige assigned to a language variety are subject to change depending on speaker, situation and context. A dialect or variety which is considered prestigious in one context, will not carry the same status in another.<ref name="Trudgill" /> The relative status of language varieties according to audience, situation and other contextual elements is highly local. Covert prestige refers to relatively high value placed on a non-standard form of language.<ref>harvnb|Labov|2006|p=58</ref>

Causes
Different languages and dialects are accorded prestige based upon factors, including "rich literary heritage, high degree of language modernization, considerable international standing, or the prestige of its speakers".<ref>harvnb|Kloss|1966|pp=143–144</ref> These attributes and factors contribute to how the language is viewed as being of high prestige, leaving a language or dialect with few or none of these attributes to be considered to be of low prestige. 

"Language is intertwined with culture," therefore there is often a strong correlation between the prestige of a group of people and the prestige accorded to the language they speak, as <ref>harvnb|Kahane|1986|p=498</ref> Linguist Laurie Bauer's description of Latin's prestige exemplifies this phenomenon: cquote|The prestige accorded to the churchmen, lawyers and scholars who used Latin was transferred to the language itself. Latin was held to be noble and beautiful, not just the thoughts expressed in it or the people who used it. What is called 'beauty' in a language is more accurately seen as a reflection of the prestige of its speakers.<ref>harvnb|Bauer|1998|pp=132–137</ref>

This phenomenon is not limited to English-speaking populations. In Western Europe, multiple languages were considered to be of high prestige at some time or another, including "Italian language|Italian as the Mediterranean ''lingua franca'' and as the language of the Renaissance; and the 17th-18th century French language|French of the noble court|court culture".<ref>harvnb|Kahane|1986|p=495</ref>

Walt Wolfram, a professor of linguistics at North Carolina State University, notes that he "can't think of any situations in the United States where low-prestige groups have high-prestige language systems".<ref name="on_language"/>

Language attitudes
Further|Dialect
Prestige influences whether a variety (linguistics)|language variety is considered a language or a dialect. In discussing definitions of language, Dell Hymes wrote that "sometimes two communities are said to have the same, or different, languages on the grounds of mutual intelligibility, or lack thereof", but alone, this definition is often insufficient.<ref>harvnb|Hymes|1971|pp=47–92</ref>

Different language varieties in an area exist along a dialect continuum, and moving geography|geographically often means a change in the local variety.

This continuum means that despite the fact that standard German and standard Dutch are not mutually intelligible, the speech of people living near the border between Germany and the Netherlands will more closely resemble that of their neighbors across the border than the standard languages of their respective home countries. Even so, speakers near the border would describe themselves as speaking a variety of their respective standard languages, and the evolution of these dialects tends to mirror that of the standard languages as well.<ref>harvnb|Trudgill|1992|p=169</ref><ref>harvnb|Wardhaugh|2006|p=31</ref>

That they are classified as such reflects the fact that "language differences are not only marks of differential group membership, but also powerful triggers of group attitudes".<ref>harvnb|Haugen|1966b|p=297</ref> Such fuzziness has resulted in the aphorism "A language is a dialect with an army and a navy." That is, speakers of some language variety with political and social power are viewed as having a distinct language, while "'dialect' is [...] a term that suggests lower-class or rural speech".<ref>harvnb|Haugen|1966a|p=924</ref>

A wikt:canonical|canonical example of this is the North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages, including Danish language|Danish, Swedish language|Swedish, and Norwegian language|Norwegian, where language differences "constitute barriers to but do not wholly block communication", but are considered distinct languages because they are spoken in different country|countries.<ref>harvnb|Haugen|1966b|p=281</ref>

=Social class=
While some differences between dialects are regional in nature, there are also social causes for differences in dialects. Very often, the "public prestige dialect of the elite in a stratified community differs from the dialect(s) of the non-elite strata (working class and other)".<ref>harvnb|Kroch|1978|p=17</ref> In fact, in an article which in part tried to motivate the study of sociolinguistics, Raven McDavid wrote that "the importance of language as a mirror of culture can be demonstrated by dialect differences in American English".<ref>harvnb|McDavid|1946||p=168</ref> Thus the relation between the way speakers use a language and their social status is a long recognized tool in sociolinguistics.

In 1958, one of the earliest studies of the relationship between social differences and dialect differences was published by John Gumperz, who studied the speech patterns in Khalapur, a small, highly stratified village in India. In all, the village has 31 castes, ranging from Brahmins and Rajputs at the top, to Chamars and Bhangis at the bottom, and 90% of the overall population was Hindu, with the remaining 10% Muslim.<ref>harvnb|Gumperz|1958|p=670</ref>

Gumperz observed that the different castes were distinguished both phonology|phonologically and word|lexically, with each caste having a vocabulary specific to their subculture.<ref>harvnb|Gumperz|1958|p=675</ref> Remarkably, the speech differences between Hindus and Muslims "are of the same order as those between individual touchable castes and certainly much less important than the variation between touchables and untouchables".<ref name="Gumperz">harvnb|Gumperz|1958|p=676</ref>

Gumperz also observed that the lower prestige groups sought to imitate the higher prestige speech patterns and that over time, it had caused the sociocultural evolution|evolution of the prestige away from the regional standard, as higher prestige groups sought to differentiate themselves from lower prestige groups.<ref name="Gumperz" /> He concluded that in determining speech patterns in this community, "the determining factor seems to be informal friendship contacts" rather than work contacts.<ref>harvnb|Gumperz|1958|p=681</ref>

One notable example of the relationship between dialect and social stratification in English is William Labov's 1966 study of the Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|variable pronunciation of ''r'' in New York City. Labov went to three New York City department stores that catered to three clearly delineated socioeconomic groups—Saks Fifth Avenue|Saks (high), Macy's (middle), and S. Klein (low)—and studied how their employees pronounced the phrase "fourth floor". His results demonstrated that the employees at Saks pronounced ''r'' most often, Macy's employees pronounced ''r'' less often, and at S. Klein, seventy-nine percent of the respondents said no ''r'' at all. Another trend Labov noticed was that at all three of the stores, but Macy's in particular, when prompted to say "fourth floor" a second time, employees were much more likely to pronounce the ''r''.<ref>harvnb|Wardhaugh|2006|p=164</ref>

Labov attributed his findings to the perceived prestige of each dialect. He noted that New York City's "dropped 'r' has its origins in posh British speech", but after World War II, "with the loss of Britain's imperial status 'r'-less British speech ceased to be regarded as 'prestige speech'".<ref>harvnb|Seabrook|2005</ref> In 1966, when Labov performed his study, pronouncing words like ''car'' and ''guard'' with ''r'' was then considered an element of prestige speech.<ref>harvnb|Wardhaugh|2006|p=165</ref> This resulted in middle-class employees, once made conscious of having to pronounce "fourth floor", altering their pronunciation in order to match that of the high prestige dialect. The prestige given to ''r'' was also evident in the hypercorrection observed in lower-class speech. Knowing that ''r''-pronunciation was a prestigious trait, many of the lower-class speakers in another Labov study—in which speakers were asked to read from word lists—added ''-r'' to words that did not have an ''r'' at all. The difference between this study and the "fourth floor" study was the fact that speakers were closely monitoring their speech, not speaking spontaneously, and were thus careful to add ''r'' in an attempt to mimic a higher social class.<ref>harvnb|Wardhaugh|2006|p=167</ref>

=Gender and covert prestige=
Further|Language and gender
Non-standard dialects are usually considered low-prestige, but in some situations dialects "stigmatized by the education system still enjoy a ''covert'' prestige among working-class men for the very reason that they are considered incorrect".<ref>harvnb|Leith|1997|p=96</ref> These situations occur when the speaker wants to gain recognition, acceptance, or Social solidarity|solidarity with a specific—and non-prestigious—group of people, or to signal to other speakers their identification with that group.<ref>harvnb|Chambers|1998|p=85</ref> The idea of covert prestige was first introduced by William Labov, who noticed that even speakers who used non-standard dialects often believed that their own dialect was "bad" or "inferior". Labov realized that there must be some underlying reason for their use of the dialect, which he identified as a signal of group identity.<ref name="Labov">harvnb|Labov|2006|p=85</ref> One example is a 1998 study on the use of word-final ''-ing'' versus ''-in'' among college Fraternities and sororities|fraternity men in the United States. The fraternity men used "-in" rather than "-ing," from which the author concluded that the men used ''-in'' to demonstrate what they saw as working-class behavioral traits, such as 'hard-working' and 'casual,' thus creating a specific identity for themselves.<ref>harvnb|Kiesling|1998|p=94</ref>

Likewise, in studies of the speech patterns in British English, Peter Trudgill observed that more working class women spoke the standard dialect than men.<ref>harvnb|Trudgill|1972|p=179</ref> Farida Abu-Haidar performed a similar study in Baghdad of prestige in the Arabic language, after which she concluded that in Baghdadi Arabic, women are more conscious of prestige than are men.<ref>harvnb|Abu-Haidar|1989|p=471</ref> Other areas in which this has been observed include New Zealand and Guangdong in China.<ref>harvnb|Gordon|1997|p=47</ref><ref>harvnb|Wang|2008|p=57</ref> As explanation, Trudgill suggests that for men, there is covert prestige associated with speaking the working class dialect.<ref name="Trudgill">harvnb|Trudgill|1972|p=194</ref> In fact, he observed men claiming to speak a ''less'' prestigious dialect than that which they actually spoke. According to this interpretation then, "women's use of prestige features simply conforms to the ordinary sociolinguistic order, while men deviate from what is expected."<ref>harvnb|Fasold|1990|p=117</ref> Elizabeth Gordon, in her study of New Zealand, suggested instead that women used higher prestige forms because of the association of human female sexuality|sexual immorality with lower-class woman|women.<ref>harvnb|Gordon|1997|p=48</ref> Whatever the cause, women across many cultures seem more likely than men to modify their speech towards the prestige dialect.

Though women use prestige dialects more frequently than do men, the same gender preference for prestige languages does not seem to exist. A study of diglossia|diglossic societies by John Angle and Sharlene Hesse-Biber showed that the men were more likely to speak the prestige language than were women.<ref name="angle">harvnb|Angle|Hesse-Biber|1981|p=449</ref> One explanation put forth for this is that men are more likely to have the means of acquiring a second language than are women.

Language contact
When different languages or language varieties come in contact with one another, a variety of relationships can form between the two, all typically influenced by prestige. When the two contact languages have equal power or prestige, they form Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|adstratum, as exemplified by Old English and Old Norse|Norse, which shared elements with each other more or less equally.

Far more common is for the two languages to have an unequal power relationship, as is the case of many colonial language contact situations. Languages that have a higher status in relation to a certain group often manifest themselves in loanword|word borrowing. One example is in English, which features a large number of words borrowed from French, as a result of the historical prestige of French. Another potential result of such contact relationships includes the creation of a pidgin or eventually creole language|creole through nativization. In the case of pidgins and creoles, it is usually noted that the low prestige language provides the phonology while the high prestige language provides the lexicon and grammar|grammatical structure.

In addition to forming of a new language, known as a creole, language contact can result in changes to the languages in contact, such as language convergence, language shift or language death. Language convergence is when two languages have been exposed for a long period of time and they begin to have more properties in common. Language shift is when a speaker shifts from speaking a lower prestige dialect to a higher prestige dialect. Language death is when speakers of a language die off, and there are no new generations learning to speak this language. The intensity of the contact between the two languages and their relative prestige levels influence the degree to which a language experiences lexical borrowing and changes to the morphology (linguistics)|morphology, phonology, syntax, and overall structure of the language.<ref>harvnb|Winford|2003</ref>

Language structure
Further|Diglossia
When two languages with an asymmetrical power relationship come into contact, such as through colony|colonization or in a refugee situation, the creole that results is typically largely based on the prestige language; as noted above, linguists have observed that the low-prestige language usually provides the phonology while the high-prestige language provides the lexicon and grammatical structure. Over time, continued contact between the creole and the prestige language may result in decreolization, in which the creole begins to more closely resemble the prestige language. Decreolization thus creates a post-creole continuum|creole continuum, ranging from an acrolect (a version of the creole that is very similar to the prestige language), to mesolects (decreasingly similar versions), to the basilect (the most “conservative" creole). An example of decreolization described by Hock and Joseph is African American Vernacular English (AAVE), in which older, more conservative versions preserve feature (linguistics)|features such as the perfective aspect|completive marker ''done'' while newer, less conservative versions do not.<ref>harvnb|Hock|Joseph|1996|p=443</ref>

Some instances of contact between languages with different prestige levels have resulted in diglossia, a phenomenon in which a community uses a high prestige language or dialect in certain situations, usually for newspapers, in literature, on campus|university campuses, for religious ceremonies, and on television and the radio, but uses a low prestige language or dialect for other situations, often in conversation in the home or in letter (message)|letters, comic strips, and in popular culture. Linguist Charles A. Ferguson's 1959 article "Diglossia" listed the following examples of diglossic societies: in the Middle East and North Africa, Standard Arabic and vernacular Arabics; in Greece, Katharevousa and Dhimotiki; in Switzerland, Swiss Standard German and Swiss German; and in Haiti, Standard French and Haitian Creole.<ref>harvnb|Ferguson|1959</ref> In most African countries, a European language serves as the official, prestige language (Standard French, English language|English, Portuguese language|Portuguese), while local languages (Wolof language|Wolof, Bambara language|Bambara, Yoruba language|Yoruba) or creoles (Ivorian French, Nigerian English) serve as everyday languages of communication.

In diglossic societies, the prestigious language tends to be very conservative and resist change over time while the low-prestige language, the local vernacular, undergoes normal language change. For instance, Latin, the high prestige language of Europe for many centuries, underwent minimal change while the everyday low prestige languages which were spoken evolved significantly. If, however, the two languages are spoken freely, the prestige language may undergo vernacularization and begin to incorporate vernacular features. An example is Sanskrit, an ancient prestige language that has incorporated the vernacular pronunciations of IPAblink|tʃ and IPA|[b] for word-initial ''y-'' and ''v-''.<ref>harvnb|Hock|1996|p=340</ref>

The prestige language may also change under the influence of specific regional dialects in a process known as regionalisation|regionalization. For example, in medieval times, Ecclesiastical Latin developed different forms in various countries where it was used, including Italy, France, Portugal, Spain, as well as other Roman Catholic nations, notably in pronunciation – see Latin regional pronunciation. Some of these differences were minor, such as ''c'' before ''i'' and ''e'' being pronounced IPA|[tʃ] in Italy but IPA|[s] in France, but after English underwent the Great Vowel Shift between 1200 and 1600, the vowel system in England became nearly unrecognizable to its European ecclesiastic counterparts.<ref>harvnb|Hock|1996|p=341</ref>
