Etiquette in Europe is not uniform.  Even within the regions of Europe, etiquette may not be uniform: within a single country there may be differences in Norm (sociology)|customs, especially where there are different linguistic groups, as in Switzerland where there are French language|French, German language|German and Italian language|Italian speakers.<ref name=PiE>cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h6abwB15Q0C|title=Politeness in Europe|author=Leo Hickey, Miranda Stewart|year=2005|isbn=1-85359-737-6</ref>

Despite this heterogeneity, many points of etiquette have spread through Europe and many features are shared. The ancient Roman Empire is a historical source, and the cosmopolitan royalty and also nobility were effective in spreading etiquette throughout Europe. For example, in the Palace of Versailles, where French nobility was concentrated, a complicated etiquette was developed.

Language and forms of address

It is never acceptable to write an anonymous letter or one that purports to be signed by somebody other than the writer (but does not make that clear).

Many languages use different 2nd person pronouns to denote formality or familiarity when addressing people (the T–V distinction). This also applies in common phrases such as "How are you?".<ref>Hervey Sandor, Ian Higgins, Sandor G J Hervey. (2002) ''Thinking French Translation'', Routledge (UK). p. 46. ISBN|0-415-25522-8.</ref> The use of an inappropriately familiar form may be seen as derogatory, insulting or even aggressive. Conversely, forms that are inappropriately formal may be seen as impolitely snobbish<ref>Michel Walter Pharand. (2001) ''Bernard Shaw and the French'', University Press of Florida. p. 113. ISBN|0-8130-1828-5.</ref> or distant.

The way politeness is expressed varies greatly with language and region. For example, addressing a person with an honorific or title may be expected in some languages, but seen as intrusive or too formal in others.

In many parts of Europe, using someone's first name also denotes a certain level of friendship. In social interactions with strangers, the last name and/or more formal mode of address is used, usually until the people involved agree to move to an informal level. However, this may not apply among young people, among members of particular groups (e.g. students) or in informal settings. Also among countries that border each other vast differences can be noticed in the use of titles, first names and pronouncesclarifyme|date=January 2017, as is the case in the Netherlands compared with Belgium and Germany.<ref name="1,2122,,00.html">[http://www.dhl-usa.com/usgov/isr/culture/1,2122,,00.html Cultural Tips] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527233457/http://www.dhl-usa.com/usgov/isr/culture/1,2122,,00.html |date=May 27, 2007 </ref>

In some countries, such as in Italy, chrysanthemums are given only at funerals. In France, red roses are given to the beloved person when the giver is in love.<ref> [Mitschke & Tano (2011).

Hats and coats
Among many segments of the European population, for example, in the United Kingdom, it is considered impolite to wear a hat or other head covering indoors, especially in churches, schools, private homes and respected public institutions. In churches, however, ladies may be exempt from this rule.

Wearing coats, boots or other outer garments inside someone’s home is often frowned upon as well.  Sitting down to eat at table wearing a hat or coat etc. is even worse. Also one should remove one's hat when showing deference. Removing one's hat is also a form of respectful greeting: the origin of this is that knights were expected to remove their helmets when meeting their king; not doing so would be a sign of mistrust and hostility.<ref>Turunen, Ari, Partanen, Markus. Uusi ulkokultaisen käytöksen kirja. Atena, Jyväskylä, 2007. S. 34.</ref>

Money
Talking or asking about one's personal wealth, possessions or success in business is widely viewed as vulgar. People will rarely say how much money they make or have in the bank nor will they request such information from someone else. It is impolite to ask colleagues about their salary and in some places of work it is forbidden.<ref name="loonzakje">[http://www.loonwijzer.be/index.php?pid=85 De Belg laat niet graag in zijn loonzakje kijken] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110231257/http://www.loonwijzer.be/index.php?pid=85 |date=2006-11-10 </ref> Even elsewhere, for example where government employees' salaries are publicly known, it is still considered extremely rude to ask individuals how much they earn.

Exposure
In Europe, what qualifies as indecent exposure includes generally at least the exposure of genitalia or anus. In case of women, exposing nipples is not seen as proper conduct, but this is not always considered criminal, and depends on individual countries' nudity laws. For the issue of breastfeeding babies in public, see ''Breastfeeding in public''. The intentional exposure of bare buttocks towards someone, mooning, is a deliberate insult. However, public nudity may be allowed in some circumstances, which vary by country. Within Dutch society nudity is less sexualized as in for example the English-speaking world and resembles more the views of other Northern European cultures, as can be seen in the Sauna in the Dutch language area|sauna customs. In saunas, the rules about nudity vary according to the country. On nudist beaches, multigender saunas and in the changing rooms of swimming pools in some countries, keeping one's clothes on is frowned upon. Here it is good manners to undress.
