The Lucien Stryk Asian Translation Prizes|Lucien Stryk Asian Translation Prize is awarded at the same time as the NTA by the ALTA and recognizes the best translation into English of book-length texts of Asian poetry or Zen Buddhism.

Both awards are announced and honored at the annual ALTA conference held each fall.
