The Battle of  Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater of World War II that took place between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Empire of Japan|Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea.<ref name="NavalHistory2015">cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/b/battle-of-midway-4-7-june-1942.html|title=Battle of Midway: June 4–7, 1942|date=26 March 2015|publisher=Naval History & Heritage Command|accessdate=15 June 2016</ref><ref>harvnb|Dull|1978|p=166</ref><ref name="Midway Decisive">cite web|url=http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/midway.html|title=A Brief History of Aircraft Carriers: Battle of Midway|year=2007|work=|publisher=U.S. Navy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612040835/http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/midway.html|archivedate=12 June 2007|accessdate=12 June 2007</ref> The United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz, Frank Jack Fletcher, and Raymond A. Spruance defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto, Chūichi Nagumo, and Nobutake Kondō near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. Military historian John Keegan called it "the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare".<ref>harvnb|Keegan|2005|p=275</ref>

The Japanese operation, like the earlier attack on Pearl Harbor, sought to eliminate the United States as a strategic power in the Pacific, thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Japanese hoped another demoralizing defeat would force the U.S. to capitulate in the Pacific War and thus ensure Japanese dominance in the Pacific. Luring the American aircraft carriers into a trap and occupying Midway was part of an overall "barrier" strategy to extend Japan's defensive perimeter, in response to the Doolittle Raid|Doolittle air raid on Tokyo. This operation was also considered preparatory for further attacks against Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii itself.

The plan was handicapped by faulty Japanese assumptions of the American reaction and poor initial dispositions. Most significantly, Station HYPO|American cryptographers were able to determine the date and location of the planned attack, enabling the forewarned U.S. Navy to prepare its own ambush. Four Japanese and three American aircraft carriers participated in the battle. All four of Japan's large <!--I'd prefer "fleet carrier", but it's ambiguous in context-->fleet carriers—ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2, ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2, ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sōryū||2 and ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiryū||2, part of the Order of battle of the Attack on Pearl Harbor|six-carrier force that had attacked Pearl Harbor six months earlier—and a Japanese cruiser Mikuma|heavy cruiser were sunk, while the U.S. lost the carrier USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2 and a USS Hammann (DD-412)|destroyer.

After Midway and the exhausting attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's capacity to replace its losses in materiel (particularly aircraft carriers) and men (especially well-trained pilots and maintenance crewmen) rapidly became insufficient to cope with mounting casualties, while the United States' massive industrial and training capabilities made losses far easier to replace. The Battle of Midway, along with the Guadalcanal Campaign, is widely considered a turning point in the Pacific War.

Background
File:Japanese expansion april 1942.svg|thumb|550px|The extent of Japanese military expansion in the Pacific, April 1942
After expanding the war in the Pacific to include Western outposts, the Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire had attained its initial strategic goals quickly, taking the Philippines, British Malaya|Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia); the latter, with its vital oil resources, was particularly important to Japan. Because of this, preliminary planning for a second phase of operations commenced as early as January 1942.

There were strategic disagreements between the Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army (IJA) and Imperial Navy (IJN), and infighting between the Navy's Imperial General Headquarters|GHQ and Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku|Isoroku Yamamoto's Combined Fleet, and a follow-up strategy was not formed until April 1942.<ref>Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|pp=13–15, 21–23; harvnb|Willmott|1983|pp=39–49; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=22–38.</ref> Admiral Yamamoto finally succeeded in winning the bureaucratic struggle with a thinly veiled threat to resign, after which his plan for the Central Pacific was adopted.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=33; Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|p=23</ref>

Yamamoto's primary strategic goal was the elimination of America's carrier forces, which he regarded as the principal threat to the overall Pacific War|Pacific campaign. This concern was acutely heightened by the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942, in which 16 United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell bombers launched from USS|Hornet|CV-8|6 bombed targets in Tokyo and several other Japanese cities. The raid, while militarily insignificant, was a shock to the Japanese and showed the existence of a gap in the defenses around the Japanese home islands as well as the accessibility of Japanese territory to American bombers.<ref>Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|pp=22–26</ref>

This, and other successful hit-and-run raids by American carriers in the South Pacific, showed that they were still a threat, although seemingly reluctant to be drawn into an all-out battle.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=31–32</ref> Yamamoto reasoned that another air attack on the main U.S. Naval base at Pearl Harbor would induce all of the American fleet to sail out to fight, including the carriers. However, considering the increased strength of American land-based air power on the Hawaiian Islands since the 7 December attack the previous year, he judged that it was now too risky to attack Pearl Harbor directly.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=33</ref>

Instead, Yamamoto selected Midway Atoll|Midway, a tiny atoll at the extreme northwest end of the Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Island chain, approximately convert|1300|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=off from Oahu. This meant that Midway was outside the effective range of almost all of the American aircraft stationed on the main Hawaiian islands. Midway was not especially important in the larger scheme of Japan's intentions, but the Japanese felt the Americans would consider Midway a vital outpost of Pearl Harbor and would therefore be compelled to defend it vigorously.<ref>harvnb|Willmott|1983|pp=66–67; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=33–34.</ref> The U.S. did consider Midway vital: after the battle, establishment of a U.S. submarine base on Midway allowed submarines operating from Pearl Harbor to refuel and re-provision, extending their radius of operations by convert|1200|mi. In addition to serving as a seaplane base, Midway's airstrips also served as a forward staging point for bomber attacks on Wake Island.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Midway_Atoll/preserving_the_past/After_the_Battle_of_Midway.html |title=After the Battle of Midway |publisher=Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115090812/http://www.fws.gov/midway/postwar.html |archivedate=15 January 2009 </ref>

=Yamamoto's plan: Operation MI=
File:Midway Atoll.jpg|thumb|Midway Atoll, several months before the battle. Eastern Island (with the airfield) is in the foreground, and the larger Sand Island is in the background to the west.

Typical of Japanese naval planning during World War II, Yamamoto's battle plan for taking Midway (named Operation MI) was exceedingly complex.<ref>Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|pp=375–379; harvnb|Willmott|1983|pp=110–117; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=52</ref> It required the careful and timely coordination of multiple battle groups over hundreds of miles of open sea. His design was also predicated on optimistic intelligence suggesting that USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6 and USS ''Hornet'', forming Task Force 16, were the only carriers available to the U.S. Pacific Fleet. During the Battle of the Coral Sea one month earlier, USS|Lexington|CV-2|6 had been sunk and USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6 suffered considerable damage such that the Japanese believed she too had been lost.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=63</ref> However, following hasty repairs at Pearl Harbor, ''Yorktown'' sortied and would go on to play a critical role in the discovery and eventual destruction of the Japanese fleet carriers at Midway. Finally, much of Yamamoto's planning, coinciding with the general feeling among the Japanese leadership at the time, was based on a gross misjudgment of American morale, which was believed to be debilitated from the string of Japanese victories in the preceding months.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=50</ref>

Yamamoto felt deception would be required to lure the U.S. fleet into a fatally compromised situation.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=53, derived from Japanese War History Series (''Senshi Sōshō''), Volume 43 ('Midowei Kaisen'), p. 118.</ref> To this end, he dispersed his forces so that their full extent (particularly his battleships) would be concealed from the Americans prior to battle. Critically, Yamamoto's supporting battleships and cruisers trailed Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo's carrier force by several hundred miles. They were intended to come up and destroy whatever elements of the U.S. fleet might come to Midway's defense once Nagumo's carriers had weakened them sufficiently for a daylight gun battle;<ref name="Tully, pp. 51, 55">Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=51, 55</ref> this tactic was typical of the battle doctrine of most major navies at the time.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=43–45, derived from ''Senshi Sōshō'', p. 196.</ref>

What Yamamoto did not know was that the U.S. had broken the main Japanese naval code (dubbed JN-25 by the Americans), divulging many details of his plan to the enemy. His emphasis on dispersal also meant none of his formations was in a position to support the others.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/guadoil1.htm|title=Oil and Japanese Strategy in the Solomons: A Postulate|website=www.combinedfleet.com</ref> For instance, despite the fact that Nagumo's carriers were expected to carry out strikes against Midway and bear the brunt of American counterattacks, the only warships in his fleet larger than the screening force of twelve destroyers were two Kongō-class battlecruiser|''Kongō''-class fast battleships, two heavy cruisers, and one light cruiser. By contrast, Yamamoto and Kondo had between them two light carriers, five battleships, four heavy cruisers, and two light cruisers, none of which would see action at Midway.<ref name="Tully, pp. 51, 55" /> The light carriers of the trailing forces and Yamamoto's three battleships were unable to keep pace with the carriers of the ''Kidō Butai''refn|The ''Kidō Butai'' (機動部隊, "Mobile Unit/Force") was the Combined Fleet's tactical designation for its carrier battle group. This title was used as a term of convenience and was not a formal name for the organization. One month after Midway, the ''Kidō Butai'' was disbanded and its surviving ships were transferred to Third Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Third Fleet.|group=nb and so could not have sailed in company with them. The distance between Yamamoto and Kondo's forces and Nagumo's carriers had grave implications during the battle: the invaluable reconnaissance capability of the scout planes carried by the cruisers and carriers, as well as the additional antiaircraft capability of the cruisers and the other two battleships of the ''Kongō''-class in the trailing forces, was denied to Nagumo.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=55–56</ref>

=Aleutian invasion=
Main article|Aleutian Islands Campaign

In order to obtain support from the Imperial Japanese Army for the Midway operation, the Imperial Japanese Navy agreed to support their invasion of the Aleutian Islands. The IJA wished to occupy the western Aleutians to place the Japanese home islands out of range of U.S. land-based bombers based in Alaska. The Japanese operations in the Aleutian Islands (Operation AL) removed yet more ships that could otherwise have augmented the force striking Midway. Whereas many earlier historical accounts considered the Aleutians operation as a feint to draw American forces away, early twenty-first century research has suggested that AL was intended to be launched simultaneously with the attack on Midway. A one-day delay in the sailing of Nagumo's task force resulted in Operation AL beginning a day before the Midway attack.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=43–45, derived from ''Senshi Sōshō'', pp. 119–121.</ref>

To do battle with an enemy expected to muster four or five carriers, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, needed every available U.S. flight deck. He already had Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral William Halsey's two-carrier (''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet'') task force at hand, though Halsey was stricken with severe dermatitis and had to be replaced by Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, Halsey's escort commander.<ref>Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|pp=80–81; harvnb|Cressman|1990|p=37</ref> Nimitz also hurriedly recalled Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher's task force, including the carrier ''Yorktown'', from the South West Pacific Area.<ref>Harvnb|Lord|1967|pp=23–26</ref>

Despite estimates that ''Yorktown'', damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require several months of repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so.<ref>harvnb|Willmott|1983|p=337</ref> The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state,<ref>harvnb|Cressman|1990|pp=37–45; harvnb|Lord|1967|pp=37–39</ref> judged good enough for two or three weeks of operations, as Nimitz required.<ref>harvnb|Willmott|1983|p=338</ref><ref>cite web

''Yorktown'''s partially depleted air group was rebuilt using whatever planes and pilots could be found. Scouting Five (VS-5) was replaced with Bombing Three (VB-3) from USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6. Torpedo Five (VT-5) was also replaced by Torpedo Three (VT-3). Fighting Three (VF-3) was reconstituted to replace VF-42 with sixteen pilots from VF-42 and eleven pilots from VF-3 with Lieutenant Commander John Thach|John S. "Jimmy" Thach in command. Some of the aircrew were inexperienced, which may have contributed to an accident in which Thach's executive officer Lt Cmndr Donald Lovelace was killed.<ref>harvnb|Willmott|1983|pp=340–341</ref> Despite efforts to get ''Saratoga'' (which had been undergoing repairs on the American West Coast) ready for the coming engagement, the need to resupply and assemble sufficient escorts meant she was not able to reach Midway until after the battle.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=93–94</ref>

On Midway, by 4 June the USN had stationed four squadrons of Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBYs—31 aircraft in total—for long-range reconnaissance duties, and 6 brand-new Grumman TBF Avengers, the latter a detachment from ''Hornet'''s VT-8.<ref>harvnb|Scrivner|1987|p=8</ref> The Marine Corps stationed 19 Douglas SBD Dauntless, 7 Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4F-3 Wildcats, 17 Vought SB2U Vindicators, and 21 Brewster F2A Buffalos. The USAAF contributed a squadron of 17 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortresses and 4 Martin B-26 Marauders equipped with torpedoes: in total 126 aircraft. Although the F2As and SB2Us were already obsolete, they were the only aircraft available to the Marine Corps at the time.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=96</ref>

=Japanese shortcomings=
File:AkagiDeckApril42.jpg|thumb|250px|Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2, the flagship of the Japanese carrier striking force which Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor, as well as Darwin, Australia|Darwin, Rabaul, and Colombo, Sri Lanka|Colombo, in April 1942 prior to the battle

During the Battle of the Coral Sea one month earlier, the Japanese light carrier ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shōhō||2 had been sunk, while the fleet carrier Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shōkaku||2 had been severely damaged by three bomb hits and was in drydock for months of repair. Although the fleet carrier Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2 escaped the battle undamaged, she had lost almost half her air group, and was in port in Kure, Hiroshima|Kure awaiting replacement planes and pilots. That there were none immediately available is attributable to the failure of the IJN crew training program, which already showed signs of being unable to replace losses. Instructors from the Yokosuka Air Corps were employed in an effort to make up the shortfall.<ref name=Willmott101>harvnb|Willmott|1983|p=101</ref>

Historians Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully believe that by combining the surviving aircraft and pilots from ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku'', it is likely that ''Zuikaku'' could have been equipped with almost a full composite air group. They also note that doing so would have violated Japanese carrier doctrine, which stressed that carriers and their airgroups must train as a single unit (in contrast, American air squadrons were considered interchangeable between carriers). In any case, the Japanese apparently made no serious attempt to get ''Zuikaku'' ready for the forthcoming battle.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=65–67</ref>

Thus, Fifth Carrier Division|Carrier Division 5, consisting of the two most advanced aircraft carriers of the ''Kido Butai'', would not be available, which meant that Vice-Admiral Nagumo had only two thirds of the fleet carriers at his disposal: Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2 and Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2 forming First Carrier Division|Carrier Division 1 and Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiryū||2 and Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sōryū||2 as Second Carrier Division|Carrier Division 2. This was partly due to fatigue; Japanese carriers had been constantly on operations since 7 December 1941, including raids on Bombing of Darwin (February 1942)|Darwin and Indian Ocean raid|Colombo.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=63–64, 91</ref> Nonetheless, the First Carrier Strike Force sailed with 248 available aircraft on the four carriers (60 on ''Akagi'', 74 on ''Kaga'' (B5N2 squadron oversized), 57 on ''Hiryū'' and 57 on ''Sōryū'').<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=450–451</ref> 

The main Japanese carrier-borne strike aircraft were the Aichi D3A|D3A1 "Val" dive bomber and the Nakajima B5N|B5N2 "Kate", which was used either as a torpedo bomber or as a level bomber. The main carrier fighter was the fast and highly maneuverable Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M "Zero". For a variety of reasons, production of the "Val" had been drastically reduced, while that of the "Kate" had been stopped completely and, as a consequence, there were none available to replace losses.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=89</ref> In addition, many of the aircraft being used during the June 1942 operations had been operational since late November 1941 and, although they were well-maintained, many were almost worn out and had become increasingly unreliable. These factors meant all carriers of the ''Kido Butai'' had fewer aircraft than their normal complement, with few spare aircraft or parts stored in the carriers' hangars.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=89–91</ref>refn|The code names "Val", "Kate" and "Zeke", which are often applied to these aircraft, were not introduced until late 1943 by the Allied forces. The D3A was normally referred to by the Japanese as ''Type 99 Navy dive bomber'', the B5N as the ''Type 97 Navy torpedo bomber'' and the A6M as the ''Type 0 Navy fighter''; the latter was colloquially known as the "Zero".<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=78–80</ref>|group=nb

In addition, Nagumo's carrier force suffered from several defensive deficiencies which gave it, in Mark Peattie's words, a " 'wikt:glass jaw|glass jaw': it could throw a punch but couldn't take one."<ref>Peattie, p. 159</ref> Japanese carrier anti-aircraft guns and associated fire control systems had several design and configuration deficiencies which limited their effectiveness. The IJN's fleet combat air patrol (CAP) consisted of too few fighter aircraft and was hampered by an inadequate early warning system, including a lack of radar. Poor radio communications with the fighter aircraft inhibited effective command and control of the CAP. The carriers' escorting warships were deployed as visual scouts in a ring at long range, not as close anti-aircraft escorts, as they lacked training, doctrine, and sufficient anti-aircraft guns.<ref>Parshall and Tully, pp. 85 and 136–145; Peattie, pp. 155–59: Stille, pp. 14–15, 50–51</ref>

Japanese strategic scouting arrangements prior to the battle were also in disarray. A picket line of Japanese submarines was late getting into position (partly because of Yamamoto's haste), which let the American carriers reach their assembly point northeast of Midway (known as "Point Luck") without being detected.<ref>harvnb|Willmott|1983|p=351; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=98–99</ref> A second attempt at reconnaissance, using four-engine Kawanishi H8K|H8K "Emily" flying boats to scout Pearl Harbor prior to the battle and detect whether the American carriers were present, part of Operation K, was thwarted when Japanese submarines assigned to refuel the search aircraft discovered that the intended refueling point—a hitherto deserted bay off French Frigate Shoals—was now occupied by American warships, because the Japanese had carried out an identical mission in March. Thus, Japan was deprived of any knowledge concerning the movements of the American carriers immediately before the battle.<ref>harvnb|Lord|1967|pp=37–39; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=99</ref>

Japanese radio intercepts did notice an increase in both American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans were not changed; Yamamoto, at sea in Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2, assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo, and did not communicate with him by radio, so as not to reveal his position.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=102–104; harvnb|Willmott|1983|pp=349–351</ref> These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=101–102</ref>

=US code-breaking=
Admiral Nimitz had one critical advantage: US cryptanalysts had partially broken the Japanese Navy's JN-25b code.<ref name="MS-134">Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=134</ref> Since early 1942, the US had been decoding messages stating that there would soon be an operation at objective "AF". It was initially not known where "AF" was, but Commander Joseph Rochefort and his team at Station HYPO were able to confirm that it was Midway: Captain Wilfred Holmes devised a ruse of telling the base at Midway (by secure undersea cable) to broadcast an Plaintext|uncoded radio message stating that Midway's water purification system had broken down.<ref>cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/90midway/90facts1.htm | title=U.S. National Park Service: The Battle of Midway: Turning the Tide in the Pacific 1.

HYPO was also able to determine the date of the attack as either 4 or 5 June, and to provide Nimitz with a complete IJN order of battle.<ref name="MS-138-141">Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=138–141</ref>

Japan had a new codebook, but its introduction had been delayed, enabling HYPO to read messages for several crucial days; the new code, which would take several days to be cracked, came into use on 24 May, but the important breaks had already been made.<ref name="Willmott 1983 304">harvnb|Willmott|1983|p=304</ref>

As a result, the Americans entered the battle with a very good picture of where, when, and in what strength the Japanese would appear. Nimitz knew that the Japanese had negated their numerical advantage by dividing their ships into four separate task groups, all too widely separated to be able to support each other.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=409</ref> This dispersal resulted in few fast ships being available to escort the Carrier Striking Force, reducing the number of Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns protecting the carriers. Nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three carriers, plus those on Midway Island, gave the U.S. rough parity with Yamamoto's four carriers, mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained mainly unaware of their opponent's true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.<ref name="Willmott 1983 304"/>

At about 09:00 on 3 June, Ensign Jack Reid, piloting a Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY from U.S. Navy patrol squadron VPB-44|VP-44,<ref name=VP44Mid>cite web | url=http://vp44goldenpelicans.com/VP-44%20Ford%20Island%20&%20Midway.htm | title=VP-44 at Ford Island and the Battle of Midway | last=Watson | first=Richard | work= |publisher= | accessdate=5 October 2013</ref> spotted the Japanese Occupation Force convert|500|nmi|mi km|abbr=off to the west-southwest of Midway. He mistakenly reported this group as the Main Force.<ref>harvnb|Lundstrom|2006|p=238</ref>

Nine B-17s took off from Midway at 12:30 for the first air attack. Three hours later, they found Tanaka's transport group convert|570|nmi|mi km|abbr=off to the west.<ref name=nimitz>Admiral Nimitz's [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/Midway/Midway-CinCPac.html CinCPac report] of the battle. From Hyperwar. Retrieved 13 February 2008.</ref>

Under heavy anti-aircraft fire, they dropped their bombs. Although their crews reported hitting 4 ships,<ref name=nimitz/> none of the bombs actually hit anything and no significant damage was inflicted.<ref name=toyama>cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS/IJO/IJO-60.html |title=Interrogation of: Captain Toyama, Yasumi, IJN; Chief of Staff Second Destroyer Squadron, flagship Jintsu (CL), at Midway |publisher=USSBS From Hyperwar |accessdate=14 February 2008</ref> Early the following morning, the Japanese oil tanker ''Kawasaki-type oiler#Akatsuki Maru class|Akebono Maru'' sustained the first hit when Mark 13 torpedo|a torpedo from an attacking PBY struck her around 01:00. This was the only successful air-launched torpedo attack by the U.S. during the entire battle.<ref name=toyama/>

At 04:30 on 4 June, Nagumo launched his initial attack on Midway itself, consisting of 36 Aichi D3A dive bombers and 36 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers, escorted by 36 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters. At the same time, he launched his 8 search aircraft (one from the heavy cruiser Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tone|1937|2 launched 30 minutes late). Japanese reconnaissance arrangements were flimsy, with too few aircraft to adequately cover the assigned search areas, laboring under poor weather conditions to the northeast and east of the task force. As Nagumo's bombers and fighters were taking off, 11 PBYs were leaving Midway to run their search patterns. At 05:34, a PBY reported sighting 2 Japanese carriers and another spotted the inbound airstrike 10 minutes later.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=107–112, 126–128, 132–134</ref>

Midway's radar picked up the enemy at a distance of several miles, and interceptors were scrambled. Unescorted bombers headed off to attack the Japanese carriers, their fighter escorts remaining behind to defend Midway. At 06:20, Japanese carrier aircraft bombed and heavily damaged the U.S. base. Midway-based Marine fighters led by Major Floyd B. Parks, which included 6 Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4Fs and 20 F2As,<ref>Harvnb|Stephen|1988|pp=166–167</ref> intercepted the Japanese and suffered heavy losses, though they managed to destroy 4 B5Ns, as well as a single A6M. Within the first few minutes, 2 Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4Fs and 13 F2As were destroyed, while most of the surviving U.S. planes were damaged, with only 2 remaining airworthy. American anti-aircraft fire was intense and accurate, destroying 3 additional Japanese aircraft and damaging many more.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=200–204</ref>

Of the 108 Japanese aircraft involved in this attack, 11 were destroyed (including 3 that ditched), 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged to some degree. The initial Japanese attack did not succeed in neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force, and most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway's defenses would be necessary if troops were to go ashore by 7 June.<ref>harvnb|Lord|1967|p=110; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=149</ref>

Having taken off prior to the Japanese attack, American bombers based on Midway made several attacks on the Japanese carrier force. These included 6 Grumman Avengers, detached to Midway from ''Hornet'''s VT-8 (Midway was the combat debut of both VT-8 and the TBF); Marine Scout-Bombing Squadron 241 (VMSB-241), consisting of 11 SB2U-3s and 16 SBDs, plus 4 USAAF B-26s of the 408th Bombardment Squadron|18th Reconnaissance and 69th Bomb Squadrons armed with torpedoes, and 15 B-17s of the 31st Test and Evaluation Squadron|31st, 72d Test and Evaluation Squadron|72nd, and 50th Education Squadron|431st Bomb Squadrons. The Japanese repelled these attacks, losing 3 fighters while destroying 5 TBFs, 2 SB2Us, 8 SBDs, and 2 B-26s.<ref name="Prange, p. 207">Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|pp=207–212; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=149–152; cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/USN-CN-Midway/USN-CN-Midway-6.html |title=Office of Naval Intelligence Combat Narrative: "Midway's Attack on the Enemy Carriers" |accessdate=28 January 2012</ref> Among the dead was Major Lofton R.

The main Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|airfield at Guadalcanal was named after him in August 1942.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=176</ref>

One B-26, after being seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire, made a suicide run on ''Akagi''. Making no attempt to pull out of its run, the aircraft narrowly missed crashing directly into the carrier's bridge (nautical)|bridge, which could have killed Nagumo and his command staff.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=152</ref> This experience may well have contributed to Nagumo's determination to launch another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.<ref name="Prange, p. 207"/>

=Nagumo's dilemma=
File:Hiryu f075712.jpg|thumb|A B-17 attack misses ''Hiryū''; this was taken between 08:00–08:30. A ''Shotai'' of 3 Zeros is lined up near the bridge. This was one of several combat air patrols launched during the day.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=182</ref>

In accordance with Japanese carrier military doctrine|doctrine at the time, Admiral Nagumo had kept half of his aircraft in reserve. These comprised two squadrons each of dive bombers and torpedo bombers. The dive bombers were as yet unarmed. The torpedo bombers were armed with torpedoes should any American warships be located.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=130–132</ref>

At 07:15, Nagumo ordered his reserve planes to be re-armed with contact-fused general purpose bombs for use against land targets.
This was a result of the attacks from Midway, as well as of the morning flight leader's recommendation of a second strike. Re-arming had been underway for about 30 minutes when, at 07:40,<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=156–159</ref> the delayed scout plane from ''Tone'' signaled that it had sighted a sizable American naval force to the east, but neglected to describe its composition. Later evidence suggests Nagumo did not receive the sighting report until 08:00.<ref>Harvnb|Isom|2007|pp=129–139</ref>

Nagumo quickly reversed his order to re-arm the bombers with general purpose bombs and demanded that the scout plane ascertain the composition of the American force. Another 20–40 minutes elapsed before ''Tones scout finally radioed the presence of a single carrier in the American force. This was one of the carriers from Task Force 16. The other carrier was not sighted.<ref>Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|pp=216–217; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=159–161, 183</ref>

Nagumo was now in a quandary. Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, leading Carrier Division 2 (''Hiryū'' and ''Sōryū''), recommended that Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand: 18 Aichi D3A1 dive bombers each on ''Sōryū'' and ''Hiryū'', and half the ready cover patrol aircraft.<ref>Harvnb|Bicheno|2001|p=134</ref> Nagumo's opportunity to hit the American ships<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=165–170</ref> was now limited by the imminent return of his Midway strike force. The returning strike force needed to land promptly or it would have to ditch into the sea. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese never had an opportunity to position ("spot") their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=168–173</ref>

The few aircraft on the Japanese flight decks at the time of the attack were either defensive fighters or, in the case of ''Sōryū'', fighters being spotted to augment the combat air patrol.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=231, derived from ''Senshi Sōshō'', pp. 372–378.</ref> Spotting his flight decks and launching aircraft would have required at least 30 minutes.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=121–124</ref> Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, Nagumo would be committing some of his reserve to battle without proper anti-ship armament, and likely without fighter escort; indeed, he had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers had been shot down.<ref>Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|p=233</ref>

Japanese carrier doctrine preferred the launching of fully constituted strikes rather than piecemeal attacks. Without confirmation of whether the American force included carriers (not received until 08:20), Nagumo's reaction was doctrinaire.<ref>Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|pp=217–218, 372–373; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=170–173.</ref> In addition, the arrival of another land-based American air strike at 07:53 gave weight to the need to attack the island again. In the end, Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed with torpedoes.<ref>Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|pp=231–237; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=170–173; harvnb|Willmott|1983|pp=395–398</ref>

In the final analysis, it made no difference; Fletcher's carriers had launched their planes beginning at 07:00 (with ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet'' having completed launching by 07:55, but ''Yorktown'' not until 09:08), so the aircraft that would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. Even if Nagumo had not strictly followed carrier doctrine, he could not have prevented the launch of the American attack.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=174–175; harvnb|Willmott|1983|pp=395–398</ref>

=Attacks on the Japanese fleet=
File:Vt8-g-gay-may42.jpg|thumb|250px|Ensign (rank)|Ensign George H. Gay, Jr.|George Gay (right), sole survivor of VT-8's Douglas TBD Devastator|TBD Devastator squadron, in front of his aircraft, 4 June 1942
The Americans had already launched their carrier aircraft against the Japanese. Fletcher, in overall command aboard ''Yorktown'', and benefiting from PBY sighting reports from the early morning, ordered Spruance to launch against the Japanese as soon as was practical, while initially holding ''Yorktown'' in reserve in case any other Japanese carriers were found.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.cv6.org/1942/midway/default.htm |title=1942 – Battle of Midway |publisher=Joel Shepherd|accessdate=23 July 2015</ref>

Spruance judged that, though the range was extreme, a strike could succeed and gave the order to launch the attack. He then left Halsey's Chief of Staff, Captain Miles Browning, to work out the details and oversee the launch. The carriers had to launch into the wind, so the light southeasterly breeze would require them to steam away from the Japanese at high speed. Browning therefore suggested a launch time of 07:00, giving the carriers an hour to close on the Japanese at convert|25|kn. This would place them at about convert|155|nmi from the Japanese fleet, assuming it did not change course. The first plane took off from Spruance's carriers ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet'' a few minutes after 07:00.<ref>Harvnb|Lundstrom|1984|pp=332–333</ref>  Fletcher, upon completing his own scouting flights,<!--why was Fletcher scouting the wrong direction?--> followed suit at 08:00 from ''Yorktown''.<ref name="Cressman p. 84">harvnb|Cressman|1990|pp=84–89; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=215–216, 226–227; Harvnb|Buell|1987|p=494</ref>

Fletcher, along with ''Yorktowns commanding officer, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and their staffs, had acquired first-hand experience in organizing and launching a full strike against an enemy force in the Coral Sea, but there was no time to pass these lessons on to ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet'' which were tasked with launching the first strike.<ref name="cv6.org">cite web |url=http://www.cv6.org/1942/midway/midway_2.htm |title=Battle of Midway |publisher=Joel Shepherd |accessdate=23 July 2015</ref> Spruance ordered the striking aircraft to proceed to target immediately, rather than waste time waiting for the strike force to assemble, since neutralizing enemy carriers was the key to the survival of his own task force.<ref name="Cressman p. 84" /><ref name="cv6.org" />

While the Japanese were able to launch 108 aircraft in just seven minutes, it took ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet'' over an hour to launch 117.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=174</ref> Spruance judged that the need to throw something at the enemy as soon as possible was greater than the need to coordinate the attack by aircraft of different types and speeds (fighters, bombers, and torpedo bombers). Accordingly, American squadrons were launched piecemeal and proceeded to the target in several different groups. It was accepted that the lack of coordination would diminish the impact of the American attacks and increase their casualties, but Spruance calculated that this was worthwhile, since keeping the Japanese under aerial attack impaired their ability to launch a counterstrike (Japanese tactics preferred fully constituted attacks), and he gambled that he would find Nagumo with his flight decks at their most vulnerable.<ref name="Cressman p. 84" /><ref name="cv6.org" />

American carrier aircraft had difficulty locating the target, despite the positions they had been given. The strike from ''Hornet'', led by Commander Stanhope C. Ring, followed an incorrect heading of 265 degrees rather than the 240 degrees indicated by the contact report. As a result, Air Group Eight's dive bombers missed the Japanese carriers.<ref>Harvnb|Mrazek|2008|p=113</ref><ref>Harvnb|Lundstrom|1984|p=341</ref>  Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8, from ''Hornet''), led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron, broke formation from Ring and followed the correct heading. The 10 Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4Fs from ''Hornet'' ran out of fuel and had to Water landing|ditch.<ref name="Ewing 2004 p 71 85 86 307">harvnb|Ewing|2004|pp=71, 85, 86, 307</ref>

Ensign George H. Gay, Jr. was the only survivor of the 30 aircrew of VT-8. VT-6 lost 9 of its 14 Devastators (one ditched later), and 10 of 12 Devastators from ''Yorktown'''s VA-35 (U.S. Navy)|VT-3 (who attacked at 10:10) were shot down with no hits to show for their effort, thanks in part to the abysmal performance of their unimproved Mark 13 torpedoes.<ref>Harvnb|Blair|1975|p=238</ref> Midway was the last time the TBD Devastator was used in combat.<ref name="Military Factory">cite web |title=Douglas TBD Devastator Torpedo Bomber (1937) |url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail-page-2.asp?aircraft_id=732 |website=Military Factory |accessdate=27 August 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6b69Nf43c?url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail-page-2.asp?aircraft_id=732 |archivedate=27 August 2015 |deadurl=yes  </ref>

The Japanese combat air patrol, flying Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeros,<ref>Harvnb|Thruelsen|1976|pp=186, 189, 190</ref> made short work of the unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs managed to get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before dropping their torpedoes—close enough to be able to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to make sharp evasive maneuvers—but all of their torpedoes either missed or failed to explode.<ref name="ReferenceB">cite web|url=http://www.cv6.org/1942/midway/midway_3.htm|title=Battle of Midway (pg 3)</ref> Remarkably, senior Navy and Bureau of Ordnance officers never questioned why half a dozen torpedoes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no results.<ref>Harvnb|Crenshaw|1995|p=158</ref> The performance of American torpedoes in the early months of the war was scandalous, as shot after shot missed by running directly under the target (deeper than intended), prematurely exploded, or hit targets (sometimes with an audible clang) and failed to explode at all.<ref name="Morison IV">Harvnb|Morison|1949|pp=230–232</ref><ref>cite journal |last=Patrick |first=John |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_47/torpedo.html |accessdate=23 July 2015 |title=The Hard Lessons Of World War II Torpedo Failures |journal=Undersea Warfare |issue=47 |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723172623/http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_47/torpedo.html |archivedate=23 July 2015  </ref>

Despite their failure to score any hits, the American torpedo attacks achieved three important results. First, they kept the Japanese carriers off balance and unable to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, the poor control of the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) meant they were out of position for subsequent attacks. Third, many of the Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=215–216, 226–227</ref> The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 from ''Yorktown'' at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP to the southeast quadrant of the fleet.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=226–227</ref> Better discipline, and the employment of a greater number of Zeroes for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to prevent (or at least mitigate) the damage caused by the coming American attacks.<ref>Harvnb|Bicheno|2001|p=62</ref>

By chance, at the same time VT-3 was sighted by the Japanese, three squadrons of SBDs from ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'' were approaching from the southwest and northeast. The ''Yorktown'' squadron (VB-3) had flown just behind VT-3, but elected to attack from a different course. The two squadrons from ''Enterprise'' (VB-6 and VS-6) were running low on fuel because of the time spent looking for the enemy. Air Group Commander C. Wade McClusky, Jr. decided to continue the search, and by good fortune spotted the wake of the Japanese destroyer ship|Japanese destroyer|Arashi||2, steaming at full speed to rejoin Nagumo's carriers after having unsuccessfully depth-charged U.S. submarine USS|Nautilus|SS-168|2, which had unsuccessfully attacked the battleship Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2.<ref name="kirishimamove">cite web|year = 2006 | url = http://www.combinedfleet.com/Kirishima.html | title = IJN Kirishima: Tabular Record of Movement | work = Senkan! | publisher = combinedfleet.com | accessdate = 6 June 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070610144811/http://www.combinedfleet.com/Kirishima.html| archivedate= 10 June 2007 | deadurl= no</ref> Some bombers were lost from fuel exhaustion before the attack commenced.<ref>Harvnb|Tillman|1976|pp=69–73</ref>

Wade McClusky |publisher=cv6.org |accessdate=26 January 2012</ref> All three American dive-bomber squadrons (VB-6, VS-6 and VB-3) arrived almost simultaneously at the perfect time, locations and altitudes to attack.<ref>Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|pp=259–261, 267–269; harvnb|Cressman|1990|pp=96–97; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=215–216, 226–227</ref> Most of the Japanese CAP was directing its attention to the torpedo planes of VT-3 and was out of position; meanwhile, armed Japanese strike aircraft filled the hangar decks, fuel hoses snaked across the decks as refueling operations were hastily being completed, and the repeated change of ordnance meant that bombs and torpedoes were stacked around the hangars, rather than stowed safely in the Magazine (artillery)|magazines, making the Japanese carriers extraordinarily vulnerable.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=250</ref>

Beginning at 10:22, the two squadrons of ''Enterprise'''s air group split up with the intention of sending one squadron each to attack ''Kaga'' and ''Akagi''. A miscommunication caused both of the squadrons to dive at the ''Kaga''. Recognizing the error, Lieutenant Richard Halsey Best and his two wingmen were able to pull out of their dives and, after judging that ''Kaga'' was doomed, headed north to attack ''Akagi''. Coming under an onslaught of bombs from almost two full squadrons, ''Kaga'' sustained four or five direct hits, which caused heavy damage and started multiple fires. One of the bombs landed near the bridge, killing Captain Jisaku Okada and most of the ship's senior officers.<ref name="ReferenceB" /> Lieutenant Clarence E. Dickinson, part of McClusky's group, recalled:
quote|We were coming down in all directions on the port side of the carrier&nbsp;... I recognized her as the ''Kaga''; and she was enormous&nbsp;... The target was utterly satisfying&nbsp;... I saw a bomb hit just behind where I was aiming&nbsp;... I saw the deck rippling and curling back in all directions exposing a great section of the hangar below&nbsp;... I saw [my] 500-pound bomb hit right abreast of the [carrier's] island. The two 100-pound bombs struck in the forward area of the parked planes&nbsp;... sfn|Miller|2001|p=123
 

Several minutes later, Best and his two wingmen dove on the ''Akagi''. Mitsuo Fuchida, the Japanese aviator who had led the attack on Pearl Harbor, was on the ''Akagi'' when it was hit, and described the attack:
quote|A look-out screamed: "Hell-Divers!" I looked up to see three black enemy planes plummeting towards our ship. Some of our machineguns managed to fire a few frantic bursts at them, but it was too late. The plump silhouettes of the American Dauntless dive-bombers quickly grew larger, and then a number of black objects suddenly floated eerily from their wings.sfn|Beevor|2012|page=310 

Although ''Akagi'' sustained only one direct hit (almost certainly dropped by Lieutenant Best), it proved to be a fatal blow: the bomb struck the edge of the mid-ship deck elevator and penetrated to the upper hangar deck, where it exploded among the armed and fueled aircraft in the vicinity. Nagumo's chief of staff, Ryūnosuke Kusaka, recorded "a terrific fire&nbsp;... bodies all over the place&nbsp;... Planes stood tail up, belching livid flames and jet-black smoke, making it impossible to bring the fires under control."sfn|Keegan|2004|p=216 Another bomb exploded under water very close astern; the resulting geyser bent the flight deck upward "in grotesque configurations" and caused crucial rudder damage.<ref name="ReferenceB" />sfn|Keegan|2004|p=216refn|Other sources claim a stern hit, but Parshall and Tully make a case for a near miss, because of rudder damage from a high explosive bomb.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=253–259</ref>|group=nb

Simultaneously, ''Yorktown'''s VB-3, commanded by Max Leslie, went for ''Sōryū'', scoring at least three hits and causing extensive damage. Some of Leslie's bombers did not have bombs as they were accidentally released when the pilots attempted to use electrical arming switches. Nevertheless, Leslie and others still dove, strafing carrier decks and providing cover for those who had bombs.<ref>cite book|author=Barrett Tillman|title=SBD Dauntless Units of World War 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8KnCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA39|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78200-719-7|page=39</ref> Gasoline ignited, creating an "inferno", while stacked bombs and ammunition detonated.sfn|Beevor|2012|p=310 VT-3 targeted ''Hiryū'', which was hemmed in by ''Sōryū'', ''Kaga'', and ''Akagi'', but achieved no hits.<ref name="Parshall 2005 330–353">Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=330–353</ref>

Within six minutes, ''Sōryū'' and ''Kaga'' were ablaze from stem to stern, as fires spread through the ships. ''Akagi'', having been struck by only one bomb, took longer to burn, but the resulting fires quickly expanded and soon proved impossible to extinguish; she too was eventually consumed by flames and had to be abandoned. All three carriers remained temporarily afloat, as none had suffered damage below the waterline, other than the rudder damage to ''Akagi'' caused by the near miss close astern. Despite initial hopes that ''Akagi'' could be saved or at least towed back to Japan, all three carriers were eventually abandoned and scuttling|scuttled.<ref name="Parshall 2005 330–353"/>refn|Parshall and Tully argue that even if ''Kaga'' had been towed back to Japan, the permanent structural damage caused by the inferno onboard would likely have made the carrier unusable for anything except Ship breaking|scrapping.sfn|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=337 |group=nb

''Hiryū'', the sole surviving Japanese aircraft carrier, wasted little time in counterattacking. ''Hiryū'''s first attack wave, consisting of 18 Aichi D3A|D3As and 6 fighter escorts, followed the retreating American aircraft and attacked the first carrier they encountered, ''Yorktown'', hitting her with three bombs, which blew a hole in the deck, snuffed out all but one of her boilers<ref>Harrington, Pat; and Harrington, Joseph D. Rendezvous at Midway (New York: The John Day Company), 1967.</ref>, and destroyed one anti-aircraft mount. The damage also forced Admiral Fletcher to move his command staff to the heavy cruiser USS|Astoria|CA-34|2. Damage control parties were able to temporarily patch the flight deck and restore power to several boilers within an hour, giving her a speed of convert|19|kn and enabling her to resume air operations. Thirteen Japanese dive bombers and three escorting fighters were lost in this attack (two escorting fighters turned back early after they were damaged attacking some of ''Enterprise'''s SBDs returning from their attack on the Japanese carriers).<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=262, 292–299, 312</ref>

Approximately one hour later, ''Hiryū's'' second attack wave, consisting of ten B5Ns and six escorting A6Ms, arrived over ''Yorktown''; the repair efforts had been so effective that the Japanese pilots assumed that ''Yorktown'' must be a different, undamaged carrier.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=312</ref> They attacked, crippling ''Yorktown'' with two torpedoes; she lost all power and developed a 23-degree list to port. Five torpedo bombers and two fighters were shot down in this attack.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=311, 316, 318</ref>

News of the two strikes, with the mistaken reports that each had sunk an American carrier, greatly improved Japanese morale. The few surviving aircraft were all recovered aboard ''Hiryū''. Despite the heavy losses, the Japanese believed that they could scrape together enough aircraft for one more strike against what they believed to be the only remaining American carrier.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=323</ref>

=American counterattack=
Late in the afternoon, a ''Yorktown'' scout aircraft located ''Hiryū'', prompting ''Enterprise'' to launch a final strike of 24 dive bombers (including 6 SBDs from VS-6, 4 SBDs from VB-6, and 14 SBDs from ''Yorktowns VB-3). Despite ''Hiryū'' being defended by a strong cover of more than a dozen Zero fighters, the attack by ''Enterprise'' and orphaned ''Yorktown'' aircraft launched from ''Enterprise'' was successful: four bombs (possibly five) hit ''Hiryū'', leaving her ablaze and unable to operate aircraft. ''Hornet'''s strike, launched late because of a communications error, concentrated on the remaining escort ships, but failed to score any hits.<ref name="Parshall 2005 328–329, 354–359">Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=328–329, 354–359</ref>

After futile attempts at controlling the blaze, most of the crew remaining on ''Hiryū'' were evacuated and the remainder of the fleet continued sailing northeast in an attempt to intercept the American carriers. Despite a scuttling attempt by a Japanese destroyer that hit her with a torpedo and then departed quickly, ''Hiryū'' stayed afloat for several more hours, being discovered early the next morning by an aircraft from the escort carrier ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hōshō||2 and prompting hopes she could be saved, or at least towed back to Japan. Soon after being spotted, ''Hiryū'' sank. Rear-Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, together with the ship's captain, Tomeo Kaku, chose to go down with the ship, costing Japan perhaps its best carrier officer.<ref name="Parshall 2005 328–329, 354–359"/>

As darkness fell, both sides took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged to abandon the derelict ''Yorktown'' and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, but he was still unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo during the day and persisted as night fell.<ref name="Potter & Nimitz 1960 p.682">harvnb|Potter|Nimitz|1960|p=682</ref>

Finally, fearing a possible night encounter with Japanese surface forces,<ref name="Potter & Nimitz 1960 p.682"/> and believing Yamamoto still intended to invade, based in part on a misleading contact report from the submarine USS|Tambor|SS-198|2,<ref name="Blair 1975 246–247">Harvnb|Blair|1975|pp=246–247</ref> Spruance changed course and withdrew to the east, turning back west towards the enemy at midnight.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=344</ref> For his part, Yamamoto initially decided to continue the engagement and sent his remaining surface forces searching eastward for the American carriers. Simultaneously, he detached a cruiser raiding force to bombard the island. The Japanese surface forces failed to make contact with the Americans because Spruance had decided to briefly withdraw eastward, and Yamamoto ordered a general withdrawal to the west.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=382–383</ref> It was fortunate for the U.S. that Spruance did not pursue, for had he come in contact with Yamamoto's heavy ships, including ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2, in the dark and considering the Japanese Navy's superiority in night-attack tactics at the time, there is a very high probability his cruisers would have been overwhelmed and his carriers sunk.<ref>Harvnb|Blair|1975|pp=246–247; harvnb|Willmott|1983|pp=381–382</ref>

Spruance failed to regain contact with Yamamoto's forces on 5 June, despite extensive searches. Towards the end of the day he launched a search-and-destroy mission to seek out any remnants of Nagumo's carrier force. This late afternoon strike narrowly missed detecting Yamamoto's main body and failed to score hits on a straggling Japanese destroyer. The strike planes returned to the carriers after nightfall, prompting Spruance to order ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet'' to turn on their lights to aid the landings.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=364–365</ref>

At 02:15 on the night of 5/6 June, Commander John Murphy's USS|Tambor|SS-198|2, lying convert|90|nmi west of Midway, made the second of the submarine force's two major contributions to the battle's outcome, although its impact was heavily blunted by Murphy himself.<ref name="Blair, 250">Harvnb|Blair|1975|p=250</ref> Sighting several ships, neither Murphy nor his executive officer, Edward Spruance (son of Admiral Spruance), could identify them. Uncertain of whether they were friendly or not and unwilling to approach any closer to verify their heading or type, Murphy decided to send a vague report of "four large ships" to Admiral Robert Henry English|Robert English, Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet (ComSubPac|COMSUBPAC). This report was passed on by English to Nimitz, who then sent it to Spruance. Spruance, a former submarine commander, was "understandably furious" at the vagueness of Murphy's report, as it provided him with little more than suspicion and no concrete information on which to make his preparations.<ref name="Parshall & Tully, 359">harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=359</ref> Unaware of the exact location of Yamamoto's "Main Body" (a persistent problem since the time PBYs had first sighted the Japanese), Spruance was forced to assume the "four large ships" reported by ''Tambor'' represented the main invasion force and so he moved to block it, while staying convert|100|nmi northeast of Midway.<ref name="prange_320">Harvnb|Prange|Goldstein|Dillon|1982|p=320; Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=345.</ref>

In reality, the ships sighted by ''Tambor'' were the detachment of four cruisers and two destroyers Yamamoto had sent to bombard Midway. At 02:55, these ships received Yamamoto's order to retire and changed course to comply.<ref name="prange_320" /> At about the same time as this change of course, ''Tambor'' was sighted and during maneuvers designed to avoid a submarine attack, the heavy cruisers Ship|Japanese cruiser|Mogami|1934|2 and Ship|Japanese cruiser|Mikuma||2 collided, inflicting serious damage on ''Mogami'''s bow. The less severely damaged ''Mikuma'' slowed to convert|12|kn to keep pace.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=345–346, diagram 347, 348</ref> Only at 04:12 did the sky brighten enough for Murphy to be certain the ships were Japanese, by which time staying surfaced was hazardous and he dived<!--this is the correct Sub Force usage, do not change it--> to approach for an attack. The attack was unsuccessful and at around 06:00 he finally reported two westbound sclass-|Mogami|cruiser|1s, before diving again and playing no further role in the battle.<ref name="Blair 1975 246–247"/> Limping along on a straight course at 12&nbsp;knots—roughly one-third their top speed—''Mogami'' and ''Mikuma'' had been almost perfect targets for a submarine attack. As soon as ''Tambor'' returned to port, Spruance had Murphy relieved of duty and reassigned to a shore station, citing his confusing contact report, poor torpedo shooting during his attack run, and general lack of aggression, especially as compared to ''Nautilus'', the oldest of the 12 boats at Midway and the only one which had successfully placed a torpedo on target (albeit a dud).<ref name="Blair, 250"/><ref name="Parshall & Tully, 359"/><!-- because of some misleading reports Spruance thought there may have been a fifth carrier lurking to the north-west of Midway - the sighting of the cruisers did not influence Spruance's decision making: instead, he sent his carrier bombers to attack the non-existent carrier: it was these aircraft that later attacked the cruisers. --><!--Can you source it? -->

Over the following two days, several strikes were launched against the stragglers, first from Midway, then from Spruance's carriers. ''Mikuma'' was eventually sunk by Dauntlesses,<ref name="NatlGeo1999">Cite journal |last=Allen |first=Thomas B. |title=Return to the Battle of Midway |publisher=National Geographic |journal=Journal of the National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C. |volume=195 |issue=4 |pages=80–103 (p. 89) |date=April 1999 |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/midway |issn=0027-9358 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011120347/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/midway/ |archivedate=11 October 2009  </ref> while ''Mogami'' survived further severe damage to return home for repairs. The destroyers ship|Japanese destroyer|Arashio||2 and ship|Japanese destroyer|Asashio|1936|2 were also bombed and strafed during the last of these attacks.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=377</ref> Captain Richard E.

Meanwhile, salvage efforts on ''Yorktown'' were encouraging, and she was taken in tow by USS|Vireo|AM-52|6. In the late afternoon of 6 June, the Ship|Japanese submarine|I-168||6, which had managed to slip through the cordon of destroyers (possibly because of the large amount of debris in the water), fired a salvo of torpedoes, two of which struck ''Yorktown''. There were few casualties aboard, since most of the crew had already been evacuated, but a third torpedo from this salvo struck the destroyer USS|Hammann|DD-412|6, which had been providing auxiliary power to ''Yorktown''. ''Hammann'' broke in two and sank with the loss of 80 lives, mostly because her own depth charges exploded. With further salvage efforts deemed hopeless, the remaining repair crews were evacuated from ''Yorktown'', which sank just after 05:00 on 7 June.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=374–375, 383</ref>

Japanese and US casualties

By the time the battle ended, 3,057 Japanese had died. Casualties aboard the four carriers were:
''Akagi'': 267; ''Kaga'': 811; ''Hiryū'': 392; ''Soryū'': 711 (including Captain Yanagimoto, who chose to remain on board); a total of 2,181.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=476</ref> The heavy cruisers ''Mikuma'' (sunk; 700 casualties) and ''Mogami'' (badly damaged; 92) accounted for another 792 deaths.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=378, 380</ref>

In addition, the destroyers ''Arashio'' (bombed; 35) and ''Asashio'' (strafed by aircraft; 21) were both damaged during the air attacks which sank ''Mikuma'' and caused further damage to ''Mogami''. Floatplanes were lost from the cruisers ''Chikuma'' (3) and ''Tone'' (2). Dead aboard the destroyers ''Tanikaze'' (11), ''Arashi'' (1), ''Kazagumo'' (1) and the fleet oiler ''Akebono Maru'' (10) made up the remaining 23 casualties.refn|Japanese casualty figures for the battle were compiled by Sawaichi Hisae for her book ''Midowei Kaisen: Kiroku'' p. 550: the list was compiled from Japanese prefectural records and is the most accurate to date.<ref name="ParTulcas">Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=114, 365, 377–380, 476</ref>|group=nb

At the end of the battle, the U.S. lost the carrier ''Yorktown'' and a destroyer. 307 Americans had been killed, including Major general (United States)|Major General Clarence L.

Aftermath
File:Midway survivor on PBY.jpg|thumb|A rescued U.S. airman on Midway

After winning a clear victory, and as pursuit became too hazardous near Wake,<ref name=Blair247>Harvnb|Blair|1975|p=247</ref> American forces retired. Spruance once again withdrew to the east to refuel his destroyers and rendezvous with the carrier ''Saratoga'', which was ferrying much-needed replacement aircraft. Fletcher transferred his flag to ''Saratoga'' on the afternoon of 8 June and resumed command of the carrier force. For the remainder of that day and then 9 June, Fletcher continued to launch search missions from the three carriers to ensure the Japanese were no longer advancing on Midway. Late on 10 June a decision was made to leave the area and the American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor.<ref>Harvnb|Lundstrom|2006|pp=293–296</ref>

Historian Samuel Eliot Morison|Samuel E. Morison noted in 1949 that Spruance was subjected to much criticism for not pursuing the retreating Japanese, thus allowing their surface fleet to escape.<ref>Harvnb|Morison|1949|pp=142–143</ref> Clay Blair argued in 1975 that had Spruance pressed on, he would have been unable to launch his aircraft after nightfall, and his cruisers would have been overwhelmed by Yamamoto's powerful surface units, including ''Yamato''.<ref name=Blair247/> Furthermore, the American air groups had suffered considerable losses, including most of their torpedo bombers. This made it unlikely that they would be effective in an airstrike against the Japanese battleships, even if they had managed to catch them during daytime.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=330</ref> Also, by this time Spruance's destroyers were critically low on fuel.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=382</ref><ref name=Toll>harvnb|Toll|2012|p=471</ref>

On 10 June, the Imperial Japanese Navy conveyed to the military liaison conference an incomplete picture of the results of the battle. Chūichi Nagumo's detailed battle report was submitted to the high command on 15 June. It was intended only for the highest echelons in the Japanese Navy and government, and was guarded closely throughout the war. In it, one of the more striking revelations is the comment on the Mobile Force Commander's (Nagumo's) estimates: "The enemy is not aware of our plans (we were not discovered until early in the morning of the 5th at the earliest)."<ref>cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/Japan/IJN/rep/Midway/Nagumo/ |author=Chūichi Nagumo|title=CINC First Air Fleet Detailed Battle Report no. 6|date=June 1942</ref> In reality, the whole operation had been compromised from the beginning by American code-breaking efforts.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=92–93</ref>

The Japanese public and much of the military command structure were kept in the dark about the extent of the defeat: Japanese news announced a great victory. Only Emperor Hirohito and the highest Navy command personnel were accurately informed of the carrier and pilot losses. Consequently, even the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) continued to believe, for at least a short time, that the fleet was in good condition.<ref>Harvnb|Bix|2001|p=449</ref>

On the return of the Japanese fleet to Hashirajima on 14 June the wounded were immediately transferred to naval hospitals; most were classified as "secret patients", placed in isolation wards and quarantined from other patients and their own families to keep this major defeat secret.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=386</ref> The remaining officers and men were quickly dispersed to other units of the fleet and, without being allowed to see family or friends, were shipped to units in the South Pacific, where the majority died in battle.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=386–387</ref> None of the flag officers or staff of the Combined Fleet were penalized, with Nagumo later being placed in command of the rebuilt carrier force.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=388</ref>

As a result of the defeat, new procedures were adopted whereby more Japanese aircraft were refueled and re-armed on the flight deck, rather than in the hangars, and the practice of draining all unused fuel lines was adopted. The new carriers being built were redesigned to incorporate only two flight deck elevators and new firefighting equipment. More carrier crew members were trained in damage-control and firefighting techniques, although the losses later in the war of ''Shōkaku'', ''Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiyō||2'', and especially ''Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taihō||2'' suggest that there were still problems in this area.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=388–389</ref>

Replacement pilots were pushed through an abbreviated training regimen in order to meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=390–391</ref>

In contrast, the extensive use of machinery in the United States meant that a much larger portion of the population had a mechanical/technical background.<ref name="Partull417" />|group=nb A few months after Midway, the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and it was these battles, combined with the constant attrition of veterans during the Solomons campaign, which were the catalyst for the sharp downward spiral in operational capability.<ref name="Partul4167">Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=416–417, 432</ref>

After the battle, ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku'' were the only large carriers of the original Pearl Harbor strike force left for offensive actions. Of Japan's other carriers, ''Taihō'', which was not commissioned until early 1944, would be the only fleet carrier worth teaming with ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku''; Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ryūjō||2 and ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuihō||2 were light carriers, while Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Jun'yō||2 and ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiyō||2, although technically classified as fleet carriers, were second-rate ships of comparatively limited effectiveness.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|p=421</ref> In the time it took Japan to build three carriers, the U.S. Navy commissioned more than two dozen fleet and light fleet carriers, and numerous escort carriers.<ref>cite web | url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/economic.htm | title=Why Japan ''Really'' Lost The War | publisher=CombinedFleet.com | accessdate=23 July 2015</ref> By 1942 the United States was already three years into a shipbuilding program mandated by the Second Vinson Act, intended to make the navy larger than all the Axis navies combined, plus the British and French navies, which it was feared might fall into Axis hands.<ref>Harvnb|Davidson|1996|p=21</ref>

Both the United States and Japan accelerated the training of aircrew, but the United States had a more effective pilot rotation system, which meant that more veterans survived and went on to training or command billets, where they were able to pass on lessons they had learned in training, instead of remaining in combat, where errors were more likely to be fatal.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=390–392</ref>  By the time of the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, the Japanese had nearly rebuilt their carrier forces in terms of numbers, but their planes, many of which were obsolescent, were largely flown by inexperienced and poorly trained pilots.refn|Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shinano||2, commissioned on 19 November 1944, was only the fourth fleet carrier commissioned by Japan during the war, after ''Taihō'', ''Unryū'', and ''Amagi''.<ref>Harvnb|Chesneau|1980|pp=169–170, 183–184</ref>|group=nb

Midway showed the worth of pre-war naval cryptanalysis and intelligence-gathering. These efforts continued and were expanded throughout the war in both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters. Successes were numerous and significant. For instance, cryptanalysis made possible the Operation Vengeance|shooting down of Admiral Yamamoto's airplane in 1943.<ref name=Zimmerman>cite web |last1=Zimmerman |first1=Dwight Jon |title=Operation Vengeance: The Mission to Kill Admiral Yamamoto |url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/operation-vengeance-the-mission-to-kill-admiral-yamamoto/ |website=DefenseMediaNetwork |accessdate=27 August 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6b6Bgj4Bb?url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/operation-vengeance-the-mission-to-kill-admiral-yamamoto/ |archivedate=27 August 2015 |deadurl=yes  </ref>

The Battle of Midway redefined the central importance of air superiority for the remainder of the war when the Japanese suddenly lost their four main aircraft carriers and were forced to return home. Without any form of air superiority, the Japanese never again launched a major offensive in the Pacific.<ref>Gordon W. Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'' (1982)</ref><ref>For the Japanese perspective see Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully, ''Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway'' (2005)</ref>

Discovery of sunken vessels
Because of the extreme depth of the ocean in the area of the battle (more than convert|17000|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or), researching the battlefield has presented extraordinary difficulties. On 19 May 1998, Robert Ballard and a team of scientists and Midway veterans from both sides located and photographed ''Yorktown''. The ship was remarkably intact for a vessel that had sunk in 1942; much of the original equipment and even the original paint scheme were still visible.<ref>Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9806/04/yorktown.found/index.html|title=Titanic explorer finds Yorktown|date=4 June 1998|accessdate=1 July 2007|publisher=CNN</ref>

Ballard's subsequent search for the Japanese carriers was unsuccessful. In September 1999, a joint expedition between Nauticos Corp. and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office searched for the Japanese aircraft carriers. Using advanced renavigation techniques in conjunction with the ship's log of the submarine USS ''Nautilus'', the expedition located a large piece of wreckage, subsequently identified as having come from the upper hangar deck of ''Kaga''. The main wreck of ''Kaga'' has yet to be located.<ref>Harvnb|Parshall|Tully|2005|pp=491–493</ref>
