Social cognition is "a sub-topic of social psychology that focuses on how people process, store, and apply information about other people and social situations. It focuses on the role that cognitive processes play in social interactions."<ref>Cite journal |last=Park |first=Mina |last2= Song |first2=Jae-Jin |last3=Oh |first3=Seo Jin |last4=Shin |first4=Min-Sup |last5=Lee |first5=Jun Ho |last6=Oh |first6= Seung Ha |journal= BioMed Research International |language=en |volume=2015 |pages=1–7 |doi= 10.1155/2015/313274 |pmid= 26236723 |pmc= 4506840 |issn= 2314-6133 |title=The Relation between Nonverbal IQ and Postoperative CI Outcomes in Cochlear Implant Users: Preliminary Result |year=2015</ref>

More technically, social cognition refers to how people deal with conspecifics (members of the same species) or even across species (such as pet) information, include four stages: encoding, storage, retrieval, and processing. In the area of social psychology, social cognition refers to a specific approach in which these processes are studied according to the methods of cognitive psychology and information processing theory. According to this view, social cognition is a level of analysis that aims to understand social psychological phenomena by investigating the cognitive processes that underlie them.<ref>(International Social Cognition Network: http://www.socialcognition.info)</ref> The major concerns of the approach are the processes involved in the perception, judgment, and memory of social stimuli; the effects of social and affective factors on information processing; and the behavioral and interpersonal consequences of cognitive processes. This level of analysis may be applied to any content area within social psychology, including research on intrapersonal, interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup processes.

The term ''social cognition'' has been used in multiple areas in psychology and Social cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscience, most often to refer to various social abilities disrupted in autism,<ref name="Striano">cite book|title=Social Cognition: Development, Neuroscience and Autism|editor=Striano, T.|editor2=Reid, V.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-6217-3|year=2009</ref> schizophrenia<ref name="Billeke-Aboitiz-2013">Cite journal  | last1 =Billeke | first1 = P. | last2 = Aboitiz | first2 = F.  | title = Social cognition in schizophrenia: from social stimuli processing to social engagement| journal =Frontiers in Psychiatry  | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = eCollection 2013 |date=February 2013 | doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00004 | pmid = 23444313 | pmc=3580762</ref> and other disorders.<ref name="BlairMitchellBlair">cite book|title=Psychopathy, emotion and the brain|last=Blair|first=J.|author2=Mitchel, D. |author3=Blair, K.  |year=2005|isbn=978-0-631-23336-7|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=25–7</ref> In cognitive neuroscience the biological basis of social cognition is investigated.<ref>cite journal|author1=Cacioppo, J.T.|author2=Berntson, G.G.|author3=Sheridan, J.F.|author4=McClintock, M.K.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Multilevel integrative analyses of human behavior: social neuroscience and the complementing nature of social and biological approaches|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=126|issue=6|pages=829–43|pmid=11107878|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.6.829|url=http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbsm00.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806233305/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbsm00.pdf|archivedate=2015-08-06|df=</ref><ref>cite journal|author=Cacioppo, J.T.|year=2002|title=Social neuroscience: understanding the pieces fosters understanding the whole and vice versa|journal=American Psychologist|volume=57|issue=11|pages=819–31|pmid=12564179|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.57.11.819</ref><ref>cite journal|last=Adolphs|first=R.|title=Social cognition and the human brain|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|pages=469–79|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01399-6|pmid=10562726|issue=12|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.7847</ref> Developmental psychologists study the development of social cognition abilities.<ref name="Shaffer">cite book|title= Developmental Psychology: Childhood and Adolescence|last=Shaffer |first=D.R.|author2=Kipp, K. |isbn=978-0-495-60171-5|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|chapter=Chapter 12: Theories of social and cognitive development |year=2009</ref>

Historical development
Social cognition came to prominence with the rise of cognitive psychology in the late 1960s and early 1970s and is now the dominant model and approach in mainstream social psychology.<ref name=Husain>cite book|title= Social Psychology|last=Husain |first=A. |isbn=9788131760000 |publisher=Pearson Education|Pearson Education India|chapter=Chapter 5: Social Perception and Cognition |year=2012</ref> Common to social cognition theories is the idea that information is represented in the brain as "mentalism (psychology)|cognitive elements" such as schema (psychology)|schemas, attribution theory|attributions, or stereotypes. A focus on how these cognitive elements are processed is often employed. Social cognition therefore applies and extends many themes, theories, and paradigms from cognitive psychology that can be identified in cognitive bias|reasoning (representativeness heuristic, base rate fallacy and confirmation bias), attention (automaticity and priming (psychology)|priming) and memory (schemas, primacy effect|primacy and recency). It is likely that social psychology has always had a more cognitive than general psychology approach, as it traditionally discussed internal mental states such as beliefs and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by behaviorism.<ref name="Fiske">cite book|last=Fiske|first=S.T.|author2=Taylor, S.E. |title=Social Cognition |isbn=978-0-07-100910-2|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc.|year=1991</ref>

One notable theory of social cognition is social schema theory, although it is not the basis of all social cognition studies (for example, see attribution theory).<ref name="Fiske"/> It has been suggested that other disciplines in social psychology such as social identity theory and social representations may be seeking to explain largely the same phenomena as social cognition, and that these different disciplines might be merged into a "coherent integrated whole".<ref>cite book|last=Augustinos|first=M. |author2=Walker, I. |author3=Donaghue, N.|title=Social Cognition an Integrated Introduction|isbn=978-0-7619-4218-4|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd|year=2006|location=London</ref> A parallel paradigm has arisen in the study of action, termed motor cognition, which is concerned with understanding the representation of action and the associated process.

Social schemas
Social schema theory builds on and uses terminology from schema theory in cognitive psychology, which describes how ideas or "concepts" are representation (psychology)|represented in the brain and how they are categorized. According to this view, when we see or think of a concept a mental representation or schema (psychology)|schema is "activated" bringing to mind other information which is linked to the original concept by association. This activation often happens unconsciously. As a result of activating such schemas, judgements are formed which go beyond the information actually available, since many of the associations the schema evokes extend outside the given information. This may influence social cognition and behaviour regardless of whether these judgements are accurate or not. For example, if an individual is introduced as a teacher, then a "teacher schema" may be activated. Subsequently, we might associate this person with wisdom or authority, or past experiences of teachers that we remember and consider important.

When a schema is more accessible it can be more quickly activated and used in a particular situation. Two cognitive processes that increase accessibility of schemas are salience (neuroscience)|salience and priming (psychology)|priming. Salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation. The higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible. For example, if there is one female in a group of seven males, female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the group's thinking and behavior toward the female group member.<ref name="Fiske"/> Priming refers to any experience immediately prior to a situation that causes a schema to be more accessible. For example, watching a scary movie late at night might increase the accessibility of frightening schemas, increasing the likelihood that a person will perceive shadows and background noises as potential threats.

Social cognition researchers are interested in how new information is integrated into pre-established schemas, especially when the information contrasts with the existing schema.<ref>cite journal|last=Alpay |first=L.|author2=Verhoef, J. |author3=Teeni, D. |author4=Putter, H. |author5=Toussaint, P. |author6= Zwetsloot-Schonk, J.  |year=2008 |title=Can contextualisation increase understanding during man-machine communication? A theory driven study |journal=The Open Medical Informatics Journal |volume=2 |pages=82–91|doi=10.2174/1874431100802010082|pmid=19415137|pmc=2669642</ref> For example, a student may have a pre-established schema that all teachers are assertive and bossy. After encountering a teacher who is timid and shy, a social cognition researcher might be interested in how the student will integrate this new information with his/her existing teacher schema. Pre-established schemas tend to guide attention to new information, as people selectively attend to information that is consistent with the schema and ignore information that is inconsistent. This is referred to as a confirmation bias. Sometimes inconsistent information is sub-categorized and stored away as a special case, leaving the original schema intact without any alterations. This is referred to as subtyping.

Social cognition researchers are also interested in the regulation of activated schemas. It is believed that the situational activation of schemas is automatic, meaning that it is outside individual conscious control.citation needed|date=May 2017 In many situations however, the schematic information that has been activated may be in conflict with the social norms of the situation in which case an individual is motivated to social inhibition|inhibit the influence of the schematic information on their thinking and social behavior.citation needed|date=May 2017 Whether a person will successfully regulate the application of the activated schemas is dependent on individual differences in self-regulatory ability and the presence of situational impairments to executive control.citation needed|date=May 2017 High self-regulatory ability and the lack of situational impairments on executive functioning increase the likelihood that individuals will successfully inhibit the influence of automatically activated schemas on their thinking and social behavior.citation needed|date=May 2017 When people stop suppressing the influence of the unwanted thoughts, a rebound effect can occur where the thought becomes hyper-accessible.citation needed|date=May 2017

Cultural differences
Social psychologists have become increasingly interested in the influence of culture on social cognition.<ref name= "Aronson">cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |author2=Wilson, T |author3=Akert, R.|title=Social Psychology |publisher=Pearson |chapter=Chapter 3: Social Cognition |year=2010</ref> Although people of all cultures use schemas to understand the world, the content of schemas has been found to differ for individuals based on their cultural upbringing. For example, one study interviewed a Scottish settler and a Bantu herdsman from Swaziland and compared their schemas about cattle.<ref name=Bartlett>cite book |title= Remembering |last=Bartlett |first=F. |publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press |page=249 |year=1932</ref> Because cattle are essential to the lifestyle of the Bantu people, the Bantu herdsmen's schemas for cattle were far more extensive than the schemas of the Scottish settler. The Bantu herdsmen was able to distinguish his cattle from dozens of others, while the Scottish settler was not.

Cultural influences have been found to shape some of the basic ways in which people automatically perceive and think about their environment.<ref name= "Aronson" /> For example, a number of studies have found that people who grow up in East Asian cultures such as China and Japan tend to develop holistic thinking styles, whereas people brought up in Western cultures like Australia and the USA tend to develop analytic thinking styles.<ref name= "Nisbett">cite journal |last=Nisbett |first=R. |author2=Peng, K. |author3=Choi, I. |author4= Norenzayan, A.  |title=Culture and Systems of thought: Holistic vs. analytic cognition |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |pages=291–310 |year=2001 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.291 |pmid=11381831 |issue=2</ref><ref name = "Masuda 2006">cite journal|authorlink1=Takahiko Masuda |last1=Masuda |first1=T. |last2=Nisbett|first2=R. |title=Culture and change blindness |journal=Cognitive Science: A Multidisciplinary Journal. |volume=30 |pages=381–389 |year=2006 |doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0000_63 |pmid=21702819 |issue=2</ref> The typically Eastern holistic thinking style is a type of thinking in which people focus on the overall context and the ways in which objects relate to each other.<ref name= "Nisbett" /> For example, if an Easterner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling then he/she might scan everyone's face in the class, and then use this information to judge how the individual is feeling.<ref name = "Masuda 2008">cite journal |last=Masuda |first=T. |author2=Ellsworth, P. C.|authorlink2=Phoebe C. Ellsworth|authorlink3=Batja Mesquita |author3=Mesquita, B.  |title=Placing the face in context: Cultural differences in the perception of facial emotion |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=94 |pages=365–381 |year=2008 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.3.365 |pmid=18284287 |issue=3</ref> On the other hand, the typically Western analytic thinking style is a type of thinking style in which people focus on individual objects and neglect to consider the surrounding context.<ref name= "Masuda 2006" /> For example, if a Westerner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling, then he or she might focus only on the classmate's face in order to make the judgment.<ref name = "Masuda 2008" />

Nisbett (2003) suggested that cultural differences in social cognition may stem from the various philosophical traditions of the East (i.e. Confucianism and Buddhism) versus the Greek philosophical traditions (i.e. of Aristotle and Plato) of the West.<ref name= "Aronson" /> However, recent research indicates that differences in social cognition may originate from physical differences in the environments of the two cultures. One study found that scenes from Japanese cities were 'busier' than those in the USA as they contain more objects which compete for attention. In this study, the Eastern holistic thinking style (and focus on the overall context) was attributed to the busier nature of the Japanese physical environment.<ref>cite journal |last=Miyamoto |first=Y. |author2=Kitayama, S.  |title=Cultural variation in correspondence bias: The critical role of attitude diagnosticity of socially constrained behaviour |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=83 |pages=1239–1248 |year=2002 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.5.1239 |pmid=12416925 |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.319.6787 </ref>

Early interest in the relationship between brain function and social cognition includes the case of Phineas Gage, whose behaviour was reported to have changed after an accident damaged one or both of his frontal lobes. More recent neuropsychological studies have shown that acquired brain injury|brain injuries disrupt social cognitive processes.

The development of social cognitive processes in infants and children has also been researched extensively (see developmental psychology). For example, it has been suggested that some aspects of psychological processes that promote social behavior (such as Face perception|facial recognition) may be psychological nativism|innate. Consistent with this, very young babies recognize and selectively respond to social stimuli such as the voice, face and scent of their mother.<ref>cite book |last=Bremner |first=J.G. |title=Infancy |pages=182–3 |chapter=Chapter 5: Social Development |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-631-14809-8.</ref>
