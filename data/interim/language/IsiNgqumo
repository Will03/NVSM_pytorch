IsiNgqumo is a Nguni languages|Nguni language and seems to have derived from Zulu language|Zulu. IsiNgqumo is often considered a Western invention by indigenous Zimbabweans but it was actually a creation of indigenous homosexuals, an only recently self-aware group.<ref name=Epprecht/>

Sample
Although the following sample conversation may be slightly obscene, it is a good representative of IsiNgqumo's use as most of its vocabulary has some connection to sex or gay men.<ref name=CameronGevisser>cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Edwin|author1-link=Edwin Cameron|last2=Gevisser|first2=Mark|author2-link=Mark Gevisser|title=Defiant Desire: Gay and Lesbian Lives in South Africa|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136656026|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8RzeAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=25 June 2014</ref>

IsiNgqumo:
:"''Isiphukwana sake, kuyavuswa na?''"
:"''Maye''"
:"''Injini!''"
:"''Kuncishiwe''" (or) "''kuyapholwa''"

Zulu translation (to show difference):
:"''Ubolo sake, kuyakhulu na?''"
:"''Yebo''"
:"''Imbuqo!''"
:"''Kuyancane''"

English (literal translation):
:"His little stick, has it awoken?"
:"Yes"
:"Lie!"
:"It's not talented" (or) "it makes one cold"

English translation:
:"His penis, is it big?"
:"Yes"
:"Lie!"
:"It's small" (both terms mean the same thing, and are very derogatorywhy|date=December 2015)

=Etymology=
The origin of the vocabulary used in the above sample is given below:<ref name=CameronGevisser/>
*The word ''isiphukwana'' comes from the Zulu word ''uphuku'' (meaning "stick") with the suffix "-ana" (meaning "small"). ''Iisiphukwana'' is the IsiNgqumo variant of the Zulu word ''uphukwana''.
*''Vuswa'' is the Zulu word for "woken up" in the passive tense.
*''Maye'' comes from the Zulu word for expressing shock. This is used instead of the Zulu word for yes, ''yebo''.
*''Injini'' literally means "taking on for a ride", and finds its origins in the Zulu word for "engine". In Zulu, the word ''imbuqo'' word is used for the same purpose.
*The word ''uncishiwe'' originates from Zulu as "not given", but is used in IsiNgqumo to mean "not talented". ''Kuncishiwe'' has the same meaning as "It is not talented". ''Uncishiwe'' can also mean "ugly", or can be used as a generic insult.
*''Pholwa'' is passive tense for the Zulu word for "cool". ''Kuyapholwa'' could be translated as "it makes one cool". Like ''ncishiwe'', ''pholwa'' can be used as an insult.
