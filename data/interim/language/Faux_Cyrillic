File:Shzdya.JPG|thumb|Faux Russian T-shirt print "ШЗ́ДЯ" (WEAR). A Russian language|Russian-speaker would read this as "''shzdya''", a word which does not occur in the language.

An early example was the logo for Norman Jewison's film ''The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming'' and more recently the logo for Sacha Baron Cohen's film ''Borat''.  In the music industry, the Simple Minds album ''Empires and Dance'' and the Spandau Ballet album ''Journeys to Glory'', both 1981, provide examples in the Album cover|cover artwork (the former with reversed ''Rs'' and ''Ns'' yielding ''Я'' and ''И'', the latter with ''Д'' and ''Ф'' replacing ''A'' and ''O'', respectively).

Letters are substituted regardless of phonetic matching. For example, ''R'' and ''N'' in ''RUSSIAN'' may be replaced by Cyrillic Ya (Cyrillic)|Я and I (Cyrillic)|И, giving "ЯUSSIAИ". Other examples include Sha (Cyrillic)|Ш for portraited E, Tse (Cyrillic)|Ц for U, Я/Ge (Cyrillic)|Г for R/backwards and upside-down L, Ef (Cyrillic)|Ф for O, De (Cyrillic)|Д for A, Б, Ь, or Ъ for B/b, З, Э, or Ё for E, Che (Cyrillic)|Ч or У for Y.  Outside the Russian alphabet, Џ (Yugoslavian) can act as a substitute for U, Ғ (USSR Turkic languages) for F, Ә (USSR Turkic languages) or Є (Ukrainian) for E, Ө (USSR Turkic languages) for O, Һ (Some USSR Turkic languages) for H, and Ћ (Yugoslavian) for Th. A reversed Hammer and Sickle|☭ is also sometimes used for G.<ref>A reversed hammer and sickle is used for the word-finishing Gs on the poster for ''The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming|The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming'', as can be seen :File:Russians are coming.jpg|here.

IPA notice

This effect is usually restricted to text set in all caps, because Cyrillic letter-forms do not match well with lower case Latin letters. In Cyrillic script#Letterforms and typography|Cyrillic typography, most upright lower case letters resemble small caps|smaller upper case letters, unlike the more distinctive forms of Latin-alphabet type. Cursive Cyrillic upper and lower case letters are more differentiated. Cyrillic letter-forms were derived from 10th-century Greek alphabet|Greek, but the modern forms have more closely resembled those in the Latin alphabet since Peter the Great's Reforms of Russian orthography|civil script reform of 1708.

The letters А, В, Е, Ѕ*, І*, Ј*, К, М, Н, О, Р, С, Т, Ү*, Ғ*, and Х are strongly homoglyphic or related to Latin letters, depending on intended sound values to the point that their substitution may not be noticed, unlike those listed above. If compatibility issues arise that limit mixing of scripts, these can be used with faux Cyrillic letters in lieu of their Latin counterparts. In addition, C may be replaced by the archaic Ҁ (letters with a *, however, are not used in the Russian Cyrillic alphabet.)

The letter Ѵ was already outmoded in Russian by the time of the 1917 Revolution and is consequently seldom used in faux Cyrillic in spite of its resemblance to Latin V.
