Gender transposition is a term in linguistics to describe the substitution of a gendered personal pronoun for the other gendered form.  When used to describe a woman, this would be using the pronouns ''his'' or ''him'' instead of ''her'', and ''he'' instead of ''she''.  For men, it would be the reverse.

Often used in the Cryptolect|argot of gay men, it can be intended either as a put-down, a self-mocking appellation, a term of endearment, or neutrally.  It may be considered gay bashing or homophobic when used by heterosexual people to mock a gay person.
