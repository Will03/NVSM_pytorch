In linguistics, an eggcorn is an idiosyncratic substitution of a word or phrase for a word or words that sound similar or identical in the speaker's dialect (sometimes called  Juncture#Oronyms|oronyms). The new phrase introduces a meaning that is different from the original but plausible in the same context, such as "old-timers' disease" for "Alzheimer's disease".<ref>cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title =eggcorn ''n.'' |encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=fifth |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=Boston |isbn=0-547-04101-2 </ref> An eggcorn can be described as an intra-lingual phono-semantic matching, a matching in which the intended word and substitute are from the same language.  

Etymology
The term ''eggcorn'' was coined by professor of linguistics Geoffrey Pullum in September 2003 in response to an article by Mark Liberman on the website Language Log, a blog for linguists.<ref>cite news

Pullum suggested using "eggcorn" itself as a label.

Similar phenomena
An eggcorn differs from  a malapropism, the latter being a substitution that creates a nonsensical phrase. Classical malapropisms generally derive their comic effect from the fault of the user, while eggcorns are substitutions that exhibit creativity, logic<ref name=PsyTod>cite journal |last=Peters |first=Mark |title=Word Watch: The Eggcorn – Lend Me Your Ear |journal=Psychology Today |volume=39 |issue=2 |page=18 |date=March–April 2006 |deadurl=yes |url=http://psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20060214-000002.html |accessdate=2006-07-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709191315/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20060214-000002.html |archivedate=2006-07-09 |df= </ref>Scientific citation needed|date=November 2017 or ignorance.

The phenomenon is similar to the form of wordplay known as the pun except that, by definition, the speaker or writer intends the pun to have some humorous effect on the recipient, whereas one who speaks or writes an eggcorn is unaware.<ref>cite web|title=LADY MONDEGREEN SAYS HER PEACE ABOUT EGG CORNS|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000074.html|date=2 Nov 2003|first=Arnold|last=Zwicky</ref>

It is also similar to, but differs from, mondegreens or a folk etymology.<ref name="Snowclone_Def">cite web |url= http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000061.html |title=Phrases for lazy writers in kit form |date=October 27, 2003 |first=Geoffrey K |last=Pullum |authorlink=Geoffrey Pullum |publisher=Language Log |accessdate=November 25, 2007</ref>
