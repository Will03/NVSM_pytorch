Cursive hieroglyphs were used for Ancient Egyptian literature|religious literature on papyrus and wood. The later hieratic and demotic (Egyptian)|demotic Egyptian scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing.

The use of hieroglyphic writing arose from proto-writing|proto-literate symbol systems in the Early Bronze Age, around the 32nd century BC (Naqada III),<ref name=Mattessich /> with the first decipherable sentence written in the Egyptian language dating to the Second Dynasty (28th century BC). Egyptian hieroglyphs developed into a mature writing system used for monumental inscription in the Middle Egyptian language|classical language of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom period; during this period, the system made use of about 900 distinct signs. The use of this writing system continued through the New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom and Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period, and on into the Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Persian and Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic periods. Late survivals of hieroglyphic use are found well into the Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period, extending into the 4th century AD.<ref name="Last hieroglyph" />

With the Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism#Final decline|final closing of pagan temples in the 5th century, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was lost. Although attempts were made, the script remained undeciphered throughout the Middle Ages and the early modern period. The Decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs|decipherment of hieroglyphic writing would only be accomplished in the 1820s by Jean-François Champollion, with the help of the Rosetta Stone.

Etymology
The word ''hieroglyph'' comes from the Ancient Greek|Greek adjective lang|grc|ἱερογλυφικός (''hieroglyphikos''),<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Di%28eroglufiko%2Fs ἱερογλυφικός],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> a Compound (linguistics)|compound of lang|grc|ἱερός (transl|grc|hierós 'sacred')<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Di%28ero%2Fs ἱερός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> and γλύφω (''glýphō'' 'Ι carve, engrave'; see ''glyph'').<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dglu%2Ffw γλύφω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref>

The glyphs themselves since the Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic period were called lang|grc|τὰ ἱερογλυφικὰ [γράμματα] (''tà hieroglyphikà [grámmata]'') "the sacred engraved letters", the Greek counterpart to the Egyptian expression of ''mdw.w-nṯr'' "god's words".<ref name=Loprieno11>Antonio Loprieno, ''Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction'' (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995), p. 11.</ref> Greek lang|grc|ἱερογλυφός meant "a carver of hieroglyphs".

In English, ''hieroglyph'' as a noun is recorded from 1590, originally short for nominalised ''hieroglyphic'' (1580s, with a plural ''hieroglyphics''), from adjectival use (''hieroglyphic character'').<ref>cite web |title=Hieroglyphic &#124; Definition of Hieroglyphic by Merriam-Webster |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hieroglyphic |accessdate=2016-08-27</ref>

History and evolution
=Origin=
File:Peribsen.JPG|thumb|Seal impression of Seth-Peribsen (Second Dynasty, c. 28th century BC)
Hieroglyphs emerged from the preliterate artistic traditions of Egypt. For example, symbols on Gerzean pottery from c. 4000 BC have been argued to resemble hieroglyphic writing.citation needed|date=November 2016 Proto-writing|Proto-hieroglyphic symbol systems develop in the second half of the 4th millennium BC, such as the clay labels of a Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic ruler called "Scorpion I" (Naqada IIIA period, c. 33rd century BC) recovered at Abydos, Egypt|Abydos (modern Umm el-Qa'ab) in 1998 or the Narmer Palette (c. 31st century BC).<ref name=Mattessich>cite journal|author=Richard Mattessich|year=2002|title=The oldest writings, and inventory tags of Egypt|journal=Accounting Historians Journal|jstor=40698264|volume=29|issue=1|pages=195–208|url=https://aprendeenlinea.udea.edu.co/revistas/index.php/cont/article/viewFile/25609/21149</ref> 
The first full sentence written in hieroglyphs so far discovered was found on a seal impression found in the tomb of Seth-Peribsen at Umm el-Qa'ab, which dates from the Second dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty (28th or 27th century BC). There are around 800 hieroglyphs dating back to the Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom Eras. By the Greco-Roman period, there are more than 5,000.<ref name=Loprieno12/>

=Mature writing system=
see|Middle Egyptian language
Hieroglyphs consist of three kinds of glyphs: phonetic glyphs, including single-consonant characters that function like an alphabet; logographs, representing morphemes; and determinatives, which narrow down the semantics|meaning of logographic or phonetic words.

File:Heiroglyphs.jpg|thumb|Hieroglyphs on a funerary stela in Manchester Museum

=Late Period=
see|Late Egyptian language
As writing developed and became more widespread among the Egyptian people, simplified glyph forms developed, resulting in the hieratic (priestly) and Demotic Egyptian|demotic (popular) scripts. These variants were also more suited than hieroglyphs for use on papyrus. Hieroglyphic writing was not, however, eclipsed, but existed alongside the other forms, especially in monumental and other formal writing. The Rosetta Stone contains three parallel scripts – hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek.

=Late survival=
Hieroglyphs continued to be used under Persian rule (intermittent in the 6th and 5th centuries BC), and after Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt, during the ensuing Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic and Ancient Rome|Roman periods. It appears that the misleading quality of comments from Greek and Roman writers about hieroglyphs came about, at least in part, as a response to the changed political situation. Some believed that hieroglyphs may have functioned as a way to distinguish 'true Egyptians' from some of the foreign conquerors. Another reason may be the refusal to tackle a foreign culture on its own terms, which characterized Greco-Roman approaches to Egyptian culture generally.citation needed|date=November 2016 Having learned that hieroglyphs were sacred writing, Greco-Roman authors imagined the complex but rational system as an allegorical, even magical, system transmitting secret, mystical knowledge.<ref name="Last hieroglyph" />

By the 4th century, few Egyptians were capable of reading hieroglyphs, and the "myth of allegorical hieroglyphs" was ascendant.<ref name="Last hieroglyph" /> Monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased after the closing of all non-Christian temples in 391 by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I; the last known inscription is from Philae, known as the Graffito of Esmet-Akhom, from 394.<ref name="Last hieroglyph" /><ref>The latest presently known hieroglyphic inscription date: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070815135548/http://academic.memphis.edu/egypt/l0039.gif Birthday of Osiris] Webarchive|url= |date=2007-08-15 , year 110 [of Diocletian], dated to August 24, 394</ref>

The ''Hieroglyphica'' of Horapollo (c. 5th century) appears to retain some genuine knowledge about the writing system. It offers an explanation of close to 200 signs.
Some are identified correctly, such as the "goose" hieroglyph (''zꜣ'') representing the word for "son".<ref name="Last hieroglyph" />

Decipherment
Main|Decipherment of hieroglyphic writing
File:Ibn Wahshiyya's 985 CE translation of the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph alphabet.jpg|thumb|Ibn Wahshiyya's translation of the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph alphabet
Knowledge of the hieroglyphs had been lost completely by the medieval period. 
Early attempts at decipherment are due to Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya (9th and 10th century, respectively).<ref>cite book|author=Ahmed ibn 'Ali ibn al Mukhtar ibn 'Abd al Karim (called Ibn Wahshiyah)|title=Ancient alphabets & hieroglyphic characters explained: with an account of the Egyptian priests, their classes, initiation time, & sacrifices by the aztecs and their birds, in the Arabic language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MKvYqEEboTYC|accessdate=31 October 2011|year=1806|publisher=W. Bulmer & co.</ref>

All medieval and early modern attempts were hampered by the fundamental assumption that hieroglyphs 
recorded ideas and not the sounds of the language. 
As no bilingual texts were available, any such symbolic 'translation' could be proposed without the possibility of verification.<ref>Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13384397&search_terms=DTL60|title=Tabula Aegyptiaca hieroglyphicis exornata|last=|first=|work=Acta Eruditorum|publisher=|year=1714|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=127</ref> It wasn't until Athanasius Kircher in the mid 17th cent. that scholars began to think the hieroglyphs might also represent sounds. Kircher was familiar with Coptic, and thought that it might be the key to deciphering the hieroglyphs, but was held back by a belief in the mystical nature of the symbols.<ref name="Last hieroglyph" />

File:rosetta stone.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Rosetta Stone in the British Museum
The breakthrough in decipherment came only with the discovery of the Rosetta Stone by Napoleon's troops in 1799 (during French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|Napoleon's Egyptian invasion). 
As the stone presented a hieroglyphic and a demotic version of the same text in parallel with a Greek translation, plenty of material for falsifiable studies in translation was suddenly available. In the early 19th century, scholars such as Silvestre de Sacy, Johan David Åkerblad, and Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young studied the inscriptions on the stone, and were able to make some headway. Finally, Jean-François Champollion made the complete decipherment by the 1820s. In his ''Lettre à M. Dacier'' (1822), he wrote:

<blockquote>It is a complex system, writing figurative, symbolic, and phonetic all at once, in the same text, the same phrase, I would almost say in the same word.<ref>Jean-François Champollion, <cite>Letter to Bon-Joseph Dacier|M. Dacier</cite>, September 27, 1822</ref></blockquote>
File:Acta Eruditorum - I geroglifici, 1714 – BEIC 13384397.jpg|thumb|Illustration from ''Tabula Aegyptiaca hieroglyphicis exornata'' published in Acta Eruditorum, 1714
Hieroglyphs survive today in two forms: directly, through half a dozen Demotic glyphs added to the Greek alphabet when writing Coptic alphabet|Coptic; and indirectly, as the inspiration for the Middle Bronze Age alphabets|original alphabet that was ancestral to nearly every other alphabet ever used, including the Latin alphabet.

Writing system
IPA notice

Visually, hieroglyphs are all more or less figurative: they represent real or illusional elements, sometimes stylized and simplified, but all generally perfectly recognizable in form. However, the same sign can, according to context, be interpreted in diverse ways: as a phonogram (Phonetics|phonetic reading), as a logogram, or as an ideogram (semagram; "determinative") (Semantics|semantic reading). The determinative was not read as a phonetic constituent, but facilitated understanding by differentiating the word from its homophones.

=Phonetic reading=
File:Egypt Hieroglyphe4.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Hieroglyphs typical of the Graeco-Roman period
Most non-determinative hieroglyphic signs are phonetic in nature, meaning that the sign is read independently of its visual characteristics (according to the rebus principle where, for example, the picture of an eye could stand for the English words ''eye'' and ''I'' [the first person pronoun]). This picture of an eye is called a phonogram of the word, 'I'.

Phonograms formed with one consonant are called ''Egyptian uniliteral signs|uniliteral'' signs; with two consonants, ''Egyptian biliteral signs|biliteral'' signs; with three, ''Egyptian triliteral signs|triliteral'' signs.

Twenty-four uniliteral signs make up the so-called hieroglyphic alphabet. Egyptian hieroglyphic writing does not normally indicate vowels, unlike cuneiform, and for that reason has been labelled by some an ''abjad'' alphabet, i.e., an alphabet without vowels.

Thus, hieroglyphic writing representing a northern pintail|pintail duck is read in Egyptian as ''sꜣ'', derived from the main consonants of the Egyptian word for this duck: 's', 'ꜣ' and 't'. (Note that ꜣ (File:Egyptian 3 symbol.png|10px|, two half-rings opening to the left), sometimes replaced by the digit '3', is the Egyptian ''Egyptian alef|alef'').

It is also possible to use the hieroglyph of the pintail duck without a link to its meaning in order to represent the two phonemes ''s'' and ''ꜣ'', independently of any vowels that could accompany these consonants, and in this way write the word: ''sꜣ'', "son", or when complemented by the context other signs detailed further in the text, ''sꜣ'', "keep, watch"; and ''sꜣṯ.w'', "hard ground". For example:

<hiero>G38</hiero>spaced ndashthe characters ''sꜣ'';

<hiero>G38-Z1s</hiero>spaced ndashthe same character used only in order to signify, according to the context, "pintail duck" or, with the appropriate determinative, "son", two words having the same or similar consonants; the meaning of the little vertical stroke will be explained further on:

<hiero>z:G38-A-A47-D54</hiero>spaced ndashthe character ''sꜣ'' as used in the word ''sꜣw'', "keep, watch"Clarify|date=June 2009|reason=please make this a clear English sentence: use "and", break up long sentence, and use correct punctuation, similar to the clearer examples below.

As in the Arabic alphabet|Arabic script, not all vowels were written in Egyptian hieroglyphs; it is debatable whether vowels were written at all. Possibly, as with Arabic, the semivowels IPA|/w/ and IPA|/j/ (as in English W and Y) could double as the vowels IPA|/u/ and IPA|/i/. In modern transcriptions, an ''e'' is added between consonants to aid in their pronunciation. For example, ''nfr'' "good" is typically written ''nefer''. This does not reflect Egyptian vowels, which are obscure, but is merely a modern convention. Likewise, the ''ꜣ'' and ʾ are commonly transliterated as ''a'', as in Ra.

Hieroglyphs are written from right to left, from left to right, or from top to bottom, the usual direction being from right to left<ref>Sir Alan H. Gardiner, <cite>''Egyptian Grammar'', Third Edition Revised</cite>, Griffith Institute (2005), p.25</ref> (although, for convenience, modern texts are often normalized into left-to-right order). The reader must consider the direction in which the asymmetrical hieroglyphs are turned in order to determine the proper reading order. For example, when human and animal hieroglyphs face to the left (i.e., they look left), they must be read from left to right, and vice versa, the idea being that the hieroglyphs face the beginning of the line.

As in many ancient writing systems, words are not separated by blanks or by punctuation marks. However, certain hieroglyphs appear particularly common only at the end of words, making it possible to readily distinguish words.

Uniliteral signs
File:Amada ( 110 miles south of Aswan, left bank ). Temple founded by Tuthmosis III.jpg|thumb|Hieroglyphs at Amada, at temple founded by Tuthmosis III.
Main|Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian#Uniliteral signs
The Egyptian hieroglyphic script contained 24 uniliterals (symbols that stood for single consonants, much like letters in English). It would have been possible to write all Egyptian words in the manner of these signs, but the Egyptians never did so and never simplified their complex writing into a true alphabet.<ref>cite book|author=Gardiner, Sir Alan H.|year=1973|title=Egyptian Grammar|publisher=Griffith Institute|isbn=978-0-900416-35-4</ref>

Each uniliteral glyph once had a unique reading, but several of these fell together as Old Egyptian developed into Middle Egyptian. For example, the folded cloth (s hieroglyph)|folded-cloth glyph seems to have been originally an voiceless alveolar fricative|/s/ and the door bolt (s hieroglyph)|door-bolt glyph a voiceless dental fricative|/θ/ sound, but these both came to be pronounced IPA|/s/, as the IPA|/θ/ sound was lost. A few uniliterals first appear in Middle Egyptian texts.

Besides the uniliteral glyphs, there are also the Egyptian biliteral signs|biliteral and Egyptian triliteral signs|triliteral signs, to represent a specific sequence of two or three consonants, consonants and vowels, and a few as vowel combinations only, in the language.

Phonetic complements
Egyptian writing is often redundant: in fact, it happens very frequently that a word might follow several characters writing the same sounds, in order to guide the reader. For example, the word ''nfr'', "beautiful, good, perfect", was written with a unique triliteral that was read as ''nfr'':
::::::::: <hiero>nfr</hiero>

However, it is considerably more common to add to that triliteral, the uniliterals for ''f'' and ''r''. The word can thus be written as ''nfr+f+r'', but one still reads it merely as ''nfr''. The two alphabetic characters are adding clarity to the spelling of the preceding triliteral hieroglyph.

Redundant characters accompanying biliteral or triliteral signs are called ''phonetic complements'' (or complementaries). They can be placed in front of the sign (rarely), after the sign (as a general rule), or even framing it (appearing both before and after). Ancient Egyptian scribes consistently avoided leaving large areas of blank space in their writing, and might add additional phonetic complements or sometimes even invert the order of signs if this would result in a more aesthetically pleasing appearance (good scribes attended to the artistic, and even religious, aspects of the hieroglyphs, and would not simply view them as a communication tool). Various examples of the use of phonetic complements can be seen below:

<blockquote>
: <hiero>S43-d-w</hiero> – ''md +d +w'' (the complementary ''d'' is placed after the sign) → it reads ''mdw'', meaning "tongue".

: <hiero>x:p-xpr:r-i-A40</hiero> – ''ḫ +p +ḫpr +r +j'' (the four complementaries frame the triliteral sign of the Dung beetle#Scarab in ancient Egypt|scarab beetle) → it reads ''ḫpr.j'', meaning the name "Khepri", with the final glyph being the determinative for 'ruler or god'.
</blockquote>

Notably, phonetic complements were also used to allow the reader to differentiate between signs that are homophones, or which do not always have a unique reading. For example, the symbol of "the seat" (or chair):

<blockquote>
: <hiero>Q1</hiero> – This can be read ''st'', ''ws'' and ''ḥtm'', according to the word in which it is found. The presence of phonetic complements—and of the suitable determinative—allows the reader to know which of the three readings to choose:

:*1st Reading: st – <hiero>Q1-t:pr</hiero> – ''st'', written ''st+t'' ; the last character is the determinative of "the house" or that which is found there, meaning "seat, throne, place";

<!-- EXAMPLE 1st Reading -->
::: <hiero>Q1-t:H8</hiero> – ''st'' (written ''st+t'' ; the "egg" determinative is used for female personal names in some periods), meaning "Isis";

:*2nd Reading: ws – <hiero>Q1:ir-A40</hiero> – ''wsjr'' (written ''ws''+''jr'', with, as a phonetic complement, "the eye", which is read ''jr'', following the determinative of "god"), meaning "Osiris";

:*3rd Reading: ḥtm – <hiero>H-Q1-m:t-E17</hiero> – ''ḥtm.t'' (written ''ḥ+ḥtm+m+t'', with the determinative of "Anubis" or "the jackal"), meaning a kind of wild animal;

<!-- EXAMPLE 3rd Reading -->
::: <hiero>H-Q1-t-G41</hiero> – ''ḥtm'' (written ''ḥ +ḥtm +t'', with the determinative of the flying bird), meaning "to disappear".
</blockquote>

Finally, it sometimes happens that the pronunciation of words might be changed because of their connection to Ancient Egyptian: in this case, it is not rare for writing to adopt a compromise in notation, the two readings being indicated jointly. For example, the adjective ''bnj'', "sweet", became ''bnr''. In Middle Egyptian, one can write:
::: <hiero>b-n:r-i-M30</hiero> – ''bnrj'' (written ''b+n+r+i'', with determinative)

which is fully read as ''bnr'', the ''j'' not being pronounced but retained in order to keep a written connection with the ancient word (in the same fashion as the English language words ''through'', ''knife'', or ''victuals'', which are no longer pronounced the way they are written.)

=Semantic reading=
Besides a phonetic interpretation, characters can also be read for their meaning: in this instance, logograms are being spoken (or ideograms) and ''semagrams'' (the latter are also called determinatives).<ref name=Loprieno13>Antonio Loprieno, <cite>Ancient Egyptian, A Linguistic Introduction</cite>, Cambridge University Press (1995), p. 13</ref>

Logograms
A hieroglyph used as a logogram defines the object of which it is an image. Logograms are therefore the most frequently used common nouns; they are always accompanied by a mute vertical stroke indicating their status as a logogram (the usage of a vertical stroke is further explained below); in theory, all hieroglyphs would have the ability to be used as logograms. Logograms can be accompanied by phonetic complements. Here are some examples:

:*<hiero>ra:Z1</hiero> – ''rꜥ'', meaning "sun";

:*<hiero>pr:Z1</hiero> – ''pr'', meaning "house";

:*<hiero>sw-t:Z1</hiero> – ''swt'' (''sw''+''t''), meaning "reed";

:*<hiero>Dw:Z1</hiero> – ''ḏw'', meaning "mountain".

In some cases, the semantic connection is indirect (metonymic or metaphoric):

:*<hiero>nTr-Z1</hiero> – ''nṯr'', meaning "god"; the character in fact represents a temple flag (standard);

:*<hiero>G53-Z1</hiero> – ''bꜣ'', meaning "Ba (Egyptian soul)|Bâ" (soul); the character is the traditional representation of a "bâ" (a bird with a human head);

:*<hiero>G27-Z1</hiero> – ''dšr'', meaning "flamingo"; the corresponding phonogram means "red" and the bird is associated by metonymy with this color.

Determinatives
Determinatives or semagrams (semantic symbols specifying meaning) are placed at the end of a word. These mute characters serve to clarify what the word is about, as homophone|homophonic glyphs are common. If a similar procedure existed in English, words with the same spelling would be followed by an indicator that would not be read, but which would fine-tune the meaning: "retort [chemistry]" and "retort [rhetoric]" would thus be distinguished.<!--

<div><!-- division to keep embedded hieroglyphs within text -->
A number of determinatives exist: divinities, humans, parts of the human body, animals, plants, etc. Certain determinatives possess a Literal and figurative language|literal and a figurative meaning. For example, a roll of papyrus, <hiero>Y1</hiero> &nbsp; is used to define "books" but also abstract ideas. The determinative of the plural is a shortcut to signal three occurrences of the word, that is to say, its plural (since the Egyptian language had a dual, sometimes indicated by two strokes). This special character is explained below.</div>

Here, are several examples of the use of determinatives borrowed from the book, ''Je lis les hiéroglyphes'' ("I am reading hieroglyphs") by Jean Capart, which illustrate their importance:

*<hiero>nfr-w-A17-Z3</hiero> – ''nfrw'' (''w'' and the three strokes are the marks of the plural: [literally] "the beautiful young people", that is to say, the young military recruits. The word has a child (hieroglyph)|young-person determinative symbol: <small><hiero>A17</hiero></small> – which is the determinative indicating babies and children;
*<hiero>nfr-f:r:t-B1</hiero> – ''nfr.t'' (''.t'' is here the suffix that forms the feminine): meaning "the nubile young woman", with <hiero>B1</hiero> as the determinative indicating a woman;
*<hiero>nfr-nfr-nfr-pr</hiero> – ''nfrw'' (the tripling of the character serving to express the plural, Inflection|flexional ending ''w'') : meaning "foundations (of a house)", with the house as a determinative, <hiero>pr</hiero>;
*<hiero>nfr-f:r-S28</hiero> – ''nfr'' : meaning "clothing" with <small><hiero>S28</hiero></small> &nbsp; as the determinative for lengths of cloth;
*<hiero>nfr-W22:Z2ss</hiero> – ''nfr'' : meaning "wine" or "beer"; with a jug <hiero>W22</hiero> &nbsp; as the determinative.

All these words have a meliorative connotation: "good, beautiful, perfect". The ''Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian'' by Raymond A. Faulkner, gives some twenty words that are read ''nfr'' or which are formed from this word.

=Additional signs=

Cartouche
Rarely, the names of gods are placed within a cartouche; the two last names of the sitting king are always placed within a cartouche:

<hiero>< N5:Z1-i-Y5:n-A40 ></hiero>
jmn-rꜥ, "Amon-Ra";

<hiero>< q:E23-i-V4-p:d:r-A-t:H8 ></hiero>
qljwꜣpdrꜣ.t, "Cleopatra";

Filling stroke
A filling stroke is a character indicating the end of a quadrat (hieroglyph block)|quadrat that would otherwise be incomplete.

=Signs joined together=
Some signs are the contraction of several others. These signs have, however, a function and existence of their own: for example, a forearm where the hand holds a scepter is used as a determinative for words meaning "to direct, to drive" and their derivatives.

Doubling
The doubling of a sign indicates its dual; the list of Egyptian hieroglyphs by common name: M-Z#P|tripling of a sign indicates its plural.

=Grammatical signs=
*The vertical stroke, indicating the sign is a logogram;
*The two strokes of the "dual" and the three strokes of the "plural";
*The direct notation of flexional endings, for example: <hiero>W</hiero> <!-- (Z7)-->

Spelling
Standard orthography—"correct" spelling—in Egyptian is much looser than in modern languages. In fact, one or several variants exist for almost every word. One finds:

*Redundancies;
*Omission of graphemes, which are ignored whether or not they are intentional;
*Substitutions of one grapheme for another, such that it is impossible to distinguish a "mistake" from an "alternate spelling";
*Errors of omission in the drawing of signs, which are much more problematic when the writing is cursive (hieratic) writing, but especially demotic, where the schematization of the signs is extreme.

However, many of these apparent spelling errors constitute an issue of chronology. Spelling and standards varied over time, so the writing of a word during the Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom might be considerably different during the New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom. Furthermore, the Egyptians were perfectly content to include older orthography ("historical spelling") alongside newer practices, as though it were acceptable in English to use archaic spellings in modern texts. Most often, ancient "spelling errors" are simply misinterpretations of context. Today, hieroglyphicists use numerous cataloguing systems (notably the ''Manuel de Codage'' and ''Gardiner's Sign List'') to clarify the presence of determinatives, ideograms, and other ambiguous signs in transliteration.

Simple examples
Hiero/1cartouche|align=left|era=ok|name=Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemy|nomen=<hiero>p:t-wA-l:M-i-i-s</hiero>

The glyphs in this cartouche are transliterated as:
{|
|- style="vertical-align:middle;" border="0"
| p<br />t
| "ua"
| l<br />m
| y (ii) s
|
|<br />
|<br />
Ptolmys
|}

though ''ii'' is considered a single letter and transliterated ''y''.

Another way in which hieroglyphs work is illustrated by the two Egyptian words pronounced ''pr'' (usually vocalised as ''per''). One word is 'house', and its hieroglyphic representation is straightforward:
<hiero>pr:Z1</hiero>
File:Name of Alexander the Great in Hieroglyphs circa 330 BCE.jpg|thumb|Name of Alexander the Great in hieroglyphs, circa|332&nbsp;BC, Egypt. Louvre Museum
Here, the 'house' hieroglyph works as a logogram: it represents the word with a single sign. The vertical stroke below the hieroglyph is a common way of indicating that a glyph is working as a logogram.

Another word ''pr'' is the verb 'to go out, leave'. When this word is written, the 'house' hieroglyph is used as a phonetic symbol:
<hiero>pr:r-D54</hiero>
Here, the 'house' glyph stands for the consonants ''pr''. The 'mouth' glyph below it is a ''phonetic complement:'' it is read as ''r'', reinforcing the phonetic reading of ''pr''. The third hieroglyph is a ''determinative'': it is an ideogram for verbs of motion that gives the reader an idea of the meaning of the word.

anchor|EncodingEncoding and font support
Egyptian hieroglyphs were added to the Unicode Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2 which introduced the Egyptian Hieroglyphs (Unicode block)|Egyptian Hieroglyphs block (U+13000–U+1342F) with 1,071 defined characters.

As of|2013|July, four fonts, [http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/ ''Aegyptus''], [http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~mjn/egyptian/fonts/newgardiner.html ''NewGardiner''], ''Noto fonts|Noto Sans Egyptian Hieroglyphs'' and [http://jsesh.qenherkhopeshef.org/en/node/1416 ''JSeshFont''] support this range. Another font, ''Segoe UI Historic'', comes bundled with Windows 10 and also contains glyphs for the Egyptian Hieroglyphs block (excluding U+130B8–130BA).
