The United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad (UKLO) is a linguistics competition for primary and secondary school students in the United Kingdom.<ref name="theyorker">cite web|url=http://www.theyorker.co.uk/news/campusnews/10970|title=Olympic flame burns for young linguists -  The Yorker|publisher=theyorker.co.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25</ref><ref name="all-languages">cite web|url=http://www.all-languages.org.uk/news/news_list/uk_linguistics_olympiad|title=UK Linguistics Olympiad|publisher=all-languages.org.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25</ref> The competition is divided into four levels: Breakthrough, Foundation, Intermediate and Advanced, collectively known as 'Round 1', with roughly 16 top-scoring entrants at Advanced level eligible for a follow-on round, called 'Round 2' and selection for participation in the International Linguistics Olympiad, one of the international science olympiads. In 2009, teams from two schools competed in a pilot competition, with the winners taking part in the international contest as guests of the All-Ireland Linguistics Olympiad. In 2010, an independent olympiad was created and has taken place every year since.

 History 

Problem-solving competitions in linguistics for secondary school students have been taking place around the world since the 1960s. In Russia, the Moscow and St Petersburg Linguistic Olympiads are credited with inspiring hundreds of young talented scholars to choose linguistics as an academic major and profession. Currently there are national contests within Europe, North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. There is also an International Linguistics Olympiad in which students from many countries compete, which began in 2003, and was first hosted by Bulgaria.

In 2009, two UK schools, the Manchester Grammar School and Downlands Community School, took part as guests in the Irish competition, and the winning team represented the UK at the International Olympiad. This triggered the foundation of a permanent committee for the UK Linguistics Olympiad, and the creation of a consortium of olympiads held in English-speaking countries, ELCLO, as a means for pooling resources with NACLO, AILO and Australian Computational and Linguistics Olympiad|OzCLO, the American, Irish and Australian Linguistics Olympiads respectively. The UKLO committee is chaired by Dick Hudson, with Neil Sheldon serving as vice-chair.

In 2010, 560 students from 28 schools entered, 223 at Foundation, and 337 at Advanced level. In 2011,  1165 entries were received from 49 schools, 349 at Foundation, and 816 at Advanced level. 2012 saw the introduction of the Intermediate level, with 1912 entries from 300 schools, 432 at Foundation, 498 at Intermediate and 982 at Advanced level. 2013 saw total entries number 2878, with 1069 at Foundation, 643 at Intermediate and 1166 at Advanced level. In 2015, a new, lowest entry level was introduced, called Breakthrough, with 96 entrants. By 2018, the numbers had increased to 220 in Breakthrough, 1042 at Foundation, 970 at Intermediate and 1650 at Advanced.

The Olympiad has sponsorship and support from various organisations including the British Academy,<ref>cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/news.cfm/newsid/457 |title=British Academy Sponsorship |accessdate=28 November 2013 |date=February 2011</ref> The Linguistics Association of Great Britain, The British Association for Applied Linguistics, The Philological Society, Routes into Languages,<ref name="routesintolanguages">cite web|url=https://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/cymru/news/2359|title=UK Linguistics Olympiad registration for 2012 &#124; Routes Into Languages|publisher=routesintolanguages.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25</ref> The School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics, Sheffield University and The School of Philosophy, Psychology & Language Sciences, Edinburgh University.

The UK has sent a delegation to the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) every year since 2009, and has competed in 10 olympiads. They have sent 60 participants in 15 teams, selected through UKLO. In competition, teams from the UK have brought home 27 medals (10 gold, 6 silver and 11 bronze), 3 team trophies (1 gold and 2 bronze), 1 first-place team cup, 3 best solution prizes, and 12 honourable mentions. In addition, the UK has sent 4 Repeat Medalists and 2 Dream Teams to the Hall of Fame.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.ioling.org/results/UK/ |title=The UK at the IOL: Results |accessdate=28 October 2013 |date=August 2013</ref>
The UK Linguistics Olympiad was the host for the 2013 IOL, held at the Manchester Grammar School and chaired by Neil Sheldon. The competition in Manchester was featured on an edition of BBC Radio Four's Word of Mouth programme centring on language games.<ref name="bbc">cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b038c7bs/Word_of_Mouth_Language_Games|title=BBC iPlayer - Word of Mouth: Language Games|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25</ref>

 Format 

The competition is divided into two rounds. Round 1 is open to all secondary school pupils, while Round 2 is invitation only.

10 linguistic data problems are posed in each year's Round 1 papers, with the Breakthrough paper being 1-3, Foundation 2-5, Intermediate 4-7, and Advanced 6-10. The intention is that each problem is harder than the previous. At Breakthrough, Foundation and Intermediate levels, participants may enter either individually or as part of a group of 2-4 students, and timings and conditions can be decided by schools. At the Advanced level, the competition must take the format of an individual, two and a half hour test sat under controlled conditions.

Roughly 16 of the top scorers from the Advanced paper are invited to participate in Round 2, which takes the form of a residential training weekend at a host university,<ref name="york">cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/language/news/events/uklo-2012/|title=uklo 2012 - Language and Linguistic Science, The University of York|publisher=york.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25</ref><ref name="smuc">cite web|url=http://www.smuc.ac.uk/news/news/school-of-communication-culture-and-creative-arts/2013/03/st-marys-hosts-the-finals-of-the-uk-linguistics-olympiad/|title=St Mary’s Hosts the Finals of the UK Linguistics Olympiad|publisher=smuc.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25</ref> followed by a three-hour test posing five more problems. Eight competitors in two teams from Round 2 are invited to participate in the International Linguistics Olympiad and represent the UK, with selection being based mostly on performance in the Round 2 paper, but past performances at IOL and Round 2 are taken into account, as is performance in the training throughout the weekend.
