for|loanwords in the English language|Lists of English words by country or language of origin
A loanword (also loan word or loan-word) is a word adopted from one language (the donor language) and incorporated into another language without translation. This is in contrast to cognates, which are words in two or more languages that are similar because they share an Etymology|etymological origin, and calques, which involve translation.

 Examples and related terms 

A loanword is distinguished from a calque (or loan translation), which is a word or phrase whose Meaning (linguistics)|meaning or idiom is adopted from another language by word-for-word translation into existing words or word-forming roots of the recipient language<ref>https://web.uri.edu/iaics/files/05-Bates-L.-Hoffer.pdf</ref>.

Examples of loanwords in the English language include ''Coffeehouse|café'' (from French ''café'', which literally means "coffee"), bazaar (from Persian ''bāzār'', which means "market"), and kindergarten (from German ''Kindergarten'', which literally means  "children's garden").

In a bit of autological word|heterological irony, the word ''calque'' is an importation from the French noun, derived from the verb ''calquer'' (to trace, to copy);<ref>cite web|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Calque|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: Calque|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|website=ahdictionary.com</ref> the word ''loanword'' is a calque of the German language|German word ''Lehnwort'';<ref>cite book

Strictly speaking, the term ''loanword'' conflicts with the ordinary meaning of ''loan'' in that something is taken from the donor language without it being something that is possible to return.<ref>cite book|

The terms substratum (linguistics)|substrate and superstrate are often used when two languages interact. (However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in second language acquisition or language replacement events, when the native speakers of a certain source language (the substrate) are somehow compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate).<ref>Citation|first = Uriel|last = Weinreich|origyear = 1953|year = 1979|title = Languages in Contact: Findings and Problems|location = New York|publisher = Mouton Publishers|isbn = 978-90-279-2689-0</ref>page needed|date=January 2019

From the arts

Most of the List of musical terms|technical vocabulary of classical music (such as concerto, allegro (music)|allegro, tempo, aria, opera, and soprano) is borrowed from Italian language|Italian,<ref>Shanet 1956: 155.</ref> and that of ballet from French language|French.<ref>Kersley & Sinclair 1979: 3.</ref>

Linguistic classification

The studies by Werner Betz (1949, 1939), Einar Haugen (1950, also 1956), and Uriel Weinreich (1953) are regarded as the classical theoretical works on loan influence.<ref>Compare the two survey articles by Oksaar (1996: 4f.), Stanforth (2002) and Grzega (2003, 2004).</ref> The basic theoretical statements all take Betz's nomenclature as their starting point. Duckworth (1977) enlarges Betz's scheme by the type “partial substitution” and supplements the system with English terms. A schematic illustration of these classifications is given below.<ref>The following comments and examples are taken from Grzega, Joachim (2004), ''Bezeichnungswandel: Wie, Warum, Wozu?'', Heidelberg: Winter, p. 139, and Grzega, Joachim (2003), [http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/SLF/EngluVglSW/grzega1032.pdf “Borrowing as a Word-Finding Process in Cognitive Historical Onomasiology”], ''[http://www.onomasiology.de Onomasiology Online]'' 4: 22&ndash;42.</ref>

The expression "foreign word" used in the illustration below is, however, an incorrect translation of the German term ''Fremdwort'', which refers to loanwords whose pronunciation, spelling, and possible inflection or gender have not yet been so much adapted to the new language that they cease to feel foreign. Such a separation of loanwords into two distinct categories is not used by linguists in English in talking about any language. In addition, basing such a separation mainly on spelling as described in the illustration is (or, in fact, was) not usually done except by German linguists and only when talking about German and sometimes other languages that tend to adapt foreign spellings, which is rare in English unless the word has been in wide use for a very long time.

According to the linguist Suzanne Kemmer, the expression "foreign word" can be defined as follows in English: "[W]hen most speakers do not know the word and if they hear it think it is from another language, the word can be called a foreign word. There are many foreign words and phrases used in English such as bon vivant (French), mutatis mutandis (Latin), and Schadenfreude (German)."<ref>[http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Words/loanwords.html Loanwords] by Prof. S. Kemmer, Rice University</ref> This is however not how the term is (incorrectly) used in this illustration:

File:Loanword classification tree 3.gif|center

On the basis of an importation-substitution distinction, Haugen (1950: 214f.) distinguishes three basic groups of borrowings: “(1) ''Loanwords'' show morphemic importation without substitution.... (2) ''Loanblends'' show morphemic substitution as well as importation.... (3) ''Loanshifts'' show morphemic substitution without importation”. Haugen later refined (1956) his model in a review of Gneuss's (1955) book on Old English loan coinages, whose classification, in turn, is the one by Betz (1949) again.

Weinreich (1953: 47ff.) differentiates between two mechanisms of lexical interference, namely those initiated by simple words and those initiated by compound words and phrases. Weinreich (1953: 47) defines ''simple words'' “from the point of view of the bilinguals who perform the transfer, rather than that of the descriptive linguist. Accordingly, the category ‘simple’ words also includes compounds that are transferred in unanalysed form”. After this general classification, Weinreich then resorts to Betz's (1949) terminology.

 Terms 
Popular loanwords are transmitted orally. 
Learned loanwords are first used in written language, often for scholarly, scientific, or literary purposes.<ref>Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=znFmBZ2D8rEC&pg=PA248&lpg=PA248&dq=&source=bl&ots=GW-MWpUf80&sig=Mz1omR5ym9Re_HSiZ8sQymEn7-Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz3YzyvsjTAhUMC8AKHXLWDn8Q6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&q=%22popular%20and%20learned%20loanwords%22&f=false|title=The Origins and Development of the English Language|last=Algeo|first=John|date=2009-02-02|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1428231455|language=en</ref>

Some English loanwords remain relatively faithful to the donor language's phonology even though a particular phoneme might not exist or have contrastive status in English. For example, the Hawaiian language|Hawaiian word ''Lava#ʻAʻā|okinaaokinaā'' is used by geologists to specify lava that is relatively thick, chunky, and rough. The Hawaiian spelling indicates the two glottal stops in the word, but the English pronunciation, IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|(|ʔ|)|ɑː, contains at most one. In addition, the English spelling usually removes the ʻokina and macron (diacritic)|macron diacritics.<ref>cite book|last1=Elbert|first1=Samuel H.|last2=Pukui|first2=Mary Kawena|title=Hawaiian Dictionary|place=Honolulu|publisher=University of Hawaiʻi Press|year=1986|edition=Revised and enlarged|isbn=0-8248-0703-0|page=389</ref>

The majority of English affixes, such as ''un-'', ''-ing'', and ''-ly'', were present in older forms in Old English. However, a few English affixes are borrowed. For example, the  English verbal suffix -ize|''-ize'' (American English) or ''ise'' (British English) comes from Greek -ιζειν (''-izein'') via Latin ''-izare''.

Languages apart from English

=Transmission in the Ottoman Empire=
During more than 600 years of the Ottoman Empire, the literary and administrative language of the empire was Turkish (language)|Turkish, with many Persian (language)|Persian, and Arabic (language)|Arabic loanwords, called Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish, considerably differing from the everyday spoken Turkish of the time. Many such words were exported to other languages of the empire, such as Albanian language|Albanian, Bosnian language|Bosnian, Bulgarian language|Bulgarian, Croatian language|Croatian, Greek language|Greek, Hungarian language|Hungarian, Ladino language|Ladino, Macedonian language|Macedonian, Montenegrin language|Montenegrin and Serbian language|Serbian. After the empire fell after World War I and the Republic of Turkey was founded, the Turkish language underwent an extensive language reform led by the newly founded Turkish Language Association, during which List of replaced loanwords in Turkish|many adopted words were replaced with new formations derived from Turkic languages|Turkic roots. That was part of the ongoing cultural reform of the time, in turn a part in the broader framework of Atatürk's Reforms, which also included the introduction of the new Turkish alphabet.

Turkish also has taken many words from French (language)|French, such as ''pantolon'' for ''trousers'' (from French ''pantalon'') and ''komik'' for ''funny'' (from French ''comique''), most of them pronounced very similarly. Word usage in modern Turkey has acquired a political tinge: right-wing publications tend to use more Arabic or Persian originated words, left-wing ones use more adopted from European languages, while centrist ones use more native Turkish root words.<ref>cite book|last=Lewis|first=Geoffrey|title=The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success|place=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-925669-1</ref>

=Dutch words in Indonesian=
Almost 350 years of Dutch presence in what is now Indonesia have left significant linguistic traces. Though very few Indonesians have a fluent knowledge of Dutch, the Indonesian language inherited many words from Dutch, both in words for everyday life and as well in scientific or technological terminology.<ref>Sneddon (2003), p.162.</ref> One scholar argues that 20% of Indonesian language|Indonesian words can be traced back to Dutch words.<ref>cite web|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/ies/050208/ |title=A Hidden Language – Dutch in Indonesia [eScholarship&#93; |publisher=Repositories.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-29</ref>

=Romance Languages=
A large percentage of the lexicon of Romance languages, themselves descended from Vulgar Latin, consists of loanwords (later learned or scholarly borrowings) from Latin. These words can be distinguished by lack of typical sound changes and other transformations found in descended words, or by meanings taken directly from Classical Latin|Classical or Ecclesiastical Latin that did not evolve or change over time as expected; in addition, there are also semi-learned terms which were adapted partially to the Romance language's character. Latin borrowings can be known by several names in Romance languages: in Spanish, for example, they are usually referred to as "cultismos",<ref>http://aliso.pntic.mec.es/agalle17/latin/verba/definiciones.pdf</ref><ref>cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FtxywY_6g4UC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=semi+cultismos&source=bl&ots=roJj7t4YpC&sig=z1LCniOlEaGfTOSzsVMwOXayKnM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjL0P2XlujdAhWHTd8KHUgNBMgQ6AEwCnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=semi+cultismos&f=false|title=The Romance Languages|first=Rebecca|last=Posner|date=5 September 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books</ref> and in Italian as "latinismi".

Latin is usually the most common source of loanwords in these languages, such as in Italian, Spanish, French, etc.,<ref name="cscanada.net">cscanada.net/index.php/sll/article/download/9579/10252</ref><ref>cite journal|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00437956.1968.11435535|title=On the Genealogical Structure of the Spanish Vocabulary|first=William T.|last=Patterson|date=1 January 1968|publisher=|journal=''WORD''|volume=24|issue=1-3|pages=309–339|doi=10.1080/00437956.1968.11435535</ref><ref name="ulaval.ca">cite web|url=http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/francophonie/HIST_FR_s92_Emprunts.htm#3._Lapport_des_langues_anciennes_au_fran%C3%A7ais_|title=Chjapitre 10: Histoire du français - Les emprunts et la langue française|website=www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca</ref> and in some cases the total number of loans may even outnumber inherited terms<ref>cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/|title=Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales|website=www.cnrtl.fr</ref><ref>https://www.scribd.com/document/157203089/Diccionario-Critico-Etimologico-castellano-A-CA-Corominas-Joan-pdf</ref> (although the learned borrowings are less often used in common speech, with the most common vocabulary being of inherited, orally transmitted origin from Vulgar Latin). This has led to many cases of etymological Doublet (linguistics)|doublets in these languages.

For most Romance languages, these loans were initiated by scholars, clergy, or other learned people and occurred in Medieval times, peaking in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance era<ref name="ulaval.ca"/>- in Italian, the 14th century had the highest number of loans.<ref name="cscanada.net"/> In the case of Romanian, the language underwent a "re-Latinization" process later than the others (see Romanian lexis, section link|Romanian language|French, Italian, and English loanwords), in the 18th and 19th centuries, partially using French and Italian words (many of these themselves being earlier borrowings from Latin) as intermediaries,<ref>cite web|url=http://www.dex.ro/|title=dex.ro - Dicţionarul explicativ al limbii române|website=www.dex.ro</ref> in an effort to modernize the language, often adding concepts that did not exist until then, or replacing words of other origins. These common borrowings and features also essentially serve to raise mutual intelligibility of the Romance languages, particularly in academic/scholarly, literary, technical, and scientific domains. Many of these same words are also found in English (through its numerous borrowings from Latin and French) and other European languages.

In addition to Latin loanwords, many words of Ancient Greek origin were also borrowed into Romance languages, often in part through scholarly Latin intermediates, and these also often pertained to academic, scientific, literary, and technical topics. Furthermore, to a lesser extent, Romance languages borrowed from a variety of other languages; in particular English has become an important source in more recent times. Study of the origin of these words and their function and context within the language can illuminate some important aspects and characteristics of the language, and can reveal insights on the general phenomenon of lexical borrowing in linguistics as a method of enriching a language.<ref>https://www.e-periodica.ch/cntmng?pid=rlr-001:1969:33::530</ref>

Cultural aspects
According to Hans Henrich Hock and Brian Joseph, "languages and dialects ... do not exist in a vacuum": there is always linguistic contact between groups.<ref>cite book

Changes in meaning and pronunciation

In some cases, the original meaning shifts considerably through unexpected logical leaps.  The English word ''Viking'' became Japanese バイキング ''baikingu'' meaning 'buffet', because Imperial Viking was the first restaurant in Japan to offer buffet-style meals.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20050524aj.html]  dead link|date=June 2016|bot=mediccbignore|bot=medic</ref>
