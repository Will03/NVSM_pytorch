Toki Pona is an Oligoisolating language|oligoisolating constructed language, created by Canadian linguist and translator Sonja Lang<ref name=":0">Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/canadian-has-people-talking-about-lingo-she-created/article20399052/|title=Canadian has people talking about lingo she created|last=Roberts|first=Siobhan|date=2007-07-09|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-ca</ref><ref name="latimes" /> as a philosophical language for the purpose of simplifying thoughts and communication.<ref name="latimes" /><ref>Cite web|url=https://medium.com/snipette/the-littlest-language-11bb2301dcfc|title=The Littlest Language|last=Sunderarajan|first=Badri|date=2017-12-17|website=Snipette|access-date=2019-01-11</ref> It was first published online in 2001 as a draft,<ref name=":14">Cite web|url=https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2018/03/27/toki-pona-invented-language-120-words/|title=Exploring Toki Pona: do we need more than 120 words?|last=Thomas|first=Simon|date=2018-03-27|website=Oxford Dictionaries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-02-03</ref> then in its complete form in the book ''Toki Pona: The Language of Good'' in 2014.

Much of the activity takes place online in chat rooms, on social media, and in other groups, although there have been a few organized group meetings in person over the past couple of years.

One of Toki Pona’s main goals is a focus on minimalism. Like a pidgin, it focuses on simple concepts and elements that are universal among cultures. Lang designed Toki Pona to express maximal meaning with minimal complexity. The language has 120–125 root words and 14 phonemes designed to be easy to pronounce for speakers of various linguist backgrounds. Although it was not intended as an international auxiliary language,<ref>Cite book|title=The Routledge Linguistics Encyclopedia|last=Malmkjær|first=Kirsten|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9780415424325|edition=3rd|location=New York|pages=34|chapter=Artificial languages|oclc=656296619</ref> it may as well function as one.<ref>Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516233127/http://www.langmaker.com/db/Toki_Pona|title=Toki Pona|last=|first=|date=|website=Langmaker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-13</ref> Inspired by Taoist philosophy, the language is designed to help users focus on the essentials and remove complexity from the thought process.<ref name=":10">Cite web|url=http://tpnimi.blogspot.com/2011/03/introduction-draft.html|title=Introduction (draft)|last=Clifford|first=John|date=2011-03-22|website=nimi pi toki pona|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-25</ref><ref>cite web|url=http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/whytokipona.php|title="Why Toki Pona?"|last=Lang|first=Sonja|date=|website=lipu pi jan Pije|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-20|quote="Toki Pona follows the principles of Taoism, which advocates a simple, honest life and noninterference with the course of natural events."</ref><ref name=":8">Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/toki-pona-smallest-language/398363/|title=How to Say Everything in a Hundred-Word Language|last=Morin|first=Roc|date=2015-07-05|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2019-01-07</ref><ref name=":9">Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Made-Up Languages|last=Rogers|first=Steven D.|publisher=Adams Media|year=2011|isbn=978-1440528170|location=United States of America|pages=|chapter=Part I: Made-Up Langauges – Toki pona</ref> Despite the small vocabulary, speakers are able to understand and communicate with each other, mainly relying on context and combinations of several words to express more specific meanings.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":6" />

Etymology
The name of the language is compounded with ''toki'' (language), derived from Tok Pisin lang|tpi|tok, which itself comes from English ''talk''; and ''pona'' (good/simple), from Esperanto lang|eo|bona (good),<ref name=":3">Cite web|url=http://ucteam.ru/toki-pona/|title=Toki Pona Word Origins|last=|first=|date=|website=UC Team|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-12</ref> ultimately from Latin lang|la|bonus.<ref>Cite web|url=https://plume.mastodon.host/~/TokiPonaAConlangAndItsSpeakers/toki-pona-root-word-etymology-page?fbclid=IwAR1Foenu63NnjlGgtZ3JW-qnyBuS8unQkxsr5jPYhzD-6bCzeSUeh8ofCXE|title=Toki Pona Root Word Etymology Page|last=jansegers|first=|date=2018-09-17|website=Plume – Toki Pona : a conlang and its speakers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-02-03</ref><ref>Cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bona|title=bona – Esperanto|last=|first=|date=2018-12-12|website=Wiktionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-25</ref>

History
Sonja Lang published an early version of the language online in 2001 as a coping mechanism during her depression.<ref name=":0" />

As the community grew, a group of speakers, along with Sonja Lang, formed a Yahoo! Groups|Yahoo! group on March 24, 2002 which they used until 2009 when it was moved to a forum on a phpBB site.<ref>Cite web|url=http://forums.tokipona.org/viewforum.php?f=33|title=toki pini pi kulupu Jaku - Toki Pona Forums|website=forums.tokipona.org|access-date=2019-01-11</ref>

From 2002 to 2009, members of the group discussed the language with one another in English, Toki Pona, and Esperanto, proposed changes, and talked about the resources on the tokipona.org site. At its peak member count, the group had a little over 500 members.<ref>Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430061813/http://groups.yahoo.com:80/group/tokipona/|title=tokipona : Toki Pona|date=2013-04-30|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-01-11</ref>

A Wikipedia (called “Wikipesija” in the language) written in Toki Pona existed for a few months but was closed in 2004 and moved to Wikia.<ref>Cite web|url=http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=814&hilit=wikicities|title=Wikipedia|last=|first=|date=2007|website=Toki Pona Forums|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-15</ref><ref>Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041122013238/http://tokipona.wikipedia.org:80/wiki/lipu_lawa|title=lipu lawa|last=|first=|date=2004-11-22|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-12</ref><ref>Cite web|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias#Deprecated,_moved_and_other|title=List of Wikipedias – Deprecated, moved and other – Moved and deleted|last=|first=|date=2018-12-25|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-15</ref>

As speakers used Toki Pona in chat groups during the earlier years, it began to change, and Lang worked with the community to gradually improve and polish the language. For this reason, a member of the community, Bryant J. Knight or “jan Pije”, began developing his Toki Pona website around 2002. Many members of the community use it as a resource for teaching and learning the language. Knight created his own lessons and published them on his site to reflect the changes in the language that had occurred, and he continued to update them until the most recent update in 2017.<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/|title=lipu pi jan Pije|website=tokipona.net|access-date=2019-01-11</ref>
File:Toki Pona The Language of Good.jpg|thumb|286x286px|Cover of ''Toki Pona: The Language of Good'' (2014)
Lang began writing the official book, ''Toki Pona: The Language of Good'', along with help from a few members from the community, and published it a few years later in 2014. The official book coined a new word ''pu'' which means “interacting with the Toki Pona book.” The book demonstrates the way Lang uses the language, and it helped to anchor some of the ideas about the grammar of Toki Pona and how it functions.<ref name=":1">Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/921253340|title=Toki Pona: The Language of Good|last=Lang|first=Sonja|publisher=Tawhid|year=2014|isbn=9780978292300|edition=|pages=|oclc=921253340</ref>

Since the publication of the book, the amount of speakers and learners of Toki Pona has increased dramatically. The community continues to thrive and interact with each other on various sites and apps on the internet.

In 2007 and 2017 the members of the community applied for an ISO 639-3 code, which was rejected in both cases. The reason for the latter one being that the language "does not appear to be used in a variety of domains nor for communication within a community which includes all ages."<ref>Cite web|url=https://iso639-3.sil.org/request/2017-035|title=Change Request Documentation: 2017-035|last=|first=|date=|website=SIL ISO 639-3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-10</ref> As of today, a page on Wikia has been dedicated to collecting various references about Toki Pona so that the next application could be successful.<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.wikia.com/wiki/ISO|title=ISO|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipesija|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-10</ref>

Toki Pona was chosen for the first version of the vocabulary for the Robot Interaction Language|ROILA project in 2010. The purpose of this project was to study the use of an artificial language on the accuracy of machine speech recognition and it was revealed that the modified vocabulary of Toki Pona significantly outperformed English whereas it was not that successful while evaluating the grammar.<ref>Cite journal|last=Mubin|first=Omar|last2=Bartneck|first2=Christoph|last3=Feijs|first3=Loe|date=2010|title=Towards the Design and Evaluation of ROILA: A Speech Recognition Friendly Artificial Language|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221418730_Towards_the_Design_and_Evaluation_of_ROILA_A_Speech_Recognition_Friendly_Artificial_Language|journal=Advances in Natural Language Processing|publisher=|volume=LNCS 6233/2010|pages=250–256|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-14770-8_28|via=ResearchGate</ref> It has also been used in other studies on language learning.<ref>Cite journal|last=Saerbeck|first=Martin|last2=Schut|first2=Tom|last3=Bartneck|first3=Christoph|last4=Janse|first4=Maddy D.|date=2010|title=Expressive Robots in Education Varying the Degree of Social Supportive Behavior of a Robotic Tutor|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221517442_Expressive_Robots_in_Education_Varying_the_Degree_of_Social_Supportive_Behavior_of_a_Robotic_Tutor|journal=Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, CHI 2010|volume=|pages=1613–1622|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753567|via=ResearchGate</ref><ref>Cite journal|last=Mubin|first=Omar|last2=Shahid|first2=Suleman|last3=Bartneck|first3=Christoph|last4=Krahmer|first4=Emiel|last5=Swerts|first5=Marc|last6=Feijs|first6=Loe|date=2009|title=Using Language Tests and Emotional Expressions to Determine the Learnability of Artificial Languages|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200508137_Using_Language_Tests_and_Emotional_Expressions_to_Determine_the_Learnability_of_Artificial_Languages|journal=CHI '09 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1145/1520340.1520620|via=ResearchGate</ref><ref>Cite journal|last=Mubin|first=Omar|last2=Bartneck|first2=Christopher|last3=Feijs|first3=Loe|date=2009|title=What you say is not what you get: Arguing for Artificial Languages Instead of Natural Languages in Human Robot Speech Interaction|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200508138_What_you_say_is_not_what_you_get_Arguing_for_Artificial_Languages_Instead_of_Natural_Languages_in_Human_Robot_Speech_Interaction|journal=Spoken Dialogue and Human-Robot Interaction Workshop at IEEE RoMan 2009, Toyama|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.35509.68325|via=ResearchGate</ref><ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.wikia.com/wiki/ISO|title=ISO – Academia|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipesija|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-02-03</ref>

Phonology and phonotactics

=Inventory=
Toki Pona has nine consonants (IPA|/p, t, k, s, m, n, l, j, w/) and five vowels (IPA|/a, e, i, o, u/). The first syllable of a word is stressed. There are no diphthongs, contrasting pair|contrasting vowel length, consonant clusters, or tone (linguistics)|tones.<ref name=":6">Cite journal|last=Blahuš|first=Marek|date=November 2011|editor-last=Fiedler|editor-first=Sabine|title=Toki Pona: eine minimalistische Plansprache|trans-title=Toki Pona: A Minimalistic Planned Language|url=http://www.interlinguistik-gil.de/wb/media/beihefte/18/beiheft18.pdf#page=51|journal=Interlinguistische Informationen|language=German|publication-place=Berlin|volume=18|pages=51–55|issn=1432-3567|via=</ref>

=Distribution=
The statistical vowel spread is fairly typical when compared with other languages. Counting each root once, 32% of vowels are IPA|/a/, 25% are IPA|/i/, with IPA|/e/ and IPA|/o/ a bit over 15% each, and 10% are IPA|/u/. 20% of roots are vowel initial. The usage frequency in a 10kB sample of texts was slightly more skewed: 34% IPA|/a/, 30% IPA|/i/, 15% each IPA|/e/ and IPA|/o/, and 6% IPA|/u/.<ref>Cite web|url=http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/i/jimhenry1973/conlang/tokipona/tokipona.htm|title=Phoneme frequency table / Ofteco de fonemoj|last=|first=|date=|website=lipu pi toki pona pi jan Jakopo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114085856/http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/i/jimhenry1973/conlang/tokipona/tokipona.htm|archive-date=2007-11-14|dead-url=|access-date=</ref>

Of the syllable-initial consonants, IPA|/l/ is the most common, at 20% total; IPA|/k, s, p/ are over 10%, then the nasals IPA|/m, n/ (not counting final N), with the least common, at little more than 5% each, being IPA|/t, w, j/.

The high frequency of IPA|/l/ and low frequency of IPA|/t/ is somewhat unusual among the world's languages.<ref name=":6" /> The fact that IPA|/l/ occurs in the grammatical particles ''la, li, ala'' suggests that its percentage would be even higher in texts; the text-based stats cited above did not specifically consider initial consonants, but indicate that IPA|/l/ was about 25%, while IPA|/t/ doubled its frequency to just over 10% (IPA|/k/, IPA|/t/, IPA|/m/, IPA|/s/, IPA|/p/, respectively, ranged over 12% to 9% each, with IPA|/n/ unknown, and the semivowels IPA|/j/ and IPA|/w/ again coming in last at 7% each).

=Syllable structure=
All syllables are of the form (C)V(N), i.e. optional consonant + vowel + optional final nasal, or V, CV, VN, CVN. As in most languages, CV is the most common syllable type, at 75% (counting each root once). V and CVN syllables are each around 10%, while only 5 words have VN syllables (for 2% of syllables).<ref name=":6" /> In both the dictionary and in texts, the ratio of consonants to vowels is almost exactly one-to-one.

Most roots (70%) are disyllabic; about 20% are monosyllables and 10% trisyllables. This is a common distribution, and similar to Polynesian.<ref name=":6" />

=Phonotactics=
The following sequences are not allowed: *IPA|/ji, wu, wo, ti/, nor may a syllable's final nasal occur before IPA|/m/ or IPA|/n/ in the same root.<ref name=":6" /> Syllables that aren't word-initial must have an initial consonant, though in roots like ''ijo'' (from Esperanto ''io)'' and ''suwi'' (ultimately from English ''sweet),'' that might be considered an orthographic convention, with the effect that glottal stop only marks word boundaries. (The sequences IPA|/ij/ and IPA|/uw/ are no more easily distinguished from simple IPA|/i/ and IPA|/u/ than the banned *IPA|/ji/ and *IPA|/wu/ are.)

Proper nouns are usually converted into Toki Pona proper adjectives using a set of guidelines.<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona9.php|title=o kama sona e toki pona! Lesson 9: Gender, Unofficial Words, Commands|last=Knight|first=Bryant|date=2017-08-31|website=lipu pi jan Pije|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-25</ref> The native, or even colloquial, pronunciation is used as the basis for the subsequent sound conversion. Thus, England or English become ''Inli'' and John becomes ''San''.<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/tpize.php|title=Phonetic conversion of proper names|last=Knight|first=Bryant|date=|website=lipu pi jan Pije|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-15</ref>

=Allophony=
The nasal at the end of a syllable can be pronounced as any nasal stop, though it is normally assimilated to the following consonant. That is, it typically occurs as an IPA|[n] before IPA|/n/, IPA|/t/, IPA|/s/ or IPA|/l/, as an IPA|[m] before IPA|/m/, IPA|/p/ or IPA|/w/, as an IPA|[ŋ] before IPA|/k/, and as an IPA|[ɲ] before IPA|/j/.<ref name=":6" />

Because of its small phoneme inventory, Toki Pona allows for quite a lot of allophonic variation. For example, IPA|/p t k/ may be pronounced IPA|[b d ɡ] as well as IPA|[p t k], IPA|/s/ as IPA|[z] or IPA|[ʃ] as well as IPA|[s], IPA|/l/ as IPA|[ɾ] as well as IPA|[l], and vowels may be either long or short.<ref name=":6" /> Both its sound inventory and phonotactics (patterns of possible sound combinations) are found in the majority of human languages and are therefore readily accessible. For example, *IPA|/ji, wu, wo/ are also impossible in Korean and other languages, which is convenient when writing Toki Pona in alternative scripts.

Writing systems
14 Latin alphabet|Latin letters, ''a e i j k l m n o p s t u w'', are used to write the language. They have the same values as in the International Phonetic Alphabet:<ref>Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Updated_jan_Pije's_lessons/Lesson_2_Pronunciation|title=Updated jan Pije's lessons/Lesson 2 Pronunciation - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikibooks|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-05</ref> ''j'' sounds like English ''y,'' and the vowels are like those of Spanish phonology|Spanish or Italian phonology|Italian. Capital initials are used to mark Proper noun|proper adjectives, while Toki Pona roots are always written with lowercase letters, even when they start a sentence.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/tokipona.htm|title=Toki Pona|last=|first=|date=|website=Omniglot: the online encyclopedia of writing systems & languages|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-13</ref>

File:Toki Pona sitelen pona examples.png|thumb|Modified symbols in ''sitelen pona''
Two Logogram|logographic writing systems, ''sitelen pona'' and ''sitelen sitelen'', were later introduced and included in ''Toki Pona: The Language of Good''. The former, in which each word is represented by a symbol, was devised by Lang herself. Proper names are written inside a cartouche-like symbol using a series of symbols, where each symbol represents the first letter of its word. Symbols representing a single adjective may be written inside or above the symbol for the preceding word that they modify.<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/hieroglyphs.php|title=Toki Pona Hieroglyphs|last=Knight|first=Bryant|date=2017-08-31|website=lipu pi jan Pije|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-07</ref> The symbol of the language is written in ''sitelen pona,'' with the symbol for ''pona'' written inside the symbol for ''toki''.

File:Sitelen sitelen.png|thumb|The word symbols of ''sitelen sitelen''
The latter system, ''sitelen sitelen'', was created by Jonathan Gabel. It is more elaborate and visually resembles the Maya script|Mayan script. This non-linear logographic system uses two separate methods to form words: images representing whole words, and images that represent syllables, composed of graphemes representing each phoneme.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/sitelen.htm|title=Sitelen|last=|first=|date=|website=Omniglot: the online encyclopedia of writing systems & languages|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-11</ref>

In addition, the community has adapted other scripts to write Toki Pona, such as Korean Hangul, the Arabic script, and J. R. R. Tolkien's Tengwar.<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.wikia.com/wiki/ISO|title=ISO – Writing systems|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipesija|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-13</ref><ref name=":6" />

Grammar
Toki Pona’s word order is Subject–verb–object|Subject-Verb-Object.<ref name=":12">Cite web|url=https://conlang.org/language-creation-conference/lcc6/lcc6-relay/3-toki-pona-text/|title=3. Toki Pona Text – Grammar and Vocabulary|last=|first=|date=|website=Language Creation Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-25</ref> The word ''li'' introduces predicates, ''e'' introduces direct objects, prepositional phrases follow the objects, and ''la'' phrases come before the subject to add additional context.<ref name=":11" />

Some roots are particles for grammatical functions, while others have Lexical semantics|lexical meanings. The lexical roots do not fall into well defined part of speech|parts of speech; rather, they may generally be used as nouns, verbs, modifiers, or interjections depending on context or their position in a phrase.<ref>Cite web|url=http://tpnimi.blogspot.com/2010/09/parts-of-speech.html|title=Parts of speech|last=Clifford|first=John|date=2010-09-04|website=nimi pi toki pona|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-25</ref> For example, ''ona li moku'' may mean "they ate" or "it is food".<ref name=":6" />

= Sentence structures =
A sentence may be an interjection, statement, wish/command, or question.

Some interjections are ''a'', ''ala'', ''ike'', ''jaki'', ''mu'', ''o'', ''pakala'', ''pona'', ''toki'', etc. and can stand alone as a sentence.<ref name=":11" />

Statements follow the normal structure of ''subject predicate'' with an optional ''la'' phrase at the beginning. The word ''li'' always comes before the predicate unless the subject is ''mi'' or ''sina'' by itself. The direct object marker ''e'' comes before the direct objects.<ref name=":12" /> More ''li'' and ''e'' markers can introduce new predicates or direct objects.<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona4.php|title=o kama sona e toki pona! Lesson 4: Direct Objects; Compound Sentences|last=|first=|date=2017-08-31|website=lipu pi jan Pije|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-25</ref> Vocative case|Vocative phrases come before the main sentence and are marked with ''o'' at the end of the phase, after the addressee.<ref name=":11" />

In commands, the word ''o'' comes before a verb to express a second person command. It can also replace ''li'', or come after the subjects ''mi'' or ''sina'', to express wishes.<ref name=":11" />

There are two ways to form Yes–no question|yes-no questions in Toki Pona. The first method is to use the “verb ala verb” construction in which ala comes in between a duplicated verb, auxiliary verb, or other Predicate (grammar)|predicator. Another way to form a yes-no question is to put “anu seme?” (lit. or what?) at the end of a sentence. It is important to note that questions cannot be made by just putting a question mark at the end of a sentence.<ref name=":13" />

Non-polar questions are formed by substituting the unknown information with the interrogative word ''seme''.<ref name=":13">Cite web|url=http://tpnimi.blogspot.com/2016/03/tp-faq-6-how-do-you-make-question-in-tp.html|title=tp FAQ 6 How do you make a question in tp?|last=Clifford|first=John|date=2016-03-18|website=nimi pi toki pona|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-25</ref>

=Pronouns=
Toki Pona has basic pronouns: ''mi'' (first person), ''sina'' (second person), and ''ona'' (third person).<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.suburbandestiny.com/?p=239|title=Toki Pona: Pronouns unleashed|last=Martin|first=Matthew|date=2007-09-11|website=My Suburban Destiny|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-25</ref>

The pronouns do not specify number or gender. Therefore, ''ona'' can mean "he", "she", "it", or "they". In practice, Toki Pona speakers use the phrase ''mi mute'' to mean "we", though the number is often discernible from context and thus only ''mi'' is necessary. Likewise, ''ona mute'' may mean "they" and ''sina mute'' would mean "you" (plural).<ref name=":11" />

Whenever the subject of a sentence is either of the unmodified pronouns ''mi'' or ''sina'', then ''li'' is not used to separate the subject and predicate.<ref name=":11">Cite web|url=https://jan-lope.github.io/Toki_Pona_lessons_English/|title=Toki Pona - Lessons and Dictionary|last=Warnke|first=Robert|date=|website=jan Lope github|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-25</ref>

=Nouns=
With such a small root-word vocabulary, Toki Pona relies heavily on compound nouns, where a noun is modified by a following root, to make more complex meanings.<ref name="latimes">cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-conlang24aug24,0,4155484,full.story|title=In their own words – literally / Babel's modern architects|last=Dance|first=Amber|date=2007-08-24|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2007-08-29|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103134152/http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-conlang24aug24,0,4155484,full.story|archivedate=January 3, 2013|deadurl=yes|publisher=|df=</ref> A typical example is combining ''jan'' (person) with ''utala'' (fight) to make ''jan utala'' (soldier, warrior).<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona5.php|title=o kama sona e toki pona! Lesson 5: Adjectives, Adverbs|last=Knight|first=Bryant|date=2017-08-31|website=lipu pi jan Pije|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-26</ref> [See 'modifiers' next.]

Nouns do not decline according to number.<ref name=":11" /> ''jan'' can mean "person", "people",<ref name=":11" /> or "the human race" depending on context.

Toki Pona does not use isolated proper nouns; instead, they must modify a preceding noun. For this reason they are called "proper adjectives"; they are functionally the same as compound nouns.<ref name="Yerrick">cite web|url=http://www.pineight.com/tokipona/tpreview.html|title=Toki Pona li pona ala pona? A review of Sonja Kisa's constructed language Toki Pona|last=Yerrick|first=Damian|date=2002-10-23|website=Pin Eight|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-07-20</ref> For example, names of people and places are used as modifiers of the common roots for "person" and "place", e.g. ''ma Kanata'' (lit. "Canada country") or ''jan Lisa'' (lit. "Lisa person").<ref name=":6" />

=Modifiers=
Phrases in Toki Pona are head-initial; modifiers always come after the word that they modify.<ref>Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203111715/http://www.encyclopedian.com/to/Toki-Pona-language.html|title=Toki Pona language – Syntax|last=|first=|date=2008-12-03|website=Encyclopedian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-26</ref> This trait resembles the typical arrangement of adjectives in Spanish grammar|Spanish and Arabic grammar|Arabic and contrasts with the typical English structure. Therefore ''kasi kule'', literally "plant of colour", always refers to a plant that is colourful. ''kasi kule poki'', literally "plant of colour of container" refers to a colourful plant that comes in a container, i.e. a potted flower.

In the other direction, the English expression "plant pot" refers to a container, so it must be rendered into Toki Pona with the word meaning "container" at the beginning, i.e. ''poki kasi'' (lit. "pot of plant"). A "flower pot" would be ''poki pi kasi kule'' (literally "pot of plant colour").

In Toki Pona, "N A1 A2" (where N represents a noun and A1 and A2 represent modifiers) is always understood as ((N A1) A2), i.e. an A1 N that is A2: E.g., ''jan pona lukin'' = ((jan pona) lukin), a friend watching, rather than (jan (pona lukin)), a good-looking person.<ref name=":6" />

This can be changed with the particle ''pi'', "of", which groups the following adjectives into a kind of compound adjective that applies to the head noun, which leads to ''jan pi pona lukin'' = (jan (pona lukin)), "good-looking person." Demonstratives, numerals, and possessive pronouns follow other modifiers.<ref name=":6" />

=Verbs=
Toki Pona does not inflect verbs according to person, tense, mood, or voice, as the language features no inflection whatsoever. Person is inferred from the subject of the verb; time is inferred from context or a temporal adverb in the sentence as a subclause.<ref name=":11" /> The closest thing to passivity in Toki Pona is a structure such as "(result) of (subject) is because of (agent)." Alternatively, one could phrase a passive sentence as an active one with the agent subject being unknown.

Prepositions can be used as a kind of verb. For example, ''tawa'' means "to" as a preposition and "to go", "to move" or "to go to" as a verb; ''lon'' means "in" or "at" as a preposition and "to be in/at" or "to exist" or "to be true" as a verb; ''kepeken'' means "using" or "with" (in the sense of the instrumental case) as a preposition and "to use" as a verb. Verbs from prepositional roots have their objects right after them without the direct object marker ''e'', similar to when they are used as a preposition.<ref name=":11" /> Compare ''mi moku lon tomo mi'' for "I am eating ''at my house''" and ''mi lon tomo mi'' for "I ''am at my house''." Using the direct object marker ''e'' with a prepositional verb makes it causative, e.g. ''mi tawa e sijelo mi'' means "I make my body move". An exception is often made for ''kepeken'', which some speakers use with ''e'' without a causative sense. E.g. both ''mi kepeken ilo'' and ''mi kepeken e ilo'' are used to say "I am using a tool."

Vocabulary
File:Toki pona sitelen pona.png|alt=|thumb|435x435px|A list of vocabulary along with their symbols in the ''sitelen pona'' script
The vocabulary is designed around the principles of living a simple life without the complications of modern civilization and heavily relies on context<ref name=":10" /> and metaphor.<ref name=":14" /> Toki Pona is generally said to have around 120,<ref name=":5">Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/08/toki-pona-invented-language-memrise|title=What happened when I tried to learn Toki Pona in 48 hours using memes|last=Bramley|first=Ellie Violet|date=2015-01-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-07</ref> 123,<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio-web/podcast-of-the-week-the-smallest-language-in-the-world-1.3597426|title=Podcast of the week: The smallest language in the world|last=Griffin|first=Sarah|date=2018-08-18|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2019-01-07</ref> or 125<ref>Cite journal|last=Zorrilla|first=Natalia C.|date=2018|title=Still Hoping: The Relation of International Auxiliary Languages to Worldview and Perception|url=https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sj24a/|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.31235/osf.io/sj24a|via=SocArXiv</ref> root words,<ref>Originally 118 roots, with several roots added later.</ref> which have numerous denotations, so ''suli'' not only means "big" or "long", but also "important".<ref name=":6" /> To express more concepts, the roots can be combined. For example, ''jan pona'' can mean friend, although it literally translates as "good person", and ''telo nasa'', which literally means "strange water" or "liquid of craziness", would be understood to mean "alcohol" or "alcoholic beverage" depending on the context.<ref name=":11" /> The verb "to teach" can be expressed by ''pana e sona'', which literally means "to give knowledge".<ref name="Kozlovsky">cite journal|author=Козловский|first=Станислав (Stanislav Kozlovsky)|date=2004-07-20|title=Скорость мысли (The Speed of Thought)|url=https://old.computerra.ru/2004/550/205383/|journal=Компьютерра (Computerra)|language=Russian|publisher=|volume=|pages=|accessdate=2007-07-20|via=</ref> Essentially identical concepts can be described by different words as the choice relies on the speaker's perception and experience.<ref name=":14" /> 

=Colours=
Toki Pona has five root words for colours: ''pimeja'' (black), ''walo'' (white), ''loje'' (red), ''jelo'' (yellow), and ''laso'' (blue).<ref name=":8" /> Each word represents multiple shades: ''laso'' refers to colours as light as cornflower blue or as dark as navy blue, and includes tints of both green, blue, and cyan.
File:Color mixture.svg|alt=|left|thumb|167x167px|Many colours can be expressed by using subtractive colours
Although the simplified conceptualization of colours tends to exclude a number of colours that are commonly expressed in Western languages, speakers sometimes may combine these five words to make more specific descriptions of certain colours. For instance, "purple" may be represented by combining ''laso'' and ''loje''. The phrase ''laso loje'' means "a reddish shade of blue" and ''loje laso'' means "a bluish shade of red".<ref name=":6" />

=Numbers=
Toki Pona has root words for one (''wan''), two (''tu''), and many (''mute''). In addition, ''ala'' can mean zero, although its more literal meaning is "no" or "none," and ''ale'' "all" can express an infinite or immense amount.<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/dictionary.php|title=Toki Pona dictionary|last=Knight|first=Bryant|date=|website=lipu pi jan Pije|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-13</ref>

The simplest number system uses these five roots to express any amount necessary. For numbers larger than two, speakers would use ''mute'' which means "many".<ref name=":11" />

A more complex system expresses larger numbers additively by using phrases such as ''tu wan'' for three, ''tu tu'' for four, and so on. This feature purposely makes it impractical to communicate large numbers.<ref name="Yerrick" />

An alternate system proposed by Lang's official 2014 description of Toki Pona for larger numbers uses ''luka'' (literally "hand") to signify "five", ''mute'' (literally "many") to signify "twenty" and ''ale'' (literally "all") to signify "100". For example, using this structure ''ale tu'' would mean "102" and ''mute mute mute luka luka luka tu wan'' would signify "78".<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.net/tp/Numbers.aspx|title=Numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=tokipona.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-26</ref>

=Roots history=
File:BodyTokiPona.jpg|thumb|right|Body parts in Toki Pona
Some words have obsolete synonyms. For example, ''nena'' replaced ''kapa'' (protuberance) early in the language's development for unknown reasons. Later, the pronoun ''ona'' replaced ''iki'' (he, she, it, they), which was sometimes confused with ''ike'' (bad).<ref name="Yerrick" />

Similarly, ''ali'' was added as an alternative to ''ale'' (all) to avoid confusion with ''ala'' (no, not) among people who vowel reduction|reduce unstressed vowels, though both forms are still used.<ref>Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Updated_jan_Pije%27s_lessons/Lesson_8_Negation,_Yes_-_No_Questions|title=Updated jan Pije's lessons/Lesson 8 Negation, Yes - No Questions|last=Knight|first=Bryant|date=2011-12-27|website=Wikibooks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-25</ref>

Originally, ''oko'' meant "eye" and ''lukin'' was used as a verb "see". The meanings were later merged into ''lukin'', ''oko'' being the alternative''.'' Most users, however, tend to follow the traditional definitions.<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona15.php|title=o kama sona e toki pona! Lesson 15: The Body|last=|first=|date=|website=lipu pi jan Pije|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-13</ref>

Words that have been simply removed from the lexicon include ''leko'' (block, stairs), ''monsuta'' (monster, fear), ''majuna'' (old), and ''pata'' (sibling).<ref>Cite web|url=http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/extinctwords.php|title=Extinct words|last=Knight|first=Bryant|date=2017-08-31|website=lipu pi jan Pije|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-13</ref>

Besides ''nena'' and ''ona,'' which replaced existing roots, a few roots were added to the original 118: ''pan'' (grain, bread, pasta, rice), ''esun'' (market, shop, trade), ''alasa'', (hunt, gather), ''kipisi'', (to cut), and ''namako'' (extra, additional, spice), another word for ''sin'' (new).<ref>cite web|url=http://www.tokipona.net/tp/ClassicWordList.aspx|title=Classic Word List (Improved!)|last=|first=|date=|website=tokipona.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-07</ref>

''kipisi'' is now considered outdated because it was not included in the official book, although some speakers still use the word.

=Provenance=
File:Toki Pona etymologies.png|thumb|Origin of the Toki Pona roots by language. Obsolete roots are not included|333x333px

Toki Pona roots generally come from English language|English, Tok Pisin, Finnish language|Finnish, Georgian language|Georgian, Dutch language|Dutch, Acadian French, Esperanto, Croatian language|Croatian, and Chinese language|Chinese (Standard Chinese|Mandarin and Cantonese).<ref name=":3" />

Many of these derivations are transparent. For example, ''oko'' (eye) is identical to Slavic ''oko'' and similar to other cognates such as Spanish language|Spanish ''ojo'', Italian language|Italian ''occhio'' and English ''ocular''; likewise, ''toki'' (speech, language) is similar to Tok Pisin ''tok'' and its English source ''talk,'' while ''pona'' (good, positive), from Esperanto ''bona'', reflects generic Romance languages|Romance ''bon, buona, etc.'' However, the changes in pronunciation required by the simple phonetic system often make the origins of other words more difficult to see. The word ''lape'' (to sleep, to rest), for example, comes from Dutch language|Dutch ''slapen'' and is cognate with English ''sleep''; ''kepeken'' (to use) is somewhat distorted from Dutch ''gebruiken'', and ''akesi'' from ''hagedis'' (lizard) is scarcely recognizable. [Because ''*ti'' is not possible in Toki Pona, Dutch ''di'' becomes ''si.'']<ref name=":3" />

Although only 14 roots (12%) are listed as derived from English, a large number of the Tok Pisin, Esperanto, and other roots are transparently cognate with English, raising the English-friendly portion of the vocabulary to about 30%. The portions of the lexicon from other languages are 15% Tok Pisin, 14% Finnish, 14% Esperanto, 12% Croatian, 10% Acadian French, 9% Dutch, 8% Georgian, 5% Mandarin, 3% Cantonese; one root each from Welsh language|Welsh, Tongan language|Tongan (an English borrowing), Twi|Akan, and an uncertain language (apparently Swahili language|Swahili); four sound symbolism|phonesthetic roots (two which are found in English, one from Japanese language|Japanese, and one which was made up); and one other made-up root (the grammatical particle ''e).''<ref name=":3" />
