A hawker centre or cooked food centre (zh|c=小贩中心|p=xiǎofàn zhōngxīn or zh|c=熟食中心|p=shúshí zhōngxīn) is an open-air complex in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and the Riau Islands in Indonesia housing many stalls that sell a variety of price|inexpensive food. They are typically found in city centres, near public housing estates or transport hubs (such as bus station|bus interchanges or train stations).

Hawker centres were set up as a more sanitary option to street-side outdoor alfresco hawker dining places. Instead of mobile food hawker carts, permanent stalls in open air buildings are provided for the hawkers. Either common shared or stall dedicated tables and chairs are provided for customers. This concept has totally eliminated street hawkers in Singapore and reduced the numbers of street hawkers in major cities in South East Asia. This phenomenon is also helped by hawker licensing laws. However, it hinders new entrepreneurs with low capital from starting business, resulting in higher prices for established hawker centre stalls. However, hawker centres can provide a one-stop destination with a good variety of high quality, sanitary food at inexpensive prices for everyone.

In Singapore

Hawker centres sprang up in urban area|urban areas following the rapid urbanization|urbanisation in the 1950s and 1960s. In many cases, they were built partly to address the problem of unhygienic food preparation by unlicensed street hawkers. More recently, they have become less ubiquitous due to growing affluence in the urban populations of Malaysia and Singapore. Particularly in Singapore, they are increasingly being replaced by food courts, which are indoor, air conditioning|air conditioned versions of hawker centres located in shopping malls and other commercial venues.

In the 1950s and 1960s, hawker centres were considered to be a venue for the less affluent. They had a reputation for hygiene|unhygienic food, partly due to the frequent appearance of Feral|stray domestic pets and pest (animal)|pests. Many hawker centres were poorly managed by their operators, often lacking tap water|running water and proper facilities for Washing|cleaning. More recently, hygiene standards have improved, with pressure from the local authorities. This includes the implementation of licensing requirements, where a sufficient standard of hygiene is required for the stall to operate, and rewarding exceptionally good hygiene. Upgrading or reconstruction of hawker centres was initiated in the late 1990s in Singapore.

The hawker centres in Singapore are owned by three government bodies, namely the National Environment Agency (NEA) under the parent Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR), Housing and Development Board (HDB) and JTC Corporation. All the centres owned by HDB and NEA, in turn, are regulated by NEA with the individual Town Councils managing the HDB owned centres. JTC owned centres are self-managed.

As of 2016, two Singaporean food stands, both located in hawker centres, became the first street food vendors to be awarded a Michelin Guide|Michelin Star for excellence in eating. The two stalls are Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle and Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/singapore/articles/singapore-street-food-stalls-get-michelin-star/|title=Singapore street food stalls get Michelin star|access-date=2016-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922233916/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/singapore/articles/singapore-street-food-stalls-get-michelin-star/|archive-date=2016-09-22|dead-url=no|df=</ref>

Thanks to the gentrification of Singapore, more hawker centres are getting a face lift to reach out to younger Singaporeans.

In Hong Kong

In Hong Kong, most cooked food centres (熟食中心; or cooked food markets, 熟食市場) are either located in market complexes of residential districts, or as a standalone structure (this being the case in most industrial areas), with only a few exceptions (e.g. Mong Kok Cooked Food Market is located in the lower levels of Langham Place Hotel). Cooked food centres are managed by Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.

Most of the stalls from hawker centres are converted from former dai pai dong by strict regulations and management; the Hong Kong Government regards the provision of cooked food centres as a way to eliminate traditional dai pai dongs from local streets in the 1970s in Hong Kong|1970s. During the industrial boom in the 1960s in Hong Kong|1960s and 1970s, the government also built cooked food markets in industrial areas in order to serve the catering needs of the working class in major industrial centres such as Kwun Tong, Tsuen Wan and Fo Tan.

Stalls in cooked food centres usually provide local cuisine, with those selling exotic delicacies a minority.
