Cretan hieroglyphs are generally considered undeciphered hieroglyphs found on artefacts of early Bronze Age Crete, during the Minoan civilization|Minoan era. It predates Linear A by about a century, but the two writing systems continued to be used in parallel for most of their history.<ref>Yule 1981, 170-1</ref>

Corpus
In 1989, Jean-Pierre Olivier described the state of the Cretan hieroglyphs corpus as follows,

quote|In short, our Corpus is composed of two distinct parts:

# Seals and sealings (c. 150 documents)
# Other documents (mainly archival inscriptions) inscribed on clay (c. 120 documents).

The seals and sealings represent about 307 distinct sign-groups, consisting all together of ± 832 signs. The other inscriptions represent about 274 distinct sign-groups, consisting all together of ± 723 signs.<ref>Jean-Pierre Olivier, [http://www2.ulg.ac.be/archgrec/IMG/aegeum/Aegaeum5(pdf)/Olivier.pdf The Relationship between Inscriptions on Hieroglyphic Seals and those Written on Archival Documents (PDF file).] in Palaima, Thomas G, ed., ''Aegean seals, sealings and administration''. Université de Liège, Histoire de l'art et archéologie de la Grèce antique, 1990</ref>

More documents, such as those from the Petras deposit, have been published since then.

The known corpus has been edited in 1996 as ''CHIC'' (Olivier/Godard 1996), mainly excavated at four locations: 
*"Quartier Mu" at Malia (city)|Malia (MM II)
*the hieroglyphic deposit at Malia palace (MM III)
*the hieroglyphic deposit at Knossos (MM II or III)
*the Petras deposit (MM IIB): a hieroglyphic archive excavated starting in 1995. Definitive edition was published in 2010.<ref>Metaxia Tsipopoulou & Erik Hallager, ''The Hieroglyphic Archive at Petras, Siteia'' (with contributions by Cesare D’Annibale & Dimitra Mylona).

The Danish Institute at Athens. Athens, 2010 ISBN|978-87-7934-293-4</ref>

The corpus consists of:
*clay documents with incised inscriptions (CHIC H: 1-122)
*sealstone impressions (CHIC I: 123-179)
*sealstones (CHIC S: 180-314)
*the Malia altar stone
*the Phaistos Disc
*the Arkalochori Axe
*seal fragment HM 992, showing a single symbol, identical to  Phaistos Disk glyph 21Citation needed|date=June 2009.

The relation of the last three items with the script of the main corpus is uncertain.

Some Cretan Hieroglyphic (as well as Linear A) inscriptions were also found on the island of Samothrace in the northeastern Aegean.<ref>Margalit Finkelberg, [http://www2.ulg.ac.be/archgrec/IMG/aegeum/aegaeum18(pdf)/31%20Finkelberg.pdf ''Bronze Age Writing: Contacts between East and West''.] In E. H. Cline and D. Harris-Cline (eds.). ''The Aegean and the Orient in the Second Millennium''. Proceedings of the 50th Anniversary Symposium, Cincinnati, 18–20 April 1997. Liège 1998. Aegeum 18 (1998) 265-272.</ref>

It has been suggested that there was an evolution of the hieroglyphs into the linear scripts. Also, some relations to Anatolian hieroglyphs have been suggested.

quote|The overlaps between the Cretan script and other scripts, such as the hieroglyphic scripts of Cyprus and the Hittite lands of Anatolia, may suggest ... that they all evolved from a common ancestor, a now-lost script perhaps originating in Syria.<ref name="Minoans">Rodney Castleden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=g8eIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA100 ''Minoans''.] Routledge, 2002 ISBN|1134880642 p.100</ref>

Symbol inventories have been compiled by Evans (1909),  Meijer (1982), and Olivier/Godart (1996). The known corpus was edited in 1996 as ''CHIC'' (Olivier/Godard 1996), listing a total of 314 items (documents).

The glyph inventory as presented by CHIC includes 96 syllabograms (representing sounds), ten of which double as logograms (representing words or portions of words).

There are also 23 logograms representing four levels of numerals (units, tens, hundreds, thousands), numerical fractions, and two types of punctuation.

Many symbols have apparent Linear A counterparts, so that it is tempting to insert Linear B sound values.Citation needed|date=November 2018
