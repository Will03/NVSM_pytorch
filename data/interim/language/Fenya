Fenya (lang-rus|феня|p=ˈfʲenʲə) or fenka (lang-rus|фенька|p=ˈfʲenʲkə) is a Russian cant language used among criminals. Originally it was a cryptolanguage of '':ru:Офеня|ofenyas'' or ''ofenes'', old Russian peddlers, and had a number of names, or it might come from the Russian word фен or fen which is the Foehn wind|west wind. There are no convincing explanations about the origins of the words "ofenya" and "fenya". In modern Russian language it is also referred to as blatnoy language (Russian: блатной язык), where "blatnoy" is a slang expression for "criminal". It is also widely used in "thieves' songs".

Overview
The grammar of fenya is Russian; the vocabulary has changed over time.

The original ''fenya'' consisted of broken Russian words borrowed from Greek and other foreign languages. Vladimir Dahl in his ''Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language'' gives the following examples:
*"Ропа кимать, полумеркот, рыхло закурещат ворыханы." (''Ropa kimatj, polumerkot, ryhlo zakureščat voryhany.'')
*:Normative Russian: "Пора спать, полночь; скоро запоют петухи." (''Pora spatj, polnoč; skoro zapojut petuhi.'')
*:Translation: "Time to go to bed, <it's> midnight; roosters will sing soon."
*"Да позагорбил басве слемзить: астона басвинска ухалила дряботницей." (''Da pozagorbil basve slemzitj; astona basvinska uhalila driabotnicej.'')
*:Normative Russian: "Да позабыл тебе сказать: жена твоя померла весною." (''Da pozabyl tebe skazatj: žena tvoja pomerla vesnoju.'')
*:Translation: "Oh, I forgot to tell you: your wife died this spring"

Also, ''fenya'' included usual Russian words in unusual meanings, like шаблон ''shablon'' (template) for military or police headwear, педаль ''pedal'' for cellphone (recent addition).

The vocabulary changed over time, with notable infusion of words of Yiddish origin.<ref>cite web |author=Moe |url=http://antisys.narod.ru/bf.html |title=Отдельные вопросы этимологии блатной фени (Russian) |publisher=Antisys.narod.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319015658/http://antisys.narod.ru/bf.html |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= </ref> During the times of the Soviet Union ''fenya'' penetrated into common spoken Russian and can no longer be considered cryptic, although it is still commonly associated with those who have connections to the Russian criminal culture or who have spent a significant amount of time incarcerated.

A number  of explanations for this phenomenon are suggested. For one, a significant part of the population, not necessarily criminals, went through labor camps, and massive indiscriminate amnesties after the death of Joseph Stalin resulted in a penetration of the subculture of convicts into everyday life in the form of a shock wave.<ref>Examples of certain Russian language expressions' analysis can be found in ''The Gulag Archipelago''pages needed|date= September 2017</ref> Particularly, many writers, poets, and journalists who had been arrested began to use fenya in their work after release. Another reason comes from the fact that criminal life was romanticized in popular culture: for example, in the form of "blatnaya song", see Shanson. Few "common" Russians possess a complete or even complex understanding of fenya and fewer still - for various reasons - will admit to it.

''Fenya'' influences Russian culture in different ways. In particular, a whole subgenre of Russian humour exists, in which a known tale, such as ''Romeo and Juliet'' or a popular Russian fairy tale is cast into ''fenya''.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the appearance of "New Russians" introduced new changes into ''fenya'', notably assigning new meanings and accents to common words.

In January 2016, the use of profanity and fenya by prisoners in pretrial detention centers was banned in the Russian prison system. This follows a 2013 ban on the use of fenya by prison guards.<ref>Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/world/europe/russia-bans-foul-language-in-some-prisons-no-word-on-enforcement.html |title=New Prison Rule in Russia: No Swearing |first= Andrew E. |last= Kramer |date=January 14, 2016 | work= The New York Times |access-date=January 16, 2016</ref>
