 History 
In the early 1950s, members of the American Dialect Society felt that there ought to be another organization focused on the function of proper nouns. On December 29, 1951,<ref name=":1" /> in Detroit, a group of academics voted to create the American Name Society, which would focus on onomastics and publish a quarterly journal with content written by society members. The founders appointed a Sponsoring Committee with 29 members and elected a president, Elsdon C. Smith.<ref>Cite journal|last=Unknown|date=1952-06-01|title=American Name Society|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/8133|journal=Indiana Magazine of History|issn=1942-9711</ref> The first meeting was held on December 27, 1952, in Boston.  The ANS has had a broad scope since its inception, and attracts specialists from a variety of fields.<ref name=":1" />

 ''Names'' 
In March 1953, the ANS began publishing ''Names'',<ref name=":1" /> "a journal of onomastics."<ref name=":2">Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&journalCode=ynam20|title=Names: Aim and Scope|last=|first=|date=|website=Taylor & Francis Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 April 2018</ref> The first volume of ''Names'', the journal published by ANS, was published in March 1953, edited by Erwin Gudde.<ref name=":1" /> George R.

 Name of the Year 
Since 2004, the ANS has declared a Name of the Year. Each year, the public can nominate a name by contacting the Name of the Year election coordinator with justification for the name's inclusion. ANS members can also nominate names at the annual meeting. Nominated names are judged on three criteria: linguistic innovation, potential to impact language use, and ability to capture national attention.<ref>Cite journal|last=Nuessel|first=Frank|date=12 May 2017|title=Editorial|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00277738.2017.1316003|journal=Names|volume=65|pages=63-64|via=Taylor and Francis Online</ref> Since 2008, the ANS has voted on the top personal name, place name, trade name and fictional name at its annual conference.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.news.appstate.edu/2013/01/29/onomastics/|title=Words with friends; Appalachian professor leads American Name Society » News Archive » Appalachian State University News|access-date=2017-02-20</ref><ref name=":0">Cite news|url=http://www.americannamesociety.org/about/names-of-the-year/|title=Name of the Year !
