Evolutionary biology

Convergent evolution is the independent evolution of similar features in species of different lineages. Convergent evolution creates analogous structures that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups. The cladistic term for the same phenomenon is Cladogram#Measuring homoplasy|homoplasy. The recurrent evolution of flight is a classic example, as flying insects, birds, pterosaurs, and bats have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight. Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are ''analogous'', whereas ''homology (biology)|homologous'' structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions.  Bird, bat, and pterosaur wings are analogous structures, but their forelimbs are homologous, sharing an ancestral state despite serving different functions.

The opposite of convergence is divergent evolution, where related species evolve different traits. Convergent evolution is similar to parallel evolution, which occurs when two independent species evolve in the same direction and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, flying frog|gliding frogs have evolved in parallel from multiple types of tree frog.

Many instances of convergent evolution are known in plants, including the repeated development of C4 photosynthesis|C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, seed dispersal by fleshy fruits adapted to be eaten by animals, and carnivorous plant|carnivory.

Overview
File:Analogous & Homologous Structures.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Homology (biology)|Homology and analogy in mammals and insects: on the horizontal axis, the structures are homologous in morphology, but different in function due to differences in habitat. On the vertical axis, the structures are analogous in function due to similar lifestyles but anatomically different with different phylogeny.efn|However, evolutionary developmental biology has identified deep homology between insect and mammal body plans, to the surprise of many biologists.
further|List of examples of convergent evolution

In morphology, analogous traits arise when different species live in similar ways and/or a similar environment, and so face the same environmental factors. When occupying similar ecological niches (that is, a distinctive way of life) similar problems can lead to similar solutions.<ref>cite book|last=Kirk|first=John Thomas Osmond|title=Science & Certainty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTr5BTxMpFYC&pg=PA79|year=2007|publisher=Csiro Publishing|isbn=978-0-643-09391-1|page=79 |quote=evolutionary convergence, which, quoting ..

 Distinctions 

=Cladistics=
In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait shared by two or more Taxon|taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry are part of the same clade; cladistics seeks to arrange them according to their degree of relatedness to describe their phylogeny. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, from the point of view of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.<ref>Cite journal | last1=Chirat | first1=R. | last2=Moulton | first2=D.

=Atavism=
main|Atavism

In some cases, it is difficult to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (genetic drift|selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.<ref>Cite journal| last1=Collin | first1=R.| last2=Cipriani | first2=R.| year=2003| title=Dollo's law and the re-evolution of shell coiling| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B| volume=270 | issue=1533 | pages=2551–2555| doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2517| pmc=1691546| pmid=14728776</ref>

=Parallel vs. convergent evolution=

File:Evolutionary trends.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Evolution at an amino acid position. In each case, the left-hand species changes from having alanine (A) at a specific position in a protein in a hypothetical ancestor, and now has serine (S) there. The right-hand species may undergo divergent evolution|divergent, parallel, or convergent evolution at this amino acid position relative to the first species.

When two species are similar in a particular character, evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors were also similar, and convergent if they were not.efn|However, all organisms share a common ancestor more or less recently, so the question of how far back to look in evolutionary time and how similar the ancestors need to be for one to consider parallel evolution to have taken place is not entirely resolved within evolutionary biology. Some scientists have argued that there is a continuum between parallel and convergent evolution, while others maintain that despite some overlap, there are still important distinctions between the two.<ref>cite journal|last=Arendt |first=J |author2=Reznick, D |title=Convergence and parallelism reconsidered: what have we learned about the genetics of adaptation?|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|date=January 2008|volume=23|issue=1 |pages=26–32 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2007.09.011|pmid=18022278 </ref><ref>cite journal |last=Pearce |first=T. |title=Convergence and Parallelism in Evolution: A Neo-Gouldian Account |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |date=10 November 2011 |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=429–448 |doi=10.1093/bjps/axr046</ref><ref name="Zhang">cite journal | last1=Zhang | first1=J. | last2=Kumar | first2=S. | year=1997 | title=Detection of convergent and parallel evolution at the amino acid sequence level | journal=Mol.

When the ancestral forms are unspecified or unknown, or the range of traits considered is not clearly specified, the distinction between parallel and convergent evolution becomes more subjective.  For instance, the striking example of similar placental and marsupial forms is described by Richard Dawkins in ''The Blind Watchmaker'' as a case of convergent evolution, because mammals on each continent had a long evolutionary history prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs under which to accumulate relevant differences.<ref>cite book| last=Dawkins| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Dawkins| year= 1986| title=The Blind Watchmaker| publisher=W.

main| catalytic triad
The enzymology of proteases provides some of the clearest examples of convergent evolution. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to converge on equivalent solutions independently and repeatedly.<ref name="Buller&Townsend_2013"/><ref>cite journal |last=Dodson |first=G. |author2=Wlodawer, A. |title=Catalytic triads and their relatives |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |date=September 1998 |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=347–52 |pmid=9787641 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01254-7</ref>

Serine and cysteine proteases use different amino acid functional groups (alcohol or thiol) as a nucleophile. In order to activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a catalytic triad. The chemical and physical constraints on enzyme catalysis have caused identical triad arrangements to evolve independently more than 20 times in different enzyme superfamilies.<ref name="Buller&Townsend_2013"/>

Threonine proteases use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary alcohol (i.e. has a methyl group). The methyl group of threonine greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate, as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or the histidine base. Consequently, most threonine proteases use an N-terminal threonine in order to avoid such steric clashes.
Several evolutionarily independent enzyme superfamilies with different protein folds use the N-terminal residue as a nucleophile. This commonality of active site but difference of protein fold indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those families.<ref name="Buller&Townsend_2013"/><ref>cite journal |last=Ekici|first=O.

Birds and bats have homology (biology)|homologous limbs because they are both ultimately derived from terrestrial tetrapods, but their flight mechanisms are only analogous, so their wings are examples of functional convergence. The two groups have powered flight, evolved independently.  Their wings differ substantially in construction. The bat wing is a membrane stretched across four extremely elongated fingers and the legs. The airfoil of the bird wing is made of feathers, strongly attached to the forearm (the ulna) and the highly fused bones of the wrist and hand (the carpometacarpus), with only tiny remnants of two fingers remaining, each anchoring a single feather. So, while the wings of bats and birds are functionally convergent, they are not anatomically convergent.<ref name=BerkeleyHomologyAnalogy>cite web |title=Homologies and analogies |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_09 |publisher=University of California Berkeley |accessdate=2017-01-10</ref><ref>cite web |title=Plant and Animal Evolution |url=http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/Homology.shtml |publisher=University of Waikato |accessdate=2017-01-10</ref> Birds and bats also share a high concentration of cerebrosides in the skin of their wings.

Insect mouthparts show many examples of convergent evolution.

Convergent evolution of many groups of insects led from original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types.

Opposable thumbs allowing the grasping of objects are most often associated with primates, like humans, monkeys, apes, and lemurs. Opposable thumbs also evolved in giant pandas, but these are completely different in structure, having six fingers including the thumb, which develops from a wrist bone entirely separately from other fingers.<ref>cite web|title=When is a thumb a thumb?|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/analogy_06|website=Understanding Evolution|accessdate=2015-08-14</ref>

Convergent evolution in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour.

It appears certain that there was some lightening of skin colour ''before'' European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to ''different'' genetic changes.<ref>cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=M.| display-authors=etal |title=Association of the OCA2 Polymorphism His615Arg with Melanin Content in East Asian Populations: Further Evidence of Convergent Evolution of Skin Pigmentation |journal=PLOS Genetics |date=2010 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000867 |volume=6 |issue=3|pages=e1000867 |pmid=20221248 |pmc=2832666</ref>

Lemurs and humans are both primates. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans has been studied in detail and much is known about it. It is not the case that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue eye colour. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the differences between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.<ref>cite journal |last1=Meyer |first1=W.

Carnivory has evolved multiple times independently in plants in widely separated groups. In three species studied, ''Cephalotus|Cephalotus follicularis'', ''Nepenthes alata'' and ''Sarracenia purpurea'', there has been convergence at the molecular level. Carnivorous plants secrete enzymes into the digestive fluid they produce. By studying Purple acid phosphatases|phosphatase, Glycoside hydrolase family 19|glycoside hydrolase, glucanase,  RNASET2|RNAse and chitinase enzymes as well as a pathogenesis-related protein and a thaumatin-related protein,  the authors found many convergent amino acid substitutions. These changes were not at the enzymes' catalytic sites, but rather on the exposed surfaces of the proteins, where they might interact with other components of the cell or the digestive fluid. The authors also found that homologous genes in the non-carnivorous plant ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' tend to have their expression increased when the plant is stressed, leading the authors to suggest that stress-responsive proteins have often been co-optedefn|The prior existence of suitable structures has been called pre-adaptation or exaptation. in the repeated evolution of carnivory.<ref name=Fukushima2017>cite journal |last1=Fukushima |first1=K |last2=Fang |first2=X |display-authors=etal |title=Genome of the pitcher plant Cephalotus reveals genetic changes associated with carnivory |journal=Nature Ecology & Evolution |date=2017 |volume=1 |issue=3 |doi=10.1038/s41559-016-0059 |pmid=28812732 |doi-access=free |page=0059</ref>

Phylogenetic reconstruction and Ancestral reconstruction|ancestral state reconstruction proceed by assuming that evolution has occurred without convergence. Convergent patterns may, however, appear at higher levels in a phylogenetic reconstruction, and are sometimes explicitly sought by investigators. The methods applied to infer convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected. Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of natural selection.<ref name="Stayton2">Cite journal |last=Stayton |first=C.

Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.<ref name="Stayton2" />

Distance-based measures assess the degree of similarity between lineages over time. Frequency-based measures assess the number of lineages that have evolved in a particular trait space.<ref name="Stayton2" />

Methods to infer process-based convergence fit models of selection to a phylogeny and continuous trait data to determine whether the same selective forces have acted upon lineages. This uses the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process|Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to test different scenarios of selection. Other methods rely on an ''A priori knowledge|a priori'' specification of where shifts in selection have occurred.<ref>Cite journal |last=Ingram |first=Travis |last2=Mahler |first2=D.
