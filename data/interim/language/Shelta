Linguistically Shelta is today seen as a mixed language that stems from a community of travelling people in Ireland that was originally predominantly Irish language|Irish-speaking. The community later went through a period of widespread bilingualism that resulted in a language based heavily on Hiberno-English with heavy influences from Irish.<ref name = "Queen's"/> As different varieties of Shelta display different degrees of anglicisation (see below), it is hard to determine the extent of the Irish substratum. The ''Oxford Companion to the English Language'' puts it at 2,000–3,000 words.<ref name=McArthur/>

Names and etymology
The language is known by various names. People outside the Traveller community often refer to it as ''Cant (language)|(the) Cant'', the etymology of which is a matter of debate.<ref name = "Queen's"/> Speakers of the language refer to it as ''(the) Cant'',<ref name=McArthur/> ''Gammon''<ref name=McArthur/><ref name = "Queen's"/> or ''Tarri''.<ref name=McArthur/> Amongst linguists, the name ''Shelta'' is the most commonly used term.<ref name = "Queen's"/>

Variants of the above names and additional names include ''Bog Latin'',<ref name=McArthur/> ''Caintíotar'',Citation needed|date=March 2010 ''Gammon'',<ref name=Dolan>Dolan, Terence Patrick (ed.) ''A Dictionary of Hiberno-English'' (2004) Gill & MacMillan ISBN|0-7171-3535-7</ref> ''Sheldru'',<ref name=McArthur/> ''Shelter'',<ref name=McArthur/> ''Shelteroch'',<ref name=McArthur/> ''the Ould Thing'',<ref name=McArthur/> ''Tinker's Cant''.<ref name=McArthur/>

=Etymology=
The word Shelta appears in print for the first time in 1882 in the book ''The Gypsies'' by the "gypsiologist" Charles Leland, who claimed to have discovered it as the "fifth Celtic tongue". The etymology of the word has long been a matter of debate: Modern Celtic studies|Celticists are convinced that Irish ''lang|ga|siúl'' IPA-ga|ʃuːlʲ "to walk" is at the root, either via a term such as ''lang|ga|siúltóir'' IPA-ga|ʃuːlˠt̪ˠoːrʲ "a walker" or a form of the gerund ''lang|ga|siúladh'' (cf. ''an lucht siúlta'' IPA-ga|ənˠ lˠuxt̪ ʃuːlˠt̪ˠə||, "the walking people" (lit. ''the people of walks''),<ref>Collins Irish Dictionary, HarperCollins 2006</ref> the traditional Irish term for Travellers).<ref name = "Queen's"/> The ''Dictionary of Hiberno-English'' cites it as possibly a corruption of the word "Celt".<ref name=Dolan/> Since Shelta is a mixture of English and Irish grammar, the etymology is not straightforward. The language is made up mostly of Irish lexicon, being classified as a grammar-lexicon language with the grammar being English-based.<ref>Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=978 90 272 5271 5|location=Amsterdam|pages=381</ref>

Origins and history
Linguists have been documenting Shelta since at least the 1870s. The first works were published in 1880 and 1882 by Charles Leland.<ref name = "Queen's"/> Celtic language expert Kuno Meyer and Romani language|Romani expert John Sampson (linguist)|John Sampson both assert that Shelta existed as far back as the 13th century.<ref>Meyer, Kuno. 1909. The secret languages of Ireland. Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society, New Series, 2: 241–6.</ref>

In the earliest but undocumented period linguists surmise that the Traveller community was Irish language|Irish-speaking until a period of widespread bilingualism in Irish and Hiberno-English (or Scots in Scotland) set in, leading to Creole language|creolisation (possibly with a trilingual stage).<ref name = "Queen's"/> The resulting language is referred to as ''Old Shelta'' and it is suspected that this stage of the language displayed distinctive features, such as non-English syntactic and morphological features, no longer found in Shelta.<ref name = "Queen's"/>

Within the diaspora, various sub-branches of Shelta exist. English Shelta is increasingly undergoing anglicisation, while American Irish-Traveller's Cant, originally also synonymous with Shelta, has by now been almost fully anglicised.<ref name=McArthur/>

Linguistic features
Sociologist Sharon Gmelch describes the Travellers' language as follows:<ref>Cite book |last=Gmelch |first=Sharon |title=Nan: The Life of an Irish Travelling Woman |year=1986 |publisher=Souvenir Press |location=London |isbn=0-285-62785-6 |page=234 </ref>

quote|Irish Travelers use a secret argot or cant known as Gammon. It is used primarily to conceal meaning from outsiders, especially during business transactions and in the presence of police. Most Gammon utterances are terse and spoken so quickly that a non-Traveler might conclude the words merely had been garbled. Most Gammon words were formed from Irish language|Irish by applying four techniques: reversal, Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis, affixing, and substitution. In the first, an Irish word is reversed to form a Gammon one – ''mac'', or son, in Irish became ''kam'' in Gammon. In the second, consonants or consonant clusters were transposed. Thirdly, a sound or cluster of sounds were either prefixed or suffixed to an Irish word. Some of the more frequently prefixed sounds were ''s'', ''gr'', and ''g''. For example, ''Obair'', work or job, became ''gruber'' in Gammon. Lastly, many Gammon words were formed by substituting an arbitrary consonant or consonant cluster in an Irish word. In recent years, modern slang and Romani language|Romani (the language of the Romani people|gypsies) words have been incorporated. The grammar and syntax are English. The first vocabulary collected from Irish Travelers was published in 1808, indicating that Gammon dates at least back to the 1700s. But many early Celtic scholars who studied it, including the eminent Kuno Meyer, concluded it was much older.

Thus, it is not mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible with either English or Irish, out of design.

Shelta is a secret language. Travellers do not like to share the language with outsiders, named “Buffers”, or non-travellers. When speaking Shelta in front of Buffers, Travellers will disguise the structure so as to make it seem like they aren't speaking Shelta at all.<ref>Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=978 90 272 5271 5|location=Amsterdam|pages=80</ref>

=Lexicon=
While Shelta is influenced by English grammar, it is also a mixture of Gaelic and Irish words as well. The word order itself is altered, with syllables reversed and many of the original words are Irish that have been altered or reversed. Many Shelta words have been disguised using techniques such as back slang where sounds are transposed (for example ''gop'' "kiss" from Irish ''póg'') or the addition of sounds (for example ''gather'' "father" from Irish ''athair'').<ref name=McArthur/> Other examples include ''lackin'' or ''lakeen'' "girl" from Irish ''cailín'', and the word ''rodas'' "door" from Irish ''doras''. The word for “son” is changed from the Gaelic ''mac'' to the Shelta ''kam.''<ref>Cite journal|last=Harper and Hudson|first=Jared and Charles|date=1971|title=Irish Traveler Cant|url=|journal=Journal of English Linguistics|volume=5|pages=80|via=</ref>

It also contains a certain number of introduced lexical items from Romani such as the term ''gadje'' "non-Traveller" or "kushti" (from the Romanichal word for "good"). Ten percent of the Gammon language comes from Romani language|Romani.<ref>Jean-Pierre Liégeois, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3A2bGG3_NAYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Roma+in+europe&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ApPkU5DWMpPT7Aac2IDgCg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Roma%20in%20europe&f=false Roma in Europe], Council of Europe, 2007, p. 43</ref>

=Grammar=
Shelta shares its main syntactic features with Hiberno-English and the majority of its morphological features such as -s plurals and past tense markers.<ref name = "Queen's"/> Compare:

= Phonology =
Shelta has 27 consonants and six vowels.

The consonants are /p, pʲ, b, bʲ, m, mʲ, w, t, tʲ, d, dʲ, n, nʲ, θ, ð, r, rʲ, l, ʎ, ʃ, t͡ʃ, y, k, kʲ, g, gʲ, χ/. Many words are complex by incorporating numerous consonants within, as in the word skraχo for “tree, bush’ with the consonant /χ/ being a hissing sound that is held in the back of the throat, and is held longer than other consonants.<ref>Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=978 90 272 5271 5|location=Amsterdam|pages=381</ref>

Incidentally, there is not as much importance put on gender in Shelta. Plurals are shown with the English suffix /–s/ or /-i/, such as gloχ for “man” becomes gloχi for “men”.<ref>Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=978 90 272 5271 5|location=Amsterdam|pages=382</ref>

Loanwords
Some Shelta words have been borrowed by mainstream English speakers, such as the word "bloke" meaning "a man" in the mid-19th century.<ref>Oxford Dictionary – etymology</ref>

Orthography
There is no standard orthography. Broadly speaking, Shelta can either be written following an Irish-type orthography or an English-type orthography. For example, the word for "married" can either be spelled ''lósped'' or ''lohsped'', a "woman" can either be spelled ''byohr'' or ''beoir''.<ref name = "Queen's"/>

Comparison texts
Below are reproductions of the ''Lord's Prayer'' in Shelta as it occurred a century ago, current Shelta, and modern English and Irish versions for comparison. The 19th century Shelta version shows a high Shelta lexical content while the Cant version shows a much lower Shelta lexical content. Both versions are adapted from Hancock<ref name=Hancock86>Cite journal |doi=10.2307/454664 |last=Hancock |first=I. |year=1986 |title=The cryptolectal speech of the American roads: Traveller Cant and American Angloromani |journal=American Speech |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=206–220 [pp. 207–208] |publisher=Duke University Press |jstor=454664 </ref> who notes that the Cant reproduction is not exactly representative of actual speech in normal situations.
