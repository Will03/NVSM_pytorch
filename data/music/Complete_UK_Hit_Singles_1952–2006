The '''''Complete UK Hit Singles''''' is a book that lists every [[Single (music)|single]] to have made it into the [[UK Singles Chart]] since its inception in 1952. As well as providing chart data on each of the hits, the book also provides a brief biography on each hit maker, together with facts and trivia about each hit, such as whether it qualified for a BPI sales award, was featured in a film or contains a sample of another track. The book was written by Graham Betts and is the companion volume to '''''Complete UK Hit Albums'''''. <!--"It will have the first number #1 single ever recorded to the latest single." Huh?-->
