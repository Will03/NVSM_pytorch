{{more citations needed|date=October 2012}}

This is a list of artists that have reached number-one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] as recorded by the [[Official Charts Company]].

Artists are listed alphabetically and separately if more than one artist is credited on a song (e.g. [[John Travolta]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] each get separate credits for their duets from ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''). Artists who performed on a song but not credited are not included although notable cases may be recorded in the ''Notes'' column. In the 20th century guest musicians or singers were sometimes credited and sometimes not, while it became more common to include ''featured'' artists in the early 21st century.

This list covers all chart weeks up to the week ending 10 September 2015.<!--Please update list from this date. http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/all-the-number-1-singles__7931/ is the official list-->
