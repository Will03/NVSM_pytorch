{{Culture of Australia}}
The '''music of Australia''' has an extensive history made of music societies. [[Indigenous Australian music]] is a part of the unique heritage of a 40,000 to 60,000 year history which produced the iconic [[didgeridoo]]. Contemporary fusions of indigenous and Western styles (exemplified in the works of [[No Fixed Address (band)|No Fixed Address]], [[Yothu Yindi]], [[Christine Anu]] and [[Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu]]) mark distinctly Australian contributions to [[world music]]. During its early [[Western civilisation|western]] history, Australia was a collection of British colonies, and [[Australian folk music]] and [[bush ballad]]s such as "[[Waltzing Matilda]]" were heavily influenced by [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] traditions, while [[classical music|classical]] forms were derived from those of Europe. Contemporary Australian music ranges across a broad spectrum with [[Timeline of trends in Australian music|trends]] often concurrent with [[Music of the United States|those of the US]], the [[Music of the United Kingdom|UK]], and similar nations – notably in the [[Australian rock]] and [[Australian country music]] genres. Tastes have diversified along with post-[[World War II]] multicultural [[immigration to Australia]].

Notable Australian musicians include: the children's band [[The Wiggles]]; the opera singers Dame [[Nellie Melba]] and Dame [[Joan Sutherland]]; the [[bass-baritone]] [[Peter Dawson (bass-baritone)|Peter Dawson]], [[country music]] stars [[Slim Dusty]] (Australia's biggest selling domestic artist), [[Smoky Dawson]] and [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]]; solo artists [[John Farnham]], [[Olivia Newton-John]] (five No. 1 Hot 100 hits, like "[[You're the One That I Want]]"), [[Rick Price]], [[Missy Higgins]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Natalie Imbruglia]], [[Guy Sebastian]], [[Dami Im]], [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Sia Furler]], [[Cody Simpson]], [[Jessica Mauboy]], [[Havana Brown (musician)|Havana Brown]], [[Gotye]] (No. 1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 hit with "[[Somebody That I Used to Know]]" ft.

==Folk music==
{{main|Australian folk music}}
[[File:The Old Bush Songs by Banio Paterson.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover to [[Banjo Paterson]]'s seminal 1905 collection of bush ballads, entitled ''The Old Bush Songs'']]

For much of its history, Australia's bush music belonged to an oral and folkloric tradition, and was only later published in print in volumes such as [[Banjo Paterson]]'s ''Old Bush Songs'', in the 1890s. The distinctive themes and origins of Australia's "bush music" or "[[bush band]] music" can be traced to the songs sung by the convicts who were sent to Australia during the early period of the British colonisation, beginning in 1788. Early Australian ballads sing of the harsh ways of life of the epoch and of such people and events as [[bushranger]]s, [[swagmen]], [[Drover (Australian)|drovers]], [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[sheep shearer|shearer]]s. Convict and bushranger verses often railed against government tyranny. Classic bush songs on such themes include: "[[The Wild Colonial Boy]]", "[[Click Go the Shears]]", "The Drover's Dream", "The Queensland Drover", "The Dying Stockman" and "[[Moreton Bay (song)|Moreton Bay]]".<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/bush/ Bush songs and music – Australia's Culture Portal]. Cultureandrecreation.gov.au. Retrieved on 2011-04-14.</ref>

Later themes which endure to the present include the experiences of war, of droughts and flooding rains, of [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginality]] and of the railways and trucking routes which link Australia's vast distances. Isolation and loneliness of life in the [[Australian bush]] have been another theme. "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", often regarded as Australia's unofficial [[national anthem]], is a quintessential Australian folk song, influenced by Celtic folk ballads. Country and folk artists such as [[Tex Morton]], [[Slim Dusty]], [[Rolf Harris]], [[The Bushwackers (band)|The Bushwackers]], [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]], and [[John Schumann]] of the band [[Redgum]] have continued to record and popularise the old bush ballads of Australia through the 20th and into the 21st century – and contemporary artists including [[Sara Storer]] and [[Lee Kernaghan]] draw heavily on this heritage.

Australia has a unique tradition of folk music, with origins in both the indigenous music traditions of the original Australian inhabitants, as well as the introduced folk music (including [[sea shanties]]) of 18th and 19th century Europe. [[Celts|Celtic]], [[English people|English]], [[Germans|German]] and [[Scandinavian folklore|Scandinavian]] folk traditions predominated in this first wave of European immigrant music. The Australian tradition is, in this sense, related to the traditions of other countries with similar ethnic, historical and political origins, such as [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]]. The Australian indigenous tradition brought to this mix of novel elements, including new instruments, some of which are now internationally familiar, such as the [[didgeridoo]] of Northern Australia. A number of British singers have spent periods in Australia and have included Australian material in their repertoires, e.g. [[A. L. Lloyd]], Martin Wyndham-Read and [[Eric Bogle]].

===Folk revival===
[[File:FIL 2016 - Eric Bogle 3149.jpg|thumb|[[Eric Bogle]]]]

Notable Australian exponents of the folk revival movement included both European immigrants such as [[Eric Bogle]], noted for his sad lament to the [[battle of Gallipoli]] "[[And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]", and indigenous Australians like [[Archie Roach]] and [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]]. Kelly's lyrics capture the vastness of the culture and landscape of Australia by chronicling life about him for over 30 years. David Fricke from Rolling Stone calls Kelly "one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise." In the 1970s, Australian Folk Rock brought both familiar and less familiar traditional songs, as well as new compositions, to live venues and the airwaves. Notable artists include [[The Bushwackers (band)|The Bushwacker Band]] and [[Redgum]]. Redgum are known for their 1983 anti-war protest song "[[I Was Only Nineteen]]", which peaked at No. 1 on the National singles charts. The 1990s brought Australian indigenous folk rock to the world, led by bands including [[Yothu Yindi]]. Australia's long and continuous folk tradition continues strongly to this day, with elements of folk music still present in many contemporary artists including those generally thought of as [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Heavy metal music|Heavy Metal]] and [[Alternative Music]].

Ragtime, light ephemera) in the early twentieth century include [[Vince Courtney]], [[Herbert De Pinna]], [[Jack Lumsdaine]], [[Joe Slater (composer)|Joe Slater]], [[Reginald Stoneham]] and [[Herbert Cosgrove]], among others. Demand for local works declined with recording and broadcast.

Australia has a long tradition of country music, which has developed a style quite distinct from its US counterpart. The early roots of Australian country are related to [[folk music|traditional folk music]] traditions of Ireland, England, Scotland and many diverse nations. "[[Botany Bay (song)|Botany Bay]]" from the late 19th century is one example. "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", often regarded by foreigners as Australia's unofficial [[national anthem]], is a quintessential Australian country song, influenced more by Celtic folk ballads than by American Country and Western music. This strain of Australian country music, with lyrics focusing on strictly Australian subjects, is generally known as "bush music" or "[[bush band]] music."  The most successful Australian bush band is Melbourne's [[The Bushwackers (band)|The Bushwackers]], active since the early 1970s, other well-known country singers include [[Reg Lindsay]], bush balladeer singer [[Buddy Williams (country musician)|Buddy Williams]], and entertainers [[Johnny Ashcroft]] and [[Chad Morgan]].

Another, more Americanized form of Australian country music was pioneered in the 1930s by such recording artists as [[Tex Morton]], and later popularized by [[Slim Dusty]], best remembered for his 1957 song "[[A Pub With No Beer]]", and [[Smoky Dawson]]. Dusty married singer-songwriter [[Joy McKean]] in 1951 and went on to become Australia's biggest selling domestic music artist with more than 7 million record sales.<ref>[http://www.historyofcountrymusic.com.au/slim_chroniclerofthebush.html Slim Dusty – Chronicler of the Bush].

Australian country artists including [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Sherrie Austin]], and [[Keith Urban]] have achieved considerable success in the USA.  In recent years local contemporary country music, featuring much [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] with [[popular music]], had popularity in Australia; notable musicians of this genre include [[David Hudson (musician)|David Hudson]], [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]], [[Gina Jeffreys]], [[Lee Kernaghan]], [[Troy Cassar-Daley]], [[Sara Storer]], [[Felicity Urquhart]] and [[Kasey Chambers]]. Others influenced by the genre include [[Nick Cave]], [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], [[The John Butler Trio]], Jagged Stone and [[The Waifs]]. Popular Australian country songs include [[Click Go the Shears]] (Traditional), [[Lights on the Hill (song)|Lights on the Hill]] (1973), [[I Honestly Love You]] (1974), [[True Blue (John Williamson song)|True Blue]] (1981), and [[Not Pretty Enough]] (2002).

===Children's music===
[[File:Wiggles 2007 Lineup.jpg|thumb|[[The Wiggles]]' lineup in 2007, riding in the Big Red Car during a concert]]

Children's music in Australia developed gradually over the latter half of the 20th century. The most recognised performers in that period were those associated with the long-running [[ABC Television|Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] series ''[[Play School (Australian TV series)|Play School]]'', including veteran actor-musician [[Don Spencer]] and actor and singer [[Noni Hazlehurst]]. Children's music remained a relatively small segment of the Australian music industry until the emergence of groundbreaking children's group [[The Wiggles]] in the late 1990s. The multi-award-winning four-piece group rapidly gained international popularity in the early 2000s and by the end of the decade they had become one of the most popular children's groups in the world. The Wiggles now boasts a huge fanbase in many regions including Australasia, Britain, Asia, and the Americas.

In 2008 The Wiggles were named [[Business Review Weekly]]'s top-earning Australian entertainers for the fourth year in a row having earned [[Australian dollar|A$]]45&nbsp;million in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=183|title=Wiggles beat Kylie Minogue, Russell Crowe to top of earnings list

===R&B and soul music===

[[File:Guy Sebastian and Jimmy Barnes Memphis Tour 7 Mar 2008.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Guy Sebastian]] and [[Jimmy Barnes]] 6 March 2008 State Theatre]]

R&B soul music had a significant impact on Australian's music, although it is notable that many seminal recordings in this genre by American acts of the late 20th century were not played on Australian radio. Anecdotal evidence suggest that racism was a key factor—in his book on the history of Australian radio, author and broadcaster Wayne Mac recounts that when a local Melbourne DJ of the 1960s played the new [[Ike and Tina Turner]] single "[[River Deep Mountain High]]" it was immediately pulled from the playlist by the station's program manager for being "too noisy and too black".<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/boom-times/2006/02/11/1139542439712.html "Boom Times", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 13 February 2006]</ref> As a result, many local soul/R&B hits of this period were cover versions recorded by Australian acts. Despite radio's relucatance to play American soul/R&B originals, these styles were avidly adopted by local performers and covers of soul/R&B standards were staples in the setlists of many acts including [[Max Merritt and the Meteors]], [[Doug Parkinson]], [[Jeff St John]], [[The Groop]], [[The Groove (band)|The Groove]], [[The Twilights]], [[Renee Geyer]] and many others.

[[Renée Geyer]] is an Australian [[vocals|singer]] who came to prominence in the mid-1970s, has long been regarded as one of the finest exponents of [[jazz music|jazz]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[music genres|idioms]].<ref name="McF">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]]|last=McFarlane|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian McFarlane|publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]]|location=[[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards, NSW]]|year=1999|chapter=Encyclopedia entry for 'Renée Geyer'|chapterurl=http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=829|isbn=1-86448-768-2|accessdate=7 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803174326/http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=829|archivedate=3 August 2004|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Howl">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/14231/20120727-0512/www.howlspace.com.au/en/geyerrenee/geyerrenee.htm|url=http://www.howlspace.com.au/en/geyerrenee/geyerrenee.htm|title=Renée Geyer|publisher=HowlSpace – The Living History of Our Music.

Parallel with Geyer's success, American born vocalist [[Marcia Hines]] emerged as one of Australia's most successful solo singers. She first came to prominence in the early 1970s with critically acclaimed roles in the local stage productions of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (in which she was the first African-American to play the role of Mary Magdalene) before launching a solo career. By the late 1970s she was one of Australia's top singing stars, winning several ''[[Queen of Pop]]'' awards and hosting her own national TV variety series.

Following their initial dissolution in 1982 [[Cold Chisel]] lead vocalist [[Jimmy Barnes]] embarked on a successful solo career that has continued from the 1980s to the present. Many of Barnes' albums have featured versions of songs from these genres and his chart-topping album ''[[Soul Deep (Jimmy Barnes album)|Soul Deep]] (1991)'' consisted entirely of covers of classic 1960s soul/R&B covers. Australian soul singer/songwriters like [[Daniel Merriweather]], has after several successful collaborations with artists such as [[Mark Ronson]], released his official debut album, ''Love & War'', in June 2009. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number two.

===Rock and pop===
{{Main|Australian rock}}

Australia has produced a wide variety of [[Australian rock|rock]] and popular music, from the internationally successful groups [[AC/DC]], [[INXS]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Savage Garden]], [[the Seekers]], or pop divas [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Kylie Minogue]] to the popular local content of [[John Farnham]], [[Jimmy Barnes]] or [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]]. [[Indigenous Australian music]] and [[Australian jazz]] have also had crossover influence on this genre.<ref>[http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/pop/ Australian pop music – Australia's Culture Portal]. Cultureandrecreation.gov.au. Retrieved on 2011-04-14.</ref> Early Australian [[rock and roll]] stars included [[Col Joye]] and [[Johnny O'Keefe]]. O'Keefe formed a band in 1956; his hit ''Wild One'' made him the first Australian rock'n'roller to reach the national charts.<ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150610b.htm O'Keefe, John Michael (Johnny) (1935–1978) Biographical Entry – Australian Dictionary of Biography Online].

Retrieved on 2011-04-14.</ref> While US and British content dominated airwaves and record sales into the 1960s, local successes began to emerge – notably [[The Easybeats]] and the folk-pop group [[The Seekers]] had significant local success and some international recognition, while AC/DC had their first hits in Australia before going on to international success.

[[Pub rock (Australia)|Pub rock]] was popular [[Timeline of trends in Australian music#1980s|in the 1980s]], and the era was typified by AC/DC, [[Divinyls]], [[Mental As Anything]], [[Midnight Oil]], [[The Choirboys (band)|The Choirboys]], [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], [[Noiseworks]], [[Air Supply]], [[Cold Chisel]] and [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]]. [[INXS]] and [[Men at Work]] also achieved fame worldwide, and the song "[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]" became an unofficial anthem for Australia. [[Australian hip hop]] began in the early 1980s, primarily influenced by overseas works, but by the 1990s a distinctive local style had emerged, with groups such as the [[Hilltop Hoods]] achieving international acclaim for their work. The [[Timeline of trends in Australian music#1990s|1990s]] saw an increase in the popularity of [[Australian indie rock|indie rock]] in Australia. AC/DC and INXS continued to achieve commercial success in the United States, whilst a multitude of local bands, including [[Jebediah]], [[Magic Dirt]], [[Diana Anaid]] (#1 on the Australian Indie Charts and #26 on the USA ''Billboard'' Chart), [[Spiderbait]], [[The Superjesus]], [[Regurgitator]], [[You Am I]], [[Icecream Hands]], [[Powderfinger]], [[Silverchair]] and [[Something for Kate]], were popular throughout the country. A small [[electronic music]] scene emerged around Sydney and Melbourne, with [[Severed Heads]], and [[Ollie Olsen]]'s [[No (band)|No]] peaking in the 1990s.

Australian music experienced a rock renaissance in the [[Timeline of trends in Australian music#2000s|2000s]] with groups such as [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]], [[Jet (band)|Jet]], [[Airbourne (band)|Airbourne]] and [[Wolfmother]] charting internationally. [[Hilltop Hoods]] were the first Australian hip-hop group to reach the top of the [[ARIA chart]]. [[Network Ten|Channel 10]]'s ''[[Australian Idol]]'' program was highly popular locally, as were the many "idols" produced.

====First wave of Australian rock====
[[File:DelltonesAwards.jpg|thumb|''[[The Delltones]]'' with four radio awards]]

In the mid-1950s, American [[rock and roll]] spread across the world. Sydney's independent [[record label]] [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]] was the first to get on the bandwagon in Australia, releasing [[Bill Haley & His Comets]]' "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" in 1956. It became the biggest-selling Australian single ever released up to that time. American-born entrepreneur [[Lee Gordon (promoter)|Lee Gordon]], who arrived in Australia in 1953, played a key role in establishing the popularity of rock & roll with his famous "Big Show" tours, which brought to Australia many leading American rock'n'roll acts including Bill Haley & His Comets, Little Richard, [[Bo Diddley]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Gene Vincent]], [[Buddy Holly]] & [[The Crickets]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. Gordon was also instrumental in launching the career of [[Johnny O'Keefe]], the first Australian [[rock music|rock]] star, who rose to fame by imitating Americans like [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Little Richard]]. O'Keefe and other "first wave" bands were popular until about 1961, when a wave of clean-cut family bands took their place.

Though mainstream audiences in the early sixties preferred a clean-cut style – epitomised by the acts that appeared on the [[Nine Network]] pop show ''[[Bandstand (Australia)|Bandstand]]'' – there were a number of 'grungier' guitar-oriented bands in major cities like Sydney and Melbourne, who were inspired by American and British instrumental and [[surf music|surf]] acts like Britain's [[The Shadows]] – who exerted an enormous influence on Australian and New Zealand music prior to the emergence of [[The Beatles]] – and American acts like guitar legend [[Dick Dale]] and [[The Surfaris]]. Notable Australian instrumental groups of this period included [[The Atlantics]], The Denvermen, The Thunderbirds, The Planets, The Dee Jays, The Joy Boys, The Fabulous Blue Jays and The Whispers.

[[File:The Easybeats - Friday on My Mind.jpg|right|thumb|"[[Friday on My Mind]]", by [[The Easybeats]]]]

Jazz was another important influence on the first wave of Australian rock. Unlike the musicians in bands such as The Comets, or Elvis Presley's backing band, who had [[rockabilly]] or [[country music]] backgrounds, many musicians in Australian rock'n'roll bands – such as Johnny O'Keefe's famous backing group The Dee Jays – had a solid background in jazz.

====Second wave of Australian rock====

The "second wave" of Australian rock is said to have begun in about 1964, and followed directly on the impact of [[The Beatles]]. In the immediate wake of The Beatles' momentous Australian tour, many local groups that had formerly played guitar-based instrumental music recruited singers and took up the new 'beat' style. Some of the best-known and most popular acts in this period were [[Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs]] and [[Ray Brown & The Whispers]], [[The Easybeats]], [[The Masters Apprentices]], [[The Twilights]], [[The Groop]], [[The Groove (band)|The Groove]], [[The Loved Ones]] and cult acts like [[The Throb]] and solo star [[Normie Rowe]], who quickly became Australia's most popular male pop vocalist. During this period a wave of acts also came from New Zealand, including [[Ray Columbus & the Invaders]], [[Max Merritt|Max Merritt & The Meteors]], [[Dinah Lee]], [[Larry's Rebels]] and [[The La De Das]].

Many Australian bands and singers tried to enhance their careers by moving overseas, in particular to England, then seen as the mecca of popular music but few bands were successful and of those who relocated to the UK only [[The Seekers]] enjoyed any lasting success. Others that made the journey were The Easybeats (the first rock band to crack the UK market), The Twilights, The Groove, Lloyds World and the La De Das.

====Third wave of Australian rock====

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}
The "third wave" of Australian rock began around 1970, by which time most of the major local pop groups of the 1960s had dissolved and former solo stars like [[Normie Rowe]] had faded from view. Few acts from this era attained major international success, and it was even difficult to achieve success across Australia, due to low radio airplay and the increasing dominance of overseas performers on the charts. A pivotal event was the [[1970 radio ban]], which lasted from May to October that year. The Ban was the climax of a simmering "pay for play" dispute between major record companies and commercial radio stations, who refused to pay a proposed new copyright fee for playing pop records on air. The dispute erupted into open conflict in May 1970—many commercial stations boycotted records by the labels involved and refused to list their releases on their Top 40 charts, while the record companies in turn refused to supply radio with free promotional copies of new releases.

An unexpected side-effect of the ban was that several emerging Australian acts signed to independent labels (who were not part of the dispute) scored hits with covers of overseas hits; these included [[The Mixtures]]' cover of [[Mungo Jerry]]'s "[[In the Summertime (Mungo Jerry song)|In the Summertime]]"<ref name="KentDM">{{Citation | title = The place of Go-Set in rock and pop music culture in Australia, 1966 to 1974 | chapter = Appendix 6: The Record Ban | last1 = Kent | first1 = David Martin | publisher = [[University of Canberra]] | date = September 2002 | location = [[Canberra]], ACT | url = http://erl.canberra.edu.au/uploads/approved/adt-AUC20050509.095456/public/02whole.pdf | pages = 265–269 | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6YiGE4tE6?url=http://erl.canberra.edu.au/uploads/approved/adt-AUC20050509.095456/public/02whole.pdf | archivedate = 22 May 2015 | df = dmy-all }} Note: This PDF is 282 pages. Retrieved 20 November 2010</ref> and [[Liv Maessen]]'s cover of Mary Hopkin's [[Eurovision]] song "[[Knock, Knock Who's There?]]".

Despite commercial radio resistance to the more progressive music being produced by bands like [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]] and [[Tully (band)|Tully]], acts as diverse as [[AC/DC]], [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]] and [[John Paul Young]] were able to achieve major success and develop a unique sound for Australian rock. From 1975, key agents for the increased exposure of local music were the nationally broadcast ABC-TV [[television]] pop show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', which premiered in late 1974, and Australia's first non-commercial all-rock [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]] [[Triple J|Double Jay]], which opened in January 1975. [[Hard rock]] bands AC/DC and [[Rose Tattoo]] and harmony rock group [[Little River Band]] also found major overseas success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, touring all over the world. Meanwhile, a score of Australian expatriate solo performers like [[Helen Reddy]], [[Olivia Newton-John]] and [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]] became major stars in the US and internationally. [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]] also formed in the late 1970s.

This period also saw bands like [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] moving towards [[new wave music]], and the late 1970s saw the emergence of pioneering [[punk rock]] bands like [[The Saints (band)|The Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]], as well as [[electronic music]]al groups, such as [[Cybotron (Australian band)|Cybotron]], [[Severed Heads]] and [[Essendon Airport (band)|Essendon Airport]]. Perhaps most influential of the 'underground' scenes, however, was the burgeoning [[Pub rock (Australia)|Australian pub rock]] circuit, which developed in the early 1970s and played a key role in the emergence of major bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s, including [[Cold Chisel]] and [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], and in Sydney [[Midnight Oil]] and [[Matt Finish]]. From the [[post-punk]] music scene which had sprung up in Melbourne came [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Boys Next Door]] featuring [[Nick Cave]]. The Boys Next Door would eventually become [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]].

The Australian Music Industry as a business began to formalise during the late 1960s and the 1970s. Although not taken seriously by the mainstream business community in those early years, none could discount the pioneering spirit and business acumen of the likes of [[Michael Gudinski]], [[Michael Chugg]], [[Ray Evans]], [[Glenn Wheatley]], [[Harry M. Miller]], Harley Medcalf, Michael Browning, Peter Rix, [[Ron Tudor]], [[Roger Davies (manager)|Roger Davies]], Fred Bestall, Lance Reynolds, Alan Hely, Frank Stivala, Sebastian Chase, Philip Jacobsen, Peter Karpin, [[Roger Savage]], [[John Sayers]], Ernie Rose, Bill Armstrong (Australian music producer), [[Kevin Jacobsen]], [[Phil Dwyer (musician)|Phil Dwyer]], Ken Brodziak, Denis Handlin, [[Stan Rofe]], Jade Johnson, Terry Blamey and [[Ian Meldrum|Ian 'Molly' Meldrum]]. These were the people largely responsible for promoting and developing the Australian music 'business' during those formative years.

Clubs and venues catering for the demand of live band entertainment flourished in capital cities all over the country, however, the central development of the Australian Music Industry during these years was in Sydney and Melbourne. Clubs such as [[Chequers]], the Bondi Lifesaver and the Coogee Bay Hotel in Sydney, and the Thumpin Tum, [[Catcher]], Berties, Sebastian's, the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] and the Q Club in Melbourne were synonymous with the biggest names in Australian rock & roll. In 1970 the first ever outdoor music festival, modelled on Woodstock, was held at [[Ourimbah, New South Wales|Ourimbah]] near Sydney, and several other followed over the next two years, but most were a financial failure. In 1972 the first festival that proved successful enough to be repeated was the 1972 '[[Sunbury Pop Festival|Festival]]' which attracted some 35,000 music fans from across the country to [[Sunbury, Victoria|Sunbury]], Melbourne.

'Pop' magazines such as ''[[Go-Set]]'' (which began in 1966), the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', ''RAM'', and ''Juke'', and television programs such as ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', ''Uptight'', ''Sounds Unlimited'' and ''Happening 70'' promoted Australian popular music to a youth market who had never before experienced such media exposure of their idols and stars. 'Pop Stars' were now being created by direct marketing to a targeted teenage audience. Recording studios such as 301, Alberts' and Trafalgar in Sydney and [[Armstrong Studios]] and TCS in Melbourne became legendary. Independent label [[Mushroom Records]] was founded in 1973 and although it struggled to survive for its first two years of existence, it was saved in early 1975 by the nationawide commercial breakthrough of [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]], whose debut LP became the biggest-selling Australian rock album ever released up to that time; this success enabled Mushroom to become a significant player in the Australian music industry and compete with established companies like EMI, CBS and Festival.

The bands and solo artists who shaped Australian Music during these seminal years were: – [[The Choirboys (band)|The Choirboys]], [[INXS]], [[Noiseworks]], [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]], [[AC/DC]], [[Renée Geyer]], [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]], [[Chain (band)|Chain]], [[Daddy Cool (band)|Daddy Cool]], [[Marcia Hines]], [[Zoot (band)|Zoot]], [[The Masters Apprentices]], [[Dragon (band)|Dragon]], [[Air Supply]], [[The Radiators (Australian band)|The Radiators]], [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], [[Axiom (band)|Axiom]], Kevin Borich Express, [[Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band]], [[Carson (band)|Carson]], [[Cheetah (band)|Cheetah]], [[Richard Clapton]], [[Cold Chisel]], [[John Farnham]], Healing Force, [[Lobby Loyde]] and the Coloured Balls, Hawking Bros, Flake, [[Buffalo (band)|Buffalo]], Bjerre, [[Wendy Saddington]], [[The Seekers]], Ronnie Charles, [[Company Caine]], Trevor Spry, [[Radio Birdman]], [[Buster Brown (Australian band)|Buster Brown]], [[Little River Band]], Ray Burgess, [[Mental As Anything]], [[Marty Rhone]], [[Ariel (Australian band)|Ariel]], [[The La De Das]], [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]], [[The Dingoes]], Babeez, [[Mondo Rock]], [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]], [[Midnight Oil]], [[Doug Parkinson]], [[Jon English]], [[Blackfeather]], [[Ronnie Burns (singer)|Ronnie Burns]], The Ferrets, [[Mike Brady (musician)|Mike Brady]], Martin Gellatley, [[Hush (band)|Hush]], [[Tully (band)|Tully]], Madder Lake, [[Supernaut (band)|Supernaut]], [[Russell Morris]], [[Allison Durbin]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Ross D.

====1980s====
[[File:Nick Cave 1986.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Nick Cave]] performing in 1986]]

The 1980s saw a breakthrough in the independence of Australian rock—[[Nick Cave]] said that before the 1980s, "Australia still needed America or England to tell them what was good".<ref name=Longway5>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/longway/episode_5/ |title=Long Way to the Top: INXS to Exile 1976–1988|publisher=[[ABC Online]]|accessdate=8 June 2008}}</ref> [[Shaddap You Face]], by [[Joe Dolce]], became, and still remains, the most successful Australian produced original-song of all time. An example of Australians breaking free from convention came in [[TISM]]. Formed in 1982, the band is known for its anonymous members, outrageous stage antics, and humorous lyrics. In the words of the band, "There's only one factor left that makes us work. And that factor, I think, we've burned away, with the crucible of time, into something that's actually genuine."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/01/1088488079697.html |title=The phantom menace|work=[[The Age]]|author=Michael Dwyer|date=2 July 2004|accessdate=8 June 2008}}</ref>

[[Men at Work]], [[Divinyls]], and [[Hoodoo Gurus]], all formed between 1979 and 1981, would go on to be hugely successful worldwide. Men at Work's "[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]" hit number one in Australia, Europe, the UK, Canada, and the United States, and was considered the [[theme song]] of Australia's successful showing at the [[1983 America's Cup]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=Ann|author2=Linsay Knight |author3=Margaret McPhee  |title=The Dictionary of Performing Arts in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELACebeQEgcC&pg=PA156-IA11&dq=&as_brr=3&sig=mopBwU1kageJU6Ej8ixBNTZdM3o |publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]]|page=156|isbn=1-86373-898-3|year=1996}}</ref> Hoodoo Gurus, meanwhile, hit it big on the US college circuit—all of their [[Hoodoo Gurus discography#Studio albums|1980s albums]] topped the [[Campus radio#United States|chart]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=Peter|author2=Jonathan Buckley|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haEfq-nKqjgC&pg=PA940&dq=&as_brr=3&a&sig=G3hMbvq56FvTmcJgeiX8Q9mMUbM#PPA780,M1 |publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|page=779|isbn=1-84353-105-4|year=2003}}</ref> At the same time, a number of Australian bands relocated to the U.K. and particularly London to further their artistic and commercial endeavours, among whom were [[The Moodists]], [[The Go-Betweens]], [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]], [[Laughing Clowns]], [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]], [[SPK (band)|SPK]], [[The Triffids]], and [[Peter Loveday|Tiny Town]].<ref>Stuart Coupe, for The Sun Herald, January 27, 1985</ref>

In the 1980s, numerous innovative Australian rock bands arose. These included [[Hunters & Collectors]], [[The Church (band)|The Church]], [[TISM]], [[Divinyls]], [[Hoodoo Gurus]], [[Mondo Rock]], the [[Sunnyboys]], [[Men at Work]], [[The Go-Betweens]], [[The Triffids]], [[Lime Spiders]], [[Big Pig]], [[The Celibate Rifles]], the [[Cosmic Psychos]] and the [[Hard-Ons]]. During this period a number of Australian bands began to reflect their urban environment in songs dealing with day-to-day experiences of inner-city life e.g. [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] & the Coloured Girls perhaps best exemplified in his songs  "[[From St Kilda to Kings Cross]]" and "Leaps & Bounds", [[John Kennedy's Love Gone Wrong]] in songs such us "King Street" and [[The Mexican Spitfires]] in tracks like "Sydney Town" and "Town Hall Steps." This decade also saw the rise of [[world music]] groups like [[Dead Can Dance]]; of special importance is [[Yothu Yindi]], who helped found the field of [[indigenous rock]]. Then soap star [[Kylie Minogue]] began her music career in the late 1980s and released "[[The Loco-Motion]]" which became the biggest selling single in Australia for the decade and quickly catapulted her to worldwide stardom. The first annual [[ARIA Music Awards]] were held in 1987. [[John Farnham]] and [[Crowded House]] were the most successful artists at the event.

Three performers are visible: an electric bass player, an electric guitarist, and a drummer behind a drumkit.|[[Cosmic Psychos]], one of several Australian bands which influenced and interacted with the Seattle grunge scene]]
Grunge is a subgenre of [[alternative rock]] and a [[subculture]] that emerged during the {{nowrap|mid-1980s}} in Australia and in the [[Pacific Northwest]] U.S. state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The early grunge movement in the US revolved around Seattle's independent record label [[Sub Pop]] and that region's [[underground music]] scene. By the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge bands appearing in California, then emerging in other parts of the United States and in Australia, building strong followings and signing major record deals. [[Mark Arm]], the vocalist for the Seattle band [[Green River (band)|Green River]]—and later [[Mudhoney]]—stated that the term had been used in [[Australia]] in the mid-1980s to describe bands such as [[King Snake Roost]], [[The Scientists]], Salamander Jim, and [[Beasts of Bourbon]].<ref>{{cite news |date=January 20, 2001 |title=No End in Sight: Mudhoney Is Alive and Well | last=True | first=Everett | authorlink=Everett True | work=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/no-end-in-sight/Content?oid=6267 |accessdate=September 11, 2009}}</ref> Arm used grunge as a descriptive term rather than a genre term, but it eventually came to describe the punk/metal hybrid sound of the Seattle music scene.<ref>[[Clinton Heylin|Heylin, Clinton]].

[[Alternative rock]] began to gain popularity midway through the 1990s, with [[grunge]] and [[Britpop]] styles especially popular, resulting in a new wave of Australian bands.

The [[Big Day Out]] festival has showcased Australian and international acts, with [[Big Day Out lineups by year|line-ups]] spanning multiple genres, with an alternative focus.

The history of jazz and related genres in Australia extends back into the 19th century. During the gold rush locally formed [[blackface]] (white actor-musicians in blackface) [[Minstrel show|minstrel troupes]] began to tour Australia, touring not only the capital cities but also many of the booming regional towns like [[Ballarat]] and [[Bendigo]]. Minstrel orchestra music featured improvisatory embellishment and polyrhythm in the (pre-classic) banjo playing and clever percussion breaks. Some genuine African-American minstrel and jubilee singing troupes toured from the 1870s. A more jazz-like form of minstrelsy reached Australia in the late 1890s in the form of improvisatory and [[syncopated]] [[coon song]] and [[cakewalk]] music, two early forms of [[ragtime]]. The next two decades brought ensemble, piano and vocal ragtime and leading (mostly white) American ragtime artists, including [[Ben Harney]], "Emperor of Ragtime" [[Gene Greene]] and pianist [[Charley Straight]]. Some of these visitors taught Australians how to 'rag' (improvise unsyncopated popular music into ragtime-style music).

By the mid-1920s, [[phonograph]] machines, increased contact with [[American popular music]] and visiting white American dance musicians had firmly established jazz (meaning jazz inflected modern dance and stage music) in Australia. The first recordings of jazz in Australia are Mastertouch piano rolls recorded in Sydney from around 1922 but jazz began to be recorded on disc by 1925, first in Melbourne and soon thereafter in Sydney. Soon after World War II, jazz in Australia diverged into two strands. One was based on the earlier collectively improvised called "dixieland" or traditional jazz. The other so-called modernist stream was based on big band swing, small band progressive swing, boogie woogie, and after WWII, the emerging new style of [[bebop]]. By the 1950s American bop, itself, was dividing into so-called 'cool' and 'hard' bop schools, the latter being more polyrhythmic and aggressive. This division reached Australia on a small scale by the end of the 1950s. From the mid-1950s [[rock and roll]] began to draw young audiences and social dancers away from jazz. British-style dixieland, called Trad, became popular in the early 1960s. Most modern players stuck with the 'cool' (often called West Coast) style, but some experimented with free jazz, modal jazz, experiment with 'Eastern' influences, art music and visual art concept, electronic and jazz-rock fusions.

The 1970s brought tertiary jazz education courses and continuing innovation and diversification in jazz which, by the late 1980s, included world music fusion and contemporary classical and jazz crossovers. From this time, the trend towards eclectic style fusions has continued with ensembles like The Catholics, Australian Art Orchestra, Tongue and Groove, [[Roger Dean (musician)|austraLYSIS]], Wanderlust, The Necks and many others. It is questionable whether the label jazz is elastic enough to continue to embrace the ever-widening range of improvisatory musics that are associated with the term jazz in Australia. However, mainstream modern jazz and dixieland still have the strongest following and patron still flock to hear famous mainstream artists who have been around for decades, such as One Night Stand players Dugald Shaw and Blair Jordan, reeds player [[Don Burrows]] and trumpeter [[James Morrison (jazz musician)|James Morrison]] and, sometimes, the famous pioneer of traditional jazz in Australia, [[Graeme Bell]]. A non-academic genre of jazz has also evolved with a harder "street edge" style. The Conglomerate, The Bamboos, Damage, Cookin on Three Burners, Black Money [[John McAll]] are examples of this.
