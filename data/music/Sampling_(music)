In [[music]], '''sampling''' is the reuse of a portion or '''sample''' of a [[sound recording]] in another recording. Samples may comprise rhythm, melody, speech, or other sounds, and are integrated using digital hardware ([[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]]) or software such as [[Digital audio workstation|digital audio workstations]].

A process similar to sampling originated in the 1940s with ''[[musique concrète]]'', experimental music created by splicing, manipulating and looping tape. The term ''sampling'' was coined by in the late 1970s by the creators of the [[Fairlight CMI]], an influential early sampler that became a staple of [[1980s pop music]]. The 1988 release of the first [[Akai MPC]], an affordable sampler with an intuitive interface, made sampling accessible to a wider audience and had a major influence on the development of electronic and hip hop music. 

Sampling is a foundation of [[hip hop music]], with producers sampling funk and soul records, particularly [[Drum break|drum breaks]], which could then be rapped over. Musicians have created albums assembled entirely from samples, such as DJ Shadow's 1996 album ''[[Endtroducing.....|Endtroducing]].'' The practice has influenced all genres of music and is particularly important to electronic music, hip hop and pop.

[[Legal issues surrounding music sampling|Sampling without permission can infringe copyright]]. The process of acquiring permission for a sample is known as '''clearance''', which can be a complex and costly process. Landmark legal cases, such as ''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.|Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc]]'' in 1991, changed how samples are used. As the court ruled that unlicensed sampling constitutes [[copyright infringement]], samples from well known sources are now often prohibitively expensive.

== Precursors ==
In the 1940s, [[Pierre Schaeffer]] developed ''[[musique concrète]]'', an experimental form of music created by recording sounds to tape, splicing them, and manipulating them to create [[Sound collage|sound collages]]. He created pieces using recordings of sounds including the human body, locomotives, and kitchen utensils.<ref name=":0" /> The method also involved the creation of [[Tape loop|tape loops]], splicing lengths of tape end to end, by which a sound could be played indefinitely.<ref name=":0" /> Schaeffer developed a tape recorder, the Phonogene, which played loops at twelve different pitches triggered by a keyboard.<ref name=":0" /> 

Composers including [[John Cage]], [[Edgard Varèse|Edgar Varèse]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Karheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Iannis Xenakis]] experimented with ''musique concrète,''<ref name=":0" /> and [[Bebe and Louis Barron]] used it to create the first totally electronic film soundtrack, for the 1956 science fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''. It was brought to a mainstream audience by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], which used these early sampling techniques to produce soundtracks for shows including ''[[Doctor Who]]''.<ref name=":0" />

In the 1960s, Jamaican [[Dub music|dub reggae]] producers such as [[King Tubby]] and [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] began using pre-recorded samples of [[reggae]] rhythms to produce [[riddim]] tracks, which were then [[Deejay|deejayed]] over.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goNpkxHhH48C&pg=PA55|title=Reggae Wisdom: Proverbs in Jamaican Music|publisher=Univ.

{{Main|Sampler (musical instrument)}}[[File:Fairlight CMI-IIx.jpg|thumb|The [[Fairlight CMI]], an influential early [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] released in 1979]]

The term ''sampling'' was coined by in the late 1970s by Kim Ryrie and [[Peter Vogel (computer designer)|Peter Vogel]] to describe a feature of their [[Fairlight CMI]] synthesizer.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/lost-art-sampling-part-1|title=The Lost Art Of Sampling: Part 1 {{!}}|website=www.soundonsound.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-12}}</ref> Designers of early samplers used the term to describe the technical process of the instruments, rather than to describe how users would use the feature.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x-faxiGMNWoC|title=Perfecting Sound Forever: The Story of Recorded Music|last=Milner|first=Greg|date=2011-11-03|publisher=Granta Publications|year=|isbn=9781847086051|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref> While developing the Fairlight, Vogel sampled around a second of a piano piece from a radio broadcast, and discovered that he could imitate a real piano by playing the sample back at different pitches. He recalled in 2005:

{{quote|It sounded remarkably like a piano, a real piano. This had never been done before ... By today's standards it was a pretty awful piano sound, but at the time it was a million times more like a piano than anything any synthesiser had churned out. So I rapidly realised that we didn't have to bother with all the synthesis stuff.

Compared to later samplers, the Fairlight offered limited control over samples; it allowed control over pitch and [[Envelope (music)|envelope]], and could only record a few seconds of sound. However, its ability to sample and play back acoustic sounds became its most popular feature.<ref name=":0" /> Though the concept of reusing recordings in larger recordings was not new, the Fairlight's built-in sequencer and design made the process simple.<ref name=":0" /> According to the ''Guardian,'' the Fairlight was the "first truly world-changing sampler".<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/28/whats-that-sound-sampler|title=Hey, what's that sound: Sampler|last=McNamee|first=David|date=2009-09-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}</ref> Though it was it was unaffordable for most hobbyists, early users included [[Kate Bush]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Thomas Dolby]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]] and [[Ebn Ozn]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.musicradar.com/tuition/tech/a-brief-history-of-sampling-604868|title=A brief history of sampling|work=MusicRadar|access-date=2018-10-12|language=EN-GB}}</ref>

The success of the Fairlight inspired competitors to produce their own samplers, improving the technology and driving down prices dramatically.<ref name=":0" /> Early competitors included the [[E-mu Emulator]]<ref name=":0" /> and the Akai S950.<ref name=":2" /> [[Drum machine|Drum machines]] such as the [[Oberheim DMX]] and [[Linn LM-1]] began incorporating samples of drum kits rather than generating sounds from circuits.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/22/linn-oberheim-drum-machines|title=Hey, what's that sound: Linn LM-1 Drum Computer and the Oberheim DMX|last=McNamee|first=David|date=2009-06-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> 

The designers of early samplers anticipated that users would sample short sounds, such as drum hits or individual notes played on a flute, to use as "building blocks" for compositions. However, musicians and producers began sampling longer passages of music.<ref name=":12" /> In the words of Greg Milner, author of ''Perfecting Sound Forever'', "They didn't just want the sound of [[John Bonham|John Bonham's]] kick drum, they wanted to loop and repeat the whole of '[[When the Levee Breaks]]'."<ref name=":12" /> [[Roger Linn]], designer of the LM-1 and MPC, said: "It was a very pleasant surprise. After sixty years of recording, there are so many prerecorded examples to sample from. Why reinvent the wheel?"<ref name=":12" /> 

In response to demand, samplers such as E-mu's [[E-mu SP-1200|SP-1200]] were developed to allow users to store longer samples.<ref name=":12" /> In 1988, Akai released the first [[Akai MPC|MPC]] sampler,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/the-10-most-important-hardware-samplers-in-history-361471|title=The 10 most important hardware samplers in history|work=MusicRadar|access-date=2018-05-13|language=EN-GB}}</ref> which allowed artists to assign samples to separate pads and trigger them independently, similarly to playing a keyboard or drum kit.<ref name=":03">{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/16/16615352/akai-mpc-music-history-impact|title=Meet the unassuming drum machine that changed music forever|work=Vox|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref> It had a major influence on the development of electronic and hip hop music,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/22/akai-mpc-live-mpc-x/|title=Hip-hop's most influential sampler gets a 2017 reboot|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":03" /> allowing artists to create elaborate tracks without other instruments, a studio, or formal music knowledge.<ref name=":04">{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/16/16615352/akai-mpc-music-history-impact|title=Meet the unassuming drum machine that changed music forever|work=Vox|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref> Today, most samples are made and edited using [[Digital audio workstation|digital audio workstations]] such as [[Pro Tools]] and [[Ableton Live]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/feb/16/whendidsamplingbecamesono|title=When did sampling become so non-threatening?|last=McNamee|first=David|date=2008-02-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}</ref><ref name=":12" />

Some samples became widespread, such as the [[orchestra hit]], which originated as a sound on the Fairlight sampled from [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky's]] 1910 orchestral work ''[[Firebird Suite]]''<ref name="Fink 2005 1">{{harvtxt|Fink|2005|p=1}}</ref> and became a hip hop [[Cliché|cliche]].<ref name="Fink 2005 6">{{harvtxt|Fink|2005|p=6}}</ref> According to the [[BBC]], the most sampled track of all time is "[[Change the Beat]]" by [[Fab Five Freddy]], which appears on over 1,150 tracks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/worlds-most-sampled-song-change-beat-fab-5-freddy-180949863/#JpXuDHHbpIOGUg7i.99|title=The World’s Most Sampled Song Is "Change the Beat" by Fab 5 Freddy|last=Eveleth|first=Rose|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en}}</ref> Another common sample comes from a seven-second drum break in the 1969 track "Amen, Brother", known as the [[Amen break]], which became popular first with American hip hop producers and then British [[Jungle music|jungle]] producers in the early 1990s.<ref name=":9" /> The sample became widely used across genres, used by rock bands such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and in television theme tunes such as that of ''[[Futurama]]''.<ref name=":9" />

In 2008, ''Guardian'' journalist David McNamee wrote that in the 1980s sampling had been a political act, but had lost its edge with ubiquity: "Two record decks and your dad's old funk collection was once the working-class black answer to [[Punk rock|punk]] ... Sampling, which once seemed world-ending in the eyes of the music industry, is now non-threatening and a bit passé, particularly with today's availability and ease of original music-making software."<ref name=":4" />

== Legal and ethical issues ==
{{Main|Legal issues surrounding music sampling}}
Sampling without permission [[Copyright infringement|breaches the copyright]] of the original sound recording, of the composition and lyrics, and of the performances, such as a guitar riff or rhythm. The [[moral rights]] of the original artist may also be breached if they are not credited or object to the sampling.<ref name=":7" /> In some cases, sampling may be protected under American [[fair use]] laws.<ref name=":7" /> The process of acquiring legal permission for a sample is known as clearance, which can be a lengthy and complex process.<ref name=":7" />

[[Richard Lewis Spencer]], who owns the copyright for the widely sampled [[amen break]], has never received royalties for its use and condemned its sampling as "plagiarism" and "bullshit". He likened the situation to "the man who goes to the sperm bank and unknowingly sires hundreds of children".<ref name=":9" /> In 1989, the [[The Turtles|Turtles]] sued [[De La Soul]] for using an uncleared sample on their album ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]].'' Turtles singer [[Mark Volman]] told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': "Sampling is just a longer term for theft. Anybody who can honesty say sampling is some sort of creativity has never done anything creative."<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-lists/songs-on-trial-12-landmark-music-copyright-cases-166396/de-la-soul-vs-the-turtles-1991-61686/|title=Songs on Trial: 12 Landmark Music Copyright Cases|last=Runtagh|first=Jordan|date=2016-06-08|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}</ref> The case was settled out of court and set a [[legal precedent]] that had a [[chilling effect]] on sampling in hip hop.<ref name=":3" />[[File:Biz Markie 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Biz Markie]] (pictured in 2016) ]]In 1991, songwriter [[Gilbert O'Sullivan]] sued rapper [[Biz Markie]] after he sampled O'Sullivan's "Alone Again (Naturally)" on his album ''[[I Need a Haircut]]'' (see ''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.]])''. The court ruled that sampling without permission constituted [[copyright infringement]]. Instead of asking for [[Royalty payment|royalties]], O'Sullivan forced Biz Markie's label [[Warner Bros.

Following the ruling, samples on commercially released recordings have typically been taken either from obscure recordings (such as on ''Endtroducing)'' or cleared, an often expensive option only available to successful acts.<ref name=":5" /> According to the ''Guardian'', "Sampling became risky business and a rich man's game, with record labels regularly checking if their musical property had been tea-leafed."<ref name=":4" /> For less successful artists, the legal implications for samples can create confusion. According to ''Fact'', "For a bedroom producer, clearing a sample can be nearly impossible, both financially and in terms of administration."<ref name=":8" /> The 1989 [[Beastie Boys]] record [[Paul's Boutique|''Paul's Boutique'']] is composed almost entirely of samples, most of which were cleared "easily and affordably"; the clearance process would be much more expensive today.<ref name="samples">{{cite journal|last=Tingen|first=Paul|date=May 2005|title=The Dust Brothers: Sampling, Remixing & The Boat Studio|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may05/articles/dust.htm|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=SOS Publications Group|issn=1473-5326|accessdate=July 25, 2011|magazine=[[Sound on Sound]]}}</ref>

The ''Washington Post'' described the modern use of well known samples, such as those by [[Kanye West]], as a way of advertising wealth, similarly to flaunting cars or jewellery.<ref name=":5" /> West has been sued several times over his use of samples.<ref name=":8" /> Though some have accused the law of restricting creativity, others argue it forces producers to innovate.<ref name=":5" /> Sampling can help popularize the sampled work; for example, the [[Desiigner]] track "[[Panda (Desiigner song)|Panda]]" topped the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Hot]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|100]] after West sampled it on "[[Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 2]]".<ref name=":8" />

According to ''Fact'', early hip hop sampling was governed by an "unspoken" set of rules, forbidding sampling records released less than ten years earlier, reissues, other hip hop records, or from non-[[Phonograph record|vinyl]] sources, among other restrictions.<ref name=":6" /> These rules were relaxed as younger producers took over: "For many producers today it is no longer a case of 'should I sample this?' but of 'can I get away with sampling this?'. Thus the ethics of sampling unravelled as the practice became ever more ubiquitous."<ref name=":6" />

To circumvent legal problems, producers may recreate a portion of a recording rather than sample it. This requires only the publisher's permission, and allows artists to break the portion into its constituent components ''–'' for example, by separating the guitar and drum tracks ''–'' allowing for more creative possibilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/steve-gibson-dave-walters-recreating-samples|title=Steve Gibson & Dave Walters: Recreating Samples {{!}}|website=www.soundonsound.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref>
