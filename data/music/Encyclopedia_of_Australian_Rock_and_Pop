==Reviews==
Publishers, [[Allen & Unwin]] describe McFarlane's encyclopedia as containing over 870 entries and is an "essential reference to the bands and artists who molded the shape of Australian popular music [...] in an A-to-Z encyclopedia format complete with biographical and historical details. Each entry also includes listings of original band lineups and subsequent changes, record releases, career highlights, and cross-references with related bands and artists."<ref name="BarnesNoble">{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-encyclopedia-of-australian-rock-and-pop-ian-mcfarlane/1003839952?ean=9781865080727|title=The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop, Ian McFarlane, Book|publisher=Barnes & Noble|accessdate=31 May 2009}}</ref>

United States [[Barnes & Noble]] reviewer, David Turkalo, found that although it was written solidly and had "a surprising number of [[Australian-American]] connections", it was too specialised for general American library patrons.<ref name="BarnesNoble2">{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-encyclopedia-of-australian-rock-and-pop-ian-mcfarlane/1003839952?ean=9781865080727|title=The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop, Ian McFarlane, Book|last=Turkalo|first=David M.|publisher=Barnes & Noble|accessdate=31 May 2009}}</ref>

The book has a similar title to the 1978 work by [[Noel McGrath (author)|Noel McGrath]], ''[[Australian Encyclopaedia of Rock and Pop]]''.<ref name="McGrath">{{cite book|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.cat-vn2600148|title=Noel McGrath's Australian encyclopaedia of rock & pop / Noel McGrath|publisher=National Library of Australia|isbn=0-7270-1909-0|accessdate=31 May 2009}}</ref>

The second edition appeared in 2017 and was updated to 2016. Steven Carroll of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' opined that "Any survey of Australian pop and rock that includes entries on such bands as Serious Young Insects (via Boom Crash Opera) is a serious tome. It's so easy to get lost in this revised edition: one band leading to another, and so on, until you're suddenly asking yourself what happened to the last hour."<ref name="Carroll">{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-encyclopedia-of-australian-rock-and-pop-review-a-glorious-journey-20170311-guvxg1.html | title = ''The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop'' review: a glorious journey | last = Carroll | first = Steven | date = 17 March 2017 | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 5 June 2017 }}</ref>
