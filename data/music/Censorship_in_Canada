{{Censorship by country}}

In [[Canada]], appeals by the judiciary to [[community standards]] and the [[public interest]] are the ultimate determinants of which forms of expression may legally be published, broadcast, or otherwise publicly disseminated.<ref>[http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/CIR/8416-e.htm "Charter of Rights and Freedoms: Fundamental Freedoms"], Kristen Douglas and Mollie Dunsmuir, ''Current Issue Reviews'' 84-16E, 1998, Library of Parliament, Parliamentary Research Branch, Law and Government Division, Canada, ss. 2(d)-(e).</ref> Other public organisations with the authority to censor include some tribunals and courts under provincial human rights laws, and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], along with self-policing associations of private corporations such as the [[Canadian Association of Broadcasters]] and the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]].

Over the 20th century, legal standards for '''censorship in Canada''' shifted from a "strong state-centred practice", intended to protect the community from perceived social degradation, to a more decentralised form of censorship often instigated by societal groups invoking state support to restrict the public [[free speech|expression]] of political and ideological opponents.<ref name="inter">[https://books.google.com/books/about/Interpreting_Censorship_in_Canada.html?id=O7tFPZ33_NcC ''Interpreting Censorship in Canada''], Klaus Petersen and Allen C.

===Corridart===
The demolition of the [[Corridart]] exhibit in [[Montreal]] by former mayor [[Jean Drapeau]] on the 13 June 1976, two days before the commencement of the [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal Olympic Games]], was considered an act of censorship by the artists involved and resulted in a lengthy court trial wherein the artistic and aesthetic merit of the project was questioned. The collaborative efforts of a significant portion of the Montreal arts community was ordered destroyed by the mayor and was done so by municipal workers with police escort. The 16 main installations and dozens of smaller installations were taken to a municipal impound lot, in some cases left outside to be destroyed by the elements. The actions of the mayor were condemned by the provincial cultural affairs minister, principally because the mayor lacked legal authority over the Olympics as a whole. Corridart was intended to showcase Canadian and Montreal arts to an international audience.

Within the traditional [[Thirty-two forms of Ganesha]] in Hinduism, Ganesha is sometimes presented nude, in both infant ([[Bala Ganapati]]) and erotic ([[Uchchhishta Ganapati]]) forms. Simons concludes, "In his haste to appease a few protesters, the mayor, usually a champion of the arts, made a serious error in judgment. Instead of giving McCourt's divinely inspired statues the bum's rush, we should be celebrating this Canadian cross-pollination of cultures and aesthetic forms".<ref name="sac" /> ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''{{'}}s columnist [[Margaret Wente]] agreed with Simons: "The mayor, of course, was quite wrong.

Despite such negative responses in the media to visual art censorship in Canada, in 2014 the Edmonton Arts Council subsequently refused a donation of one of McCourt's sculptures, ''Destroyer of Obstacles'',evidently because the sculpture had genitalia "beneath its clothes".<ref>[http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2015/04/24/reaching-for-a-reasonable-justification-for-censorship/ PZ Myers, "Reaching For a Reasonable Justification for Censorship," Pharyngula, April 24, 2015]</ref> After meeting with seven Hindu community group representative to seek out their opinion of the donation, the Edmonton Arts Council received a response that McCourt's sculpture was "an offense to their religion" and that the ban enacted by Mayor Mandel should remain in place.<ref>[http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=5abab0a9c9b37e16ccd9e973c&id=7a39732458 Edmonton Arts Council - Briefing Note, June 12, 2014]</ref> As a result of this consultation, "the Public Art Committee unanimously voted to decline acceptance of the gift, as the artwork did not meet "community or civic suitability" criteria." In McCourt's view, "It is not the purpose of a city’s public art collection to placate special interests," he says. "I want Edmonton to build the best civic art collection that we can get, never mind the politics, the religion, etc. of the artists making the work."<ref>[http://www.curiousarts.ca/the-pleasures-and-perils-of-public-art Donna McKinnon, "The Pleasures and Perils of Public Art," Curious Arts, November 27, 2015]</ref>

==Broadcasting==
The main body monitoring and regulating broadcast content in Canada is the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]], a self-governing association of radio and television broadcasters. The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), while also having the power to regulate broadcast content, intervenes only in the most serious and controversial cases.

Many Canadian broadcast stations broadcast explicit programming under certain circumstances, albeit with viewer discretion advisories and at adult-oriented times on the schedule. [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], for example, has aired controversial series such as ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' and ''[[The Osbournes]]'' in [[prime time]] without editing, and some Canadian television broadcasters, such as [[CITY-TV|Citytv]], in the 1970s, aired softcore [[pornography]] after 12 midnight [[Eastern time zone|EST]], which can therefore be viewed as early as 9:00&nbsp;p.m. in other parts of Canada (i.e., anywhere in the [[Pacific Time Zone]]).

The Code of Ethics of the [[Canadian Association of Broadcasters]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cab-acr.ca/english/social/codes/ethics.shtm|accessdate=February 17, 2007|title= Canadian Association of Broadcasters' Code of Ethics|publisher=Canadian Broadcast Standards Council|date=June 2002}}</ref> defines the "late viewing period" as the hours from 9:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m. Outside this period, the Code of Ethics prohibits programming containing sexually explicit material or coarse or offensive language. This association also publishes a "Voluntary Code Regarding Violence in Television Programming".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cab-acr.ca/english/social/antiviolence/violencecode.shtm|accessdate=February 27, 2007|title=Voluntary Code Regarding Violence in Television Programming|publisher=Canadian Association of Broadcasters}}</ref>

In enforcing these two Codes, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council permits nudity to be broadcast during the day as long as it is considered non-sexual. For example, the CBSC permitted a 4:00&nbsp;p.m. broadcast of the movie ''[[Wildcats (film)|Wildcats]]'' containing male frontal nudity in a locker-room scene and female nudity in a bathtub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/decisions/20-0001/20-0001-0964_PD_E.pdf |title=CBSC Decision &#124; WTN re the movie Wildcats |publisher=Canadian Broadcast Standards Council|date=January 16, 2002 |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref> The CBSC has also permitted the film ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'', which contains scenes of bare female breasts, to be shown at 8:00&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2000/000531.php |title=CBSC Decision &#124; TQS re the movie Strip Tease |publisher=Canadian Broadcast Standards Council |date=February 21, 2000 |accessdate=December 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027191316/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2000/000531.php |archivedate=October 27, 2011 |df= }}</ref>

The CBSC summarizes its policy on sexual activity as follows:

{{quote|Before the [[Watershed (television)|Watershed]] (9:00 pm - 6:00 am), the CBSC considers that it is inappropriate to show sexual activity that is intended for adult eyes and minds.  There is, in the pre-Watershed period, a run of 15 hours (a strong majority of the broadcast day and about 90% of our customary waking hours), during which broadcasters offer their audiences a "safe haven", namely, a period in which their television viewing can be free of adult-oriented material, whether sexual or otherwise.  There may still, in that time frame, be programming that some parents will not wish their families to see (all adults should make the effort to weigh the appropriateness of all kinds of programming for themselves and their children) but it will not be due to its exclusively adult orientation.  And even in the pre-Watershed period, broadcasters advise their audiences of the nature of what is to come.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/060411.php |title=CBSC Decision &#124; Global re ReGenesis ("Baby Bomb") |publisher=Canadian Broadcast Standards Council |date=January 20, 2006 |accessdate=December 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027173659/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/060411.php |archivedate=October 27, 2011 |df= }}</ref>}}

==Film==
In the early 1910s, motion pictures were rising in popularity. It was decided nationally that censorship of them was necessary in order to be suitable for a wide, general audience of varying ages, mental, and educational levels. However, since national censorship for such a large and diverse country was unworkable, each province would censor according to their own provincial community standards. However, Ontario would be the "main" censor in that theatrical prints would be censored/edited by the Ontario censors then distributed throughout Ontario and the other provinces. The other provinces would provide additional censorship/editing if it was necessary for their own province. The Ontario board was formed in 1911; other provinces followed shortly thereafter. [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] never formed any boards but instead took their advice from the [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] boards.<ref name=Dean1981>{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Malcolm|title=Censored!

The censors had no strict rules however; they often took advice from the [[British Board of Film Censors]] in the early years. In the 1920s, the Ontario censor board objected to content such as:<ref name=Dean1981/><ref name=Take30>''[[Take 30]]'', October 11, 1968, [[CBC Television]] ([http://www.cbc.ca/archives/discover/programs/t/take-30/censored.html digitized episode])</ref>
* actors pointing guns directly at the camera, or at other actors due to the possible negative effects on children and mentally weaker individuals
* machine guns
* scenes with women smoking
* profanity, vulgarity, and obscenity
* disrespect for officers of the law
* depiction and patriotic waving of the American flag, this was so the boards could promote a sense of Canadian nationalism
* illicit sexual relations
* nudity
* cruelty to animals
* drinking
* drug use

In the 1920s, the Canadian film boards removed American patriotism from imported films, citing their damage to a pro-British sentiment.<ref name="inter"/>

Eventually, six of the provincial censor boards adopted classification in 1953 though films were still censored for certain categories. The idea of classification was first proposed by Ottawa child welfare advocate, and future mayor, [[Charlotte Whitton]] in 1920; however, at the time it was criticized with one newspaper editor claiming "A film that's not suitable for a ten-year-old should not be seen at all."<ref name="Take30"/> It was in the 1950s that the censorship standards became more permissive. For example, ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' contained an intense birth scene, a character yells "Damn!" in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', and ''[[Peyton Place (film)|Peyton Place]]'' contained "pungent language". All of which was passed, in Ontario at least.<ref name=Dean1981/>

In the 1960s, Manitoba became the first province to fully adopt classification and abandon censorship.

Most Canadian provinces still have ratings boards that have the power to order cuts to movies and may even ban the showing of films if they violate Canada's Criminal Code sanctions against depicting sexualized violence and sex acts involving people under the age of 18. [[List of films banned in Canada|Movies formerly banned in some Canadian provinces]] include ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and ''[[Pretty Baby (film)|Pretty Baby]]''.

One particularly famous censorship controversy involved the award-winning German film ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'', which was banned as pornographic by Ontario's film review board in 1980.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/2004/200404/20040419.html | title=CBC Radio – The Current – Whole Show Blow-by-Blow|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040807111304/http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/2004/200404/20040419.html|archivedate=2004-08-07}}</ref>

The [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Young People Fucking]]'' prompted the [[Government of Canada]] to introduce [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] [[Income Tax Amendments Act, 2006|C-10]], to allow revoking government funds from films the government deemed offensive. Strong public backlash led to the bill dying on the [[order paper]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0913445/trivia YPF (2007) Trivia], Internet Movie Database, retrieved February 26, 2013</ref>

==Print==
In 1937, under [[Maurice Duplessis]], [[Quebec]]'s [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] government passed the ''Act to protect the Province Against Communistic Propaganda'' (commonly known as the "[[Padlock Law]]"), which banned the printing, publishing or distributing of "any newspaper, periodical, pamphlet, circular, document or writing, propagating Communism or Bolshevism". The law was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in [[Switzman v. Elbling]] in 1957.

In 1949, spearheaded by the campaigning of MP [[Davie Fulton]], [[crime comics]] were banned in Canada in Bill 10 of the [[21st Canadian Parliament]]'s 1st session (informally known as the [[Fulton Bill]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/comics/027002-8400-e.html |title=ARCHIVED - Crackdown on Comics, 1947-1966 - Comic Books in English Canada - Beyond The Funnies |publisher=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2018-04-22}}</ref> {{as of|2013}}, crime comics are still illegal under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].<ref>[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-86.html#h-58 Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 163(1)(b), (7).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006142924/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-86.html#h-58 |date=October 6, 2015 }}</ref>

===''Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v Canada''===
One of the most famous ongoing censorship controversies in Canada has been the dispute between [[Canada Border Services Agency|Canada Customs]] and [[LGBT]] retail bookstores such as [[Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium|Little Sister's]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] and [[Glad Day Bookshop|Glad Day]] in [[Toronto]]. Through the 1980s and into the 1990s, Canada Customs frequently stopped material being shipped to the two stores on the grounds of "obscenity". Both stores frequently had to resort to the legal system to challenge the confiscation of their property.

In 2000, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] [[Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice)|ruled]] that Canada Customs did not have the authority to make its own judgments about the permissibility of material being shipped to the stores but was permitted to confiscate only material that had specifically been ruled by the courts to constitute an offence under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].
{{Main| Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v Canada}}

In addition a report from 2013, reports that over 100 books, magazine, and other written works were challenged for removal in schools and libraries. Some of these challenges were upheld; however, some were rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtoread.ca/censorship-in-canada/challenged-works-list/#.Vw6eStUrLnA|title=Challenged Works List|website=www.freedomtoread.ca|access-date=2016-04-13}}</ref>

==Internet==
Internet content is not specifically regulated in Canada, however local laws apply to websites hosted in Canada as well as to residents who host sites on servers in other jurisdictions. A well-known example is the case of [[Ernst Zündel]], who was investigated by the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]] for promoting ethnic hatred via his website.

In November 2006, Canadian Internet service providers [[Bell Canada|Bell]], [[Bell Aliant]], [[MTS Allstream]], [[Rogers Communications|Rogers]], [[Shaw Communications|Shaw]], [[SaskTel]], [[Telus]], and [[Vidéotron]] announced Project [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]] Canada, a voluntary effort to block websites hosting [[child pornography]]. The list of blocked sites is compiled from reports by Internet users and investigated by the independent organization [[Cybertip.ca]]. Project Cleanfeed was praised following its founding by [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] Supt. Earla-Kim McColl (then-head of the National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2006/11/23/porn-blocked.html |title=Mountie hopes web initiative could cut child abuse |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=November 23, 2006 |accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref>

In October 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] unanimously ruled that online publications cannot be found liable for linking to [[defamatory]] material as long as the linking itself is not defamatory.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/10/19/pol-scoc-hyperlink.html "Internet links not libel, top court rules"], Meagan Fitzpatrick, ''CBC News'', October 19, 2011</ref>

In 2015, the province of [[Quebec]] proposed legislation which would require unlicensed [[online gambling]] websites, as defined by [[Loto-Québec]], to be blocked by ISPs in defense of the Loto-Québec-operated Espacejeux. The proposal was criticized for the possible precedents that such legislation could set, as it would be the first [[internet censorship]] law passed by a Canadian government, as well as the law's intent to maintain a monopoly.<ref name="gandm-quebecblock">{{cite news|title=Quebec plan to block gambling sites draws cries of censorship|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/quebec-plan-to-block-gambling-sites-draws-cries-of-censorship/article27259448/|accessdate=19 March 2016|work=The Globe and Mail}}</ref><ref name="gandm-blocking">{{cite news|title=Quebec plans to order ISPs to block unlicensed gambling sites|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/quebec-plans-to-order-isps-to-block-illegal-gambling-sites/article23657414/|accessdate=22 March 2016|work=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> Bill 74 was passed by the provincial government in May 2016. It was challenged in the Quebec Superior Court by the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association, and by the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in a complaint to the CRTC. In December 2016, the Commission decided that it would await the outcome of the court case before making a final ruling, but iterated its opinion that under the [[Telecommunications Act (Canada)|Telecommunications Act]], no ISP may censor websites without its consent, and that "compliance with other legal or juridical requirements – whether municipal, provincial, or foreign – does not in and of itself justify the blocking of specific websites by Canadian carriers, in the absence of commission approval".<ref name="fp-crtcquebecblock">{{cite web|title=CRTC says it holds power over website blocking in Quebec gambling case|url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/crtc-says-it-can-force-quebec-to-unblock-gambling-websites?__lsa=3628-e628|website=Financial Post|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> In July 2018, the law was struck down by the Quebec Superior Court, citing these matters as being responsibility of the federal government and the notion of [[net neutrality]] enforced by the CRTC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/court-rejects-quebec-s-bid-to-ban-citizens-access-to-private-online-gaming-sites-1.4025619|title=Court rejects Quebec's bid to ban citizens' access to private online gaming sites|last=Valiante|first=Giuseppe|date=2018-07-24|work=CTV News|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en-CA}}</ref>

On January 28, 2018, FairPlay Canada, an industry coalition formed by major Canadian media companies, proposed to the CRTC the formation of a mandatory system to block websites "blatantly" involved in [[copyright infringement]]. The system would utilize an independent organization to submit blocklists to the CRTC for approval; there would be no judicial oversight, and the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] could only intervene after the fact. The group argued that illegal streaming of copyrighted media was harming the businesses of themselves and content producers, and that [[Fully-loaded set-top box|streaming boxes]] had eased such access. The proposal has been widely criticized for the possibility of abuse; [[Michael Geist]] described the proposal as being "ill-advised and dangerous", citing criticisms surrounding other site-blocking systems, the lack of judicial oversight, concerns that accidental overblocking could violate the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and statistics showing that Canada was below global averages for unauthorized music distribution, and had more [[Netflix]] subscribers per-capita than countries with site blocking rules in effect.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/why-the-crtc-should-reject-fairplays-dangerous-website-blocking-plan/article37818403/|title=Why the CRTC should reject FairPlay’s dangerous website-blocking plan|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fairplay-piracy-website-blocking-crtc-1.4539566|title='Slippery slope': Opposition mounts to Canadian media's plan to block piracy websites|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/anti-piracy-group-under-fire-for-website-blocking-proposal/article37856303/|title=Anti-piracy group under fire for website-blocking proposal|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> The proposal was struck down by the CRTC, as copyright law is outside of its jurisdiction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/media/crtc-rejects-call-to-block-content-pirates-in-setback-for-bell-rogers-cbc-coalition|title=CRTC rejects call to block content pirates in setback for Bell, Rogers, CBC coalition|date=2018-10-02|work=Financial Post|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Private sector employees==
Canadians can be disciplined by their employers for writing letters to newspapers. [[Christine St-Pierre]], a television reporter covering federal politics for [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], was suspended in September 2006 for writing a letter in support of Canadian troops in Afghanistan.<ref>Dany Bouchard. [http://www.canoe.com/divertissement/tele-medias/nouvelles/2006/09/08/1814426-jdm.html Christine Saint-Pierre chassée d'Ottawa] {{fr icon}}, ''[[Le Journal de Montréal]]'', Sept. 08, 2006</ref>

[[Chris Kempling]], a Canadian educator and counsellor, was suspended by the British Columbia College of Teachers and disciplined by the Quesnel School District for anti-gay comments in letters to the editor of the Quesnel Cariboo Observer.

Canadian courts have upheld professional sanctions against teachers and school counsellors for writing letters to newspapers that are found to be discriminatory, limiting their [[freedom of expression]] and [[religious freedom|religion]] on the basis of maintaining "a school system that is free from bias, prejudice and intolerance."<ref>[http://scc.lexum.org/decisia-scc-csc/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1367/index.do "Ross v. New Brunswick School District No. 15"], [1996] 1 S.C.R. 825. ''Judgements of the Supreme Court of Canada''.</ref>  See [[Status of religious freedom in Canada]]''

==Public servants==
Canadian public sector employees can be dismissed for criticizing the government, if the criticism reaches the point of impairing the public employee's ability to perform their functions. The requirement of the non-partisan federal public service is an important factor to take into account.  For example, in ''Fraser v. Public Sector Staff Relations Board'', the Supreme Court of Canada stated:

<blockquote>When one examines the substance of the criticisms (two major government policies and the character and integrity of the Prime Minister and Government), the context of those criticisms (prolonged, virtually full time, in public meetings, on radio, on television, in newspapers, local, national, international), and the form of the criticisms (initially restrained, but increasingly vitriolic and vituperative) the Adjudicator's conclusion that Mr. Fraser's ability to perform his own job and his suitability to remain in the public service were both impaired was a fair conclusion. Though no direct evidence of the fact of impairment of capacity is required, here the evidence clearly established circumstances from which the inference of impairment is clearly irresistible. Put simply, although there is not an absolute prohibition against public servants criticizing government policies, Mr. Fraser in this case went much too far.<ref>[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/96/index.do ''Fraser v. PSSRB'', [1985<nowiki>]</nowiki> 2 SCR 455, para. 50]</ref></blockquote>

Employees who are disciplined have the right to have the discipline reviewed through workplace arbitration, which in fact was offered to Fraser, but he declined:

<blockquote>There was a disagreement there. The employee wanted to speak out. The employer said that he could not. The employee persisted. The employer suspended him. But that is not all the employer did. The employer recognized that the employee was taking a principled stand. Accordingly, the employer offered to expedite the grievance procedure, provided the employee would cease his criticism. The employee refused. He decided to continue, and in fact greatly expanded, his criticism of the Government. In doing this, it seems to me, he voluntarily assumed the risk that his conduct might be adjudged to be sufficient cause for the initial suspension or for subsequent disciplinary action.<ref>''Fraser v PSSRB'', para. 52.</ref></blockquote>

The [[Canadian Human Rights Act]] formerly prohibited hate messages in telecommunications under federal jurisdiction, such as broadcasting and the internet.  Section 13 of the Act prohibited making a statement by telecommunication which "is likely to expose a person or persons to 'hatred or contempt' by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination." Those prohibited grounds of discrimination are on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.<ref>[http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/legislation_policies/section13_article13-eng.aspx Section 13(1), ''Canadian Human Rights Act'' (CHRA)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307000217/http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/legislation_policies/section13_article13-eng.aspx |date=March 7, 2013 }}, 1977, Canadian Human Rights Commission, Retrieved February 26, 2013</ref>    Provinces such as British Columbia and Alberta have extended this prohibition to all publications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://canlii.ca/t/jj1b |title=Human Rights Code, RSBC 1996, c 210 |work=BC Laws |publisher=Canadian Legal Information Institute |date=January 1, 2008 |accessdate=December 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130407134440/http://canlii.ca/t/jj1b |archivedate=April 7, 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertahumanrights.ab.ca/other/statements/what_to_know/section_3.asp |title=Section 3:  Discrimination re publications, notices |work=Alberta Human rights Act (Chapter A-25.5, Revised Statutes of Alberta 2000) |publisher=Alberta Queen's Printer |date=March 10, 2010 |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref>  In 1990, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.<ref>''Canada (Human Rights Commission) v.

In the mid-2000s, there was a series of high-profile cases involving s. 13, and the related provincial provisions.  For example, [[Marc Lemire]] and [[Paul Fromm (activist)|Paul Fromm]] challenged the constitutionality of s. 13.  In September 2009 the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] ruled that s. 13 violated Canadians' charter rights to freedom of expression.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/hate-speech-law-violates-charter-rights-tribunal-rules/article1273956/ "Hate-speech law violates Charter rights, tribunal rules "], Susan Krashinsky, ''The Globe and Mail'', 2 September 2009.</ref>  However, that ruling was overturned on appeal by the [[Federal Court of Appeal]], which found that s. 13 continued to be constitutionally valid.<ref>[https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/court-finds-internet-hate-speech-law-section-13-to-be-constitutionally-valid-doesnt-violate-freedom-of-expression Joseph Brean, "Court finds Internet hate law Section 13 to be constitutionally valid, doesn't violate freedom of expression", ''National Post'', February 2, 2014.]</ref>

In 2008 the [[Alberta Human Rights Commission]] held hearings on a complaint against former publisher [[Ezra Levant]] after the ''[[Western Standard]]'' published the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons]] depicting [[Muhammad]]. The complaint was ultimately withdrawn,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080215.wcomment0215/BNStory/National/home|title=Why I'm withdrawing my human rights complaint against Ezra Levant|first=Syed |last=Soharwardy |work=The Globe and Mail |date=February 15, 2008}}</ref>
and a complaint filed with [[Calgary]] police came to naught. An identical complaint by the Edmonton Muslim Council was dismissed by the Alberta Commission in August 2008.

In 2008, three complaints were filed in three different jurisdictions against [[Mark Steyn]] and ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine for publishing excerpts from Steyn's book, [[America Alone]], which the complainants said were offensive to Muslims.  All three complaints were dismissed:  the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]] declared it lacked jurisdiction;<ref>[http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/news_centre/commission-statement-concerning-issues-raised-complaints-against-macleans-magazine "Commission statement concerning issues raised by complaints against Maclean's Magazine], Ontario Human rights Commission, 9 April 2008.</ref> the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]] dismissed the complaint;<ref>Macdonald, Neil.

The Steyn / Maclean's case has been cited as a motivating factor in the June 2013 repeal of s. 13 of the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]].<ref>[http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/06/07/jonathan-kay-good-riddance-to-section-13-of-the-canadian-human-rights-act/ "Good riddance to Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act"] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130105111536/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/06/07/jonathan-kay-good-riddance-to-section-13-of-the-canadian-human-rights-act/# |date=2013-01-05 }}, Jonathan Kay, ''National Post'', 7 June 2012.</ref>  In 2011, [[Keith Martin (politician)|Keith Martin]], a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] Member of Parliament from British Columbia, introduced a motion that called for the repeal of s. 13, arguing that it violated freedom of expression, guaranteed by [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s. 2 of the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'']]. Martin said that hate crimes, slander and libel would still be outlawed under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']], while his motion would stop the federal human rights tribunal from imposing restrictions on freedom of speech using taxpayers' money.

==Criticism of Canadian censorship==

Canada's 22nd Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, prior to becoming Prime Minister, stated "Human rights commissions, as they are evolving, are an attack on our fundamental freedoms and the basic existence of a democratic society … It is in fact totalitarianism. I find this is very scary stuff."<ref>[http://www.canadians.org/democracy/documents/p8.pdf ''BC Report Newsmagazine''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019083629/http://www.canadians.org/democracy/documents/p8.pdf |date=October 19, 2012 }}, January 11, 1999</ref>

[[PEN Canada]], an organization which assists writers who are persecuted for peaceful expression, has called on "the federal and provincial governments to change human rights commission legislation to ensure commissions can no longer be used to attempt to restrict freedom of expression in Canada."<ref>[http://www.safs.ca/april2008/pencanada.html "PEN Canada Calls for Changes to Human Rights Commission Legislation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055352/http://www.safs.ca/april2008/pencanada.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, PEN Canada as posted by the Society for Academic Freedom and Scholarship, February 4, 2008</ref>

According to Mary Agnes Welch, president of the Canadian Association of Journalists, "[h]uman rights commissions were never intended to act as a form of thought police, but now they're being used to chill freedom of expression on matters that are well beyond accepted Criminal Code restrictions on free speech."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/February2008/22/c5147.html |title=Canadian Association of Journalists &#124; CAJ urges changes to human rights laws |publisher=Newswire.ca |date=February 22, 2008 |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref>

A group of several dozen professors from the 7,000-member [[American Political Science Association]] contend that recent free speech precedents in Canada put academics at risk of prosecution. The group includes [[Robert P. George|Robert George]] and [[Harvey Mansfield]], and they have protested holding the scheduled 2009 APSA annual meeting in Canada for this reason.<ref>[https://archive.today/20080827114431/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=743273 "Academics fear speaking freely in Canada"], Kevin Libin, ''National Post'', August 23, 2008, retrieved Sept 5, 2014</ref> The leadership of APSA selected Toronto as the meeting location.

There have been multiple lawsuits claiming that censorship violates multiple basic human rights, such as Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which protects the fundamental freedoms of thought, belief, and opinion.  These accusations have been of the violation of the rights and freedoms through certain types of censorship.
