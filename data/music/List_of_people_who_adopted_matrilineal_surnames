This is a list of notable people who have changed, adopted or adjusted their [[surname]]s based on a mother's or grandmother's [[maiden name]]. Included are people who [[name change|changed their legal names]] and people who created personal or professional [[pseudonym]]s.

==Stage names==
Many [[actor]]s and other entertainers elect to add or include their mothers' maiden names in their adopted [[stage name]]s. The book ''How to be a Working Actor: The Insider's Guide to Finding Jobs in Theater, Film, and Television'' advises aspiring performers to consider changing their names, noting that "if [your birth name] is difficult to spell, pronounce, or remember, it may not be the name you want for your professional career." It goes on to suggest: "If you want to retain a connection to your family, try using your mother's maiden name or the name of a revered relative."<ref>Mari Lyn Henry and Lynne Rogers (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=v0t9KQGqkoIC&pg=PT101 ''How to be a Working Actor (5th Edition): The Insider's Guide to Finding Jobs in Theater, Film, and Television''], [[Random House]]; {{ISBN|0-8230-8895-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8230-8895-9}}.</ref>

A person's mother's maiden name is used by many [[financial institution]]s as a [[Security question|key piece]] of information to validate a customer's identity.<ref name=theatretickets/> In 2005, researchers showed that the common practice of using a mother's maiden name as the basis for a [[stage name]] could be exploited to entice people to reveal that name and other details that could allow [[fraudster]]s to [[identity theft|steal their identities]]. Researchers asked a random sample of people on London streets a series of questions, beginning with "What is your name?" They then engaged in conversation about [[theatre]], asked people if they knew how actors choose their stage names, then told them that stage names were typically a combination of the name of a [[pet]] and the mother's maiden name. Next the participants were asked what their stage names would be; 94% responded by revealing both their mother's maiden name and a pet's name.<ref name=theatretickets>[http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=3035 "Survey Reveals That People Will Give Away Their Identity For A Chance To Win Theatre Tickets"], net-security.org, 24 March 2005; accessed 17 February 2011.
