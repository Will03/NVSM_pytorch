The '''electronic sackbut''' is an instrument designed by [[Hugh Le Caine]] in the 1940s.

The electronic [[sackbut]] had a feature which resembles what has become the modulation wheels on moderen [[synthesizer]]s: The player used the left hand to modify the sound while the right hand was used to play the [[keyboard (music)|keyboard]].<ref>[http://www.hughlecaine.com/en/sackbut.html hughlecaine.com]</ref> This compares with today's synthesizers which have one or several modulation wheels to the left of the keyboard (often controlling modulation and pitch).

The controller modified [[loudness|volume]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]], and [[timbre]]. Thus it was one of the first electronic instruments to use a three-dimensional continuous controller to modify the sound in a live situation. Such control is still rare in electronic instruments.

Le Caine began working full-time in a new lab at the [[National Research Council of Canada]] in 1954, where he built over 20 different new instruments before his death in 1977. While he developed four models of the electronic sackbut, none ever saw commercial production.
