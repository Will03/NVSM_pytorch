'''Timeline of jazz education''' (a chronology of [[Jazz education|jazz pedagogy]]):  The initial jazz education movement in North American was much an outgrowth of the music education movement that had been in full swing since the 1920s. Chuck Suber ''(né'' Charles Harry Suber; 1921–2015), former editor of ''[[Down Beat]]'',<ref name="DB 2016 Mar" /> averred that the [[GI Bill]] following [[World War II]] was a key impetus for the jazz education movement in higher education.  During the [[WWII]], the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] had been the nation's largest employer of musicians – including women musicians.<ref name="WWII-ArmyBands-info" group=upper-roman /><ref name="Sullivan 2011" />  After the [[World War II|War]], many of those musicians sought to pursue music as a career, and, with assistance of the [[GI Bill]], found colleges offering curricular jazz.  Suber also pointed out that the rise of stage bands in schools was directly proportionate to the decline of big name bands.<ref name="DecaturDaily 1964 Jan 12" group=lower-roman /><ref name="Lopes 2002" /><ref name="JazzEdJournal Milowski 2001/2002" />

Examples include the [[Eastman School of Music]], a constituent of the [[University of Rochester]], and [[Ithaca College School of Music]], a constituent of [[Ithaca College]].  Definitions of "major music conservatories of North America" – as stand-alone institutions – vary.  Nonetheless, this section does not include constituents of other institutions.</ref>

<ref name="WWII-ArmyBands-info">During [[World War II]], approximately 500 bands served the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. The [[United States military bands|bands]] were categorized into three types: special bands, separate bands, and organization bands. The [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] had their own [[United States Armed Forces School of Music|schools of music]].</ref>

<ref name="JackEnd-bio">Jack End (1918–1986) became the first official director of [[Eastman School of Music|Eastman's]] jazz band (in the 1940s).  He had earned a Bachelor of Music degree in performance (clarinet) from [[Eastman School of Music|Eastman]] in 1940.</ref>

<ref name="JazzDegrees1950s">Philip Allen Scott, in his 1973 book, ''Jazz Educated, Man'' (cited below), stated that, until 1967, [[University of North Texas College of Music|North Texas]] was the only college that offered a jazz oriented degree.  Jaap Gerritse, in 1987, however, stated that in the 1950s, 5 colleges offered a jazz oriented degree. (Gerritse 1987) Michael Spencer, PhD, identified five academic [[United States|U.S.]] institutions offering jazz oriented degrees: (i) the [[Schillinger House]] (beginning 1945), (ii) Westlake College of Music in (beginning 1945), (iii) [[Los Angeles City College]] (beginning 1946), (iv) [[California Polytechnic State University]] (beginning 1948), and (v) [[University of North Texas College of Music|North Texas]] (beginning 1947). (Spencer, ''Journal of Historical Research in Music Education,'' October 2013)  However, [[Berklee School of Music]] ([[Schillinger House]]) did not award a [[Bachelor of Music]] degree until 1966; Los Angeles City College offered only [[Associate's Degrees]]; and Westlake closed in 1961.</ref>
