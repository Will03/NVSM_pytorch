'''''John Peel's Record Box''''' is a [[documentary film]] made by Elaine Shepherd, released on 14 November 2005 on [[Channel 4]]. It was nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award]].

__TOC__

== Contents ==

It is about a small private collection of the British radio DJ [[John Peel]] who died in 2004 at the age of 65. Peel's main archive contained more than 100,000 vinyl records and CDs. This smaller private collection, however, contains 143 singles - some of them doublettes - stored in a private wooden box representing some of his personal favourites. According to the documentary, there are no singles by Peel's favorite group, [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], because he kept them in a separate box.

The film features interviews with John's wife Sheila Ravenscroft, radio DJs and artists like [[Mary Anne Hobbs]], [[Sir Elton John]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Feargal Sharkey]], [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], [[Michael Palin]] and [[Miki Berenyi]].{{Clear}}
