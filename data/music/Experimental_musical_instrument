An '''experimental musical instrument''' (or '''custom-made instrument''') is a [[musical instrument]] that modifies or extends an existing instrument or class of instruments, or defines or creates a new class of instrument.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}<!--If this claim is defensible, somebody had better send a letter to Mssrs. Sachs & Hornbostel.--> Some are created through simple modifications, such as cracked drum cymbals{{clarify|date=July 2014}}<!--What on earth is a "drum cymbal"? There is no Wikipedia article with this title.--> or metal objects inserted between piano strings in a [[prepared piano]]. Some experimental instruments are created from household items like a homemade [[mute (music)|mute]] for brass instruments such as bathtub plugs. Other experimental instruments are created from electronic spare parts, or by mixing acoustic instruments with electric components.

The instruments created by the earliest 20th-century builders of experimental musical instruments, such as [[Luigi Russolo]] (1885–1947),
[[Harry Partch]] (1901–1974), and [[John Cage]] (1912–1992), were not well received by the public at the time of their invention. Even mid-20th century builders such as  [[Ivor Darreg]], [[Pierre Schaeffer]] and [[Pierre Henry]] did not gain a great deal of popularity. However, by the 1980s and 1990s, experimental musical instruments gained a wider audience when they were used by bands such as [[Einstürzende Neubauten]] and [[Neptune (band)|Neptune]].

==Types==
[[File:UneJeunePucelle par hydraulophone.ogv|thumb|Video of a [[hydraulophone]]; song is "[[Huron Carol]]"; "[[Une Jeune Pucelle]]"]]
Experimental musical instruments are made from a wide variety of materials, using a range of different sound-production techniques.
Some of the simplest instruments are percussion instruments made from scrap metal, like those created by German band Einstürzende Neubauten. Some experimental [[hydraulophone]]s have been made using sewer pipes and plumbing fittings.<ref>[http://oddstrument.com/2008/05/02/hydraulophones-amazing-woodwater-instruments/ Hydraulophones, Amazing Woodwater Instruments Collection]</ref>

Since the late 1960s, many experimental musical instruments have incorporated electric or electronic components, such as [[Fifty Foot Hose]] 1967-era homemade synthesizers, [[Wolfgang Flür]] and [[Florian Schneider]]'s playable electronic percussion pads, and [[Future Man]]'s homemade drum machine made out of spare parts and his electronic [[Synthaxe]] [[Drumitar]].

Some experimental musical instruments are created by luthiers, who are trained in the construction of string instruments. Some custom made [[string instrument]]s are employed with three [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]]s,<ref>[http://www.oddmusic.com/gallery/om21600.html Moodswinger - Experimental electric zither musical instrument, unique and unusual<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> instead of the usual two (counting the [[nut (instrument)|nut]] as a bridge). By adding a third bridge, one can create a number of unusual sounds reminiscent of [[chime (bell instrument)|chime]]s, [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s or [[harp]]s<ref name="calguitar">{{cite web|url=http://www.calguitar.com/files/page_prepared.pdf|date=7 September 2013|title=PREPARATION MATERIALS|accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref><ref>Prepared Guitar Techniques - Matthew Elgart/Peter Yates (Elgart/Yates Guitar Duo) {{ISBN|0-939297-88-4}}, California Guitar Archives, 1990 [http://www.calguitar.com/show_unit.php?unit_id=7]</ref><ref name="PencilinaInsts">{{cite web|url=http://pencilina.com/insts.html|title=About the pencilina|publisher=pencilina.com|accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref><ref>[http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/tagsViewSingle.php?id=8278 freesound :: view tag :: prepared-guitar<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A 'third bridge instrument' can be a "[[prepared guitar]]" modified with an object – for instance, a screwdriver – placed under the strings to act as a makeshift bridge, or it can be a [[custom made instrument]].

One of the first guitarists who began building instruments with an extra bridge was [[Fred Frith]]. Guitarist and composer [[Glenn Branca]] has created similar instruments which he calls harmonic guitars or mallet guitars. Since the 1970s, German guitarist and [[luthier]] [[Hans Reichel]] has created guitars with third-bridge-like qualities.

Modern Day electronic low voltage experimental musical instruments, can be found at Bentmonkeycage in California USA. These glitched instruments are used in Movie Soundtracks, Live DUBNOISE performances, DJ performances, and Recording. The electronic unengineered circuitry within the device, can be manipulated with simple body contacts, light sensitive photocells, infrared signals, and radio waves (as in a theremin).

<!-- PLEASE DON'T ADD RED COLORED NAMES HERE! Make a topic first and then add the person or band here, Red links will be removed. -->

===1900–1950s===
[[Image:Russolointonorumori.jpg|derecha|thumb|Luigi Russolo and his intonarumori]]
Luigi Russolo (1885–1947) was an Italian [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] painter and [[composer]], and the author of the manifestoes ''[[The Art of Noises]]'' (1913) and ''Musica Futurista''.
Russolo invented and built [[Custom-made instrument|instrument]]s including [[intonarumori]] ("intoners" or "noise machines"), to create "noises" for performance. Unfortunately, none of his original intonarumori survived World War II. Replicas are being made though.

[[Léon Theremin]] was a Russian inventor, most famous for his invention of the [[theremin]] around 1919–1920, one of the first [[electronic musical instrument]]s. The [[Ondes Martenot]] is another early example of an electronic musical instrument.

The [[luthéal]] is a type of prepared piano created by [[George Cloetens]] in the late 1890s and used by [[Maurice Ravel]] in his ''Tzigane'' for luthéal and violin. The instrument can produce sounds like a [[guitar]] or a [[harmonica]], with strange tick-tocking sounds. It had several tone-colour (not exclusively "pitch") [[Register (music)|register]]s that could be engaged by pulling stops above the keyboard. One of these registers had a [[cimbalom]]-like sound, which fitted well with the gypsy-esque idea of the composition.
[[File:Harry Partch Institute-6.jpg|thumb|left|Partch's chromelodion]]
Harry Partch (1901–1974) was an [[United States|America]]n [[composer]] and instrument builder. He was one of the first twentieth-century composers to work extensively and systematically with [[microtonality|microtonal]] [[scale (music)|scale]]s, writing much of his [[music]] for [[custom-made instruments]] he built himself, tuned in 11-[[limit (music)|limit]] [[just intonation]].
His adapted instruments include the adapted viola, three adapted guitars, and a 10-string fretless guitar. As well, he retuned the reeds of several [[reed organ]]s and designed and built many instruments from raw materials, including the Diamond Marimba, Cloud Chamber Bowls, the Spoils of War, and a Gourd Tree.
[[File:Christian Wolff prepared piano performance 2007 Feb.jpg|thumb|[[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]] removes prepared objects]]
John Cage (1912–1992) was an American [[composer]] who pioneered the fields of [[Aleatoric music|chance music]], [[electronic music]] and [[Extended technique|unorthodox use of musical instruments]]. Cage's prepared piano pieces used a piano with its sound altered by placing various objects in the strings). He was the first to use phonograph records as musical instruments (in his 1939 composition [[Imaginary Landscape No.1]].  Cage also devised ways to perform using sounds which were nearly inaudible by incorporating photograph cartridges and contact microphones (his 1960 composition [[Cartridge Music]]). [[Ivor Darreg]] (1917–1994) was a leading proponent of and [[composer]] of [[microtonal music|microtonal]] or "[[xenharmonic]]" music. He also created a series of experimental musical instruments. In the 1940s, Darreg built an amplified cello, amplified clavichord and an electric keyboard drum.

===1950s–1960s===
[[Kraftwerk]] is known for their homemade synthesizers in the early 70s.
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:cracklebox.jpg|thumb|left|A 1960s-era [[cracklebox]] instrument]] -->
In the 1960s, [[Michel Waisvisz]] and Geert Hamelberg developed the [[Kraakdoos]] (or Cracklebox), a custom made battery-powered noise-making electronic device. It is a small box with six metal contacts on top, which when pressed by fingers will generate a range of unusual sounds and tones. The human body becomes a part of the circuit and determines the range of sounds possible; different people will generate different sounds.

===1970s–1980s===
[[File:Neola stringed musical instrument.jpg|thumb|Neola stringed musical instrument]]
The neola is a tenor [[stringed musical instrument]] invented in 1970 by Goronwy Bradley Davies, [[Llanbedr]], Wales. Plastics and aluminium were used in the design and the invention was recognized in a British Patent (registered 16 August 1972) and a Design Council award. The name "Neola" was registered for the instrument.<ref name="LensSearch">{{cite web|url=http://www.lens.org/lens/patent/GB_1285542_A|title=Stringed Musical Instrument|year=1972|publisher=lens.org|accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref><ref>[http://uk.trademarkdirect.co.uk/neola-1080371 ''stringed musical instruments'']</ref> The invention is intended as a tenor, replacing an instrument in the [[viol]] family that has been surpassed by the more recent [[violin]] family. The strings are tuned to G2, D3, A3, and E4, an octave below the violin, and the instrument may be performed similar to a [[violoncello]]. ‘Cello players would need to adapt their technique to accommodate the shorter string and body length, and use of the [[thumb position]] would not be the same. The design specifications are well suited to industrial manufacture, retaining consistency in quality. This is not the case with traditional instruments since the choice of fine materials and the skills of the luthier are essential in producing instruments with superior sound qualities.

In the mid-1970s, [[Allan Gittler]] (1928–2003) made an experimental [[custom-made instrument]] called the [[Gittler guitar]]. The Gittler guitar has 6 strings, each string has its own [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]]. The later versions have a plastic body. The steel frets give the instrument a sitar-like feel. Six individual pick ups can be routed to divided outputs.

[[Z'EV]] and Einstürzende Neubauten made several percussion instruments out of trash. [[No Wave]] artist [[Glenn Branca]] began building [[3rd bridge]] zithers with an additional movable bridge positioned on the [[just intonation|just intoned]] knotted positions of the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. [[Hans Reichel]] (Born 1949) is a German [[free improvisation|improvisational]] guitarist, luthier, and inventor. Reichel has constructed and built several variations of guitars and basses, most of them featuring multiple [[fretboard]]s and unique positioning of [[Pickup (music technology)|pickups]] as well as the same indirect playing technique as Branca's instruments. The resulting sounds exceed the range of conventional [[Musical tuning|tuning]] and add interesting effects, from odd overtones to metallic noises. Later he invented his Daxophone, where he's most famous for. His [[Daxophone]] consists of a single wooden blade fixed in a block containing a contact microphone. Normally, it is played by bowing the free end, but it can also be struck or plucked, which propagates sound in the same way a ruler halfway off a table does. These vibrations then continue to the wooden-block base, which in turn is amplified by the contact microphone(s) therein. A wide range of voice-like [[timbre]]s can be produced, depending on the shape of the instrument, the type of wood, where it is bowed, and where along its length it is stopped with a separate block of wood ([[fret]]ted on one side) called the "dax."

American composer [[Ellen Fullman]] (born in 1957) developed a [[long-string instrument|Long String instrument]] in the early 1980s, which is tuned in [[just intonation]] and played by walking along the length of the long strings and rubbing them with [[rosin]]ed hands and producing longitudinal vibrations.

[[Bradford Reed]] invented the [[pencilina]], a [[custom-made instrument|custom-made string instrument]] in the 1980s. It is a double-neck 3rd bridge guitar that is similar in construction to two long, thin zithers connected by a stand. Wedged over and under the strings in each neck is an adjustable rod, a wooden drum stick for the guitar strings and a metal rod for the bass strings. In addition, there are four [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s. The pencilina is played by striking its strings and bells with sticks. The strings may also be [[pizzicato|plucked]] or [[bow (music)|bowed]].

[[Uakti (band)|Uakti]] (WAHK-chee) is a [[Brazil]]ian instrumental musical group active in the 1980s known for using [[custom-made instruments]] built by the group. Marco Antônio constructed various instruments in his basement out of [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipe, wood, and metal.

Remo Saraceni made a number of Synthesizer type instruments with unusual interfaces, his most famous being [[Big piano|The Walking piano]] made famous in the film ''[[Big (film)|Big]].''

In the 1980s, the [[folgerphone]] was developed. It is a [[Wind instruments|wind instrument]] (or [[aerophone]]), classifiable as a [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]] rather than [[brass instrument]] despite being made of metal, because it has a reed (cf. [[saxophone]]). It is made from an [[alto saxophone|alto sax]] mouthpiece, with copper tubing and a coffee can. Although it uses sax parts, it is a [[cylindrical bore]] instrument, and thus part of the [[clarinet]] family.

In India, the new instrument based on harmonium style was developed by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq3uhtBIrE8 Pt. Manohar Chimote] with the combination of keys and sympathetic strings to create the tone most suitable for solo playing. This was named as "Samvadini". It is based on just intonation tuning system and played in one key. It is exclusive solo instrument with great potentials. His follower [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88z_I1St5GA Jitendra Gore] now plays this solo instrument.

===1990s and 2000s===
[[Image:Electrocardiophones with electroencephalophone softub4.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[electrocardiophone]]s and one [[electroencephalophone]], which use brain waves to generate or modulate sounds.]]
The [[bazantar]] is a five-string [[double bass]] with 29 [[sympathetic strings|sympathetic]] and 4 [[drone string]]s and has a [[melodic range]] of five [[octave]]s invented by musician Mark Deutsch, who worked on the design between 1993 and 1997 ({{Cite patent|US|5883318}} issued March 16, 1999). It is designed as a separate housing for sympathetic strings (to deal with the increased string tension) mountable on a double bass or [[cello]], modified to hold drone strings.

[[Ken Butler]] makes odd-shaped, guitar-like instruments made out of trash, [[rifle]]s and other material. He also builds violins in eccentric shapes.

[[Cor Fuhler]] (1964) is a Dutch/Australian improvising musician, composer and instrument builder, known for his pioneering extended piano techniques. He created the [[keyolin]] in the 1990s. The keyolin is a 2-string violin played via a mechanical keyboard, which controls pitch, vibrato, glissandos and partials. A customised bow, played upside down, controls timbre and volume.

[[Iner Souster]] (born in 1971) is a builder of experimental musical instruments, visual artist, musician, fauxbot designer and film maker who lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Souster builds most of his instruments from trash, found, and salvaged materials. Some of his instruments are one-string [[string instrument]]s, or [[thumb piano]]s.
One of his more complicated instruments is the "Bowafridgeaphone" (bow a fridge a phone).

[[Leila Bela]] is an [[Iran]]ian-born American [[avant-garde]] [[musician]] and record producer from [[Austin, Texas]].

The Japanese multi-instrumentalist and experimental musical instrument builder [[Yuichi Onoue]] developed a two string [[hurdy-gurdy]] like a fretless violin, called the [[Kaisatsuko]], as well as a deeply scalloped electric guitar for [[microtonal music|microtonal]] playing techniques.<ref>[http://www.hypercustom.com/yuichionoue.html Yuichi Onoue's Kaisatsuko on hypercustom.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108182752/http://www.hypercustom.com/yuichionoue.html |date=2015-11-08 }}</ref>

[[Solmania]] from Japan, and Neptune are [[noise music]] bands that built their own [[custom made instrument|custom made guitars and basses]]. Solmania modifies their instruments with extra droning strings. 
Neptune built guitars out of scrap metal and make [[electric lamellophone]]s. The bass is built using a [[VCR]] casing and another one of their instruments has a jagged [[scythe]] at the end of it. They also play on custom made [[percussion instruments]] and [[Lamellophone|electric lamellophones]]. Neptune began in 1994 as a student art project by sculptor/musician Jason Sanford. In 2006 Neptune signed with [[Table of the Elements]], an experimental record label that also has performers such as [[Rhys Chatham]], [[John Cale]], and [[Captain Beefheart]] on its roster.

The [[Blue Man Group]] also experimented with home-made percussive instruments, made from PVC pipes and other materials. A specially-constructed studio was needed for the recording of their first album.

In the mid 90´s, Californian nu metal band [[Motograter]] invented the eponymous instrument in place of a bass guitar. The Motograter is made out of 2 large industrial springs mounted on a metal platform, producing unique chunky guitar and bass tones with a strong "RRRRRR" sound. The Motograter´s sound is loosely comparable with a slow running cutting/drilling device.

In the 2000s, Canadian [[luthier]] [[Linda Manzer]] created the Pikasso guitar, a 42-string guitar with three necks. It was popularized by jazz guitarist [[Pat Metheny]], who used it on the song "Into the Dream" and on several albums. Its name is ostensibly derived from its likeness in appearance to the [[cubism|cubist]] works of [[Pablo Picasso]].

In 2000, Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer developed the [[hang (instrument)|hang]] in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]].

In 2003 the [[Tritare]] was created by Samuel Gaudet and Claude Gauthier in Canada. Experimental luthier [[Yuri Landman]] built a variety of electric [[string resonance]] [[tailed bridge guitar|tailed bridge]] and 3rd bridge guitars like the [[Moodswinger]], [[Moonlander (musical instrument)|Moonlander]] and the [[Springtime (guitar)|Springtime]] for [[indie rock]] and [[noise rock]] acts like [[Sonic Youth]], [[Liars (band)|Liars]], [[Blood Red Shoes]] as well as electric [[thumb piano]]s, electric drum guitars, and [[spring (device)|spring]] drum instruments.

[[Image:Sea organ Zadar 1.jpg|thumb|Bašić's sea organ, which creates sound from sea waves by using tubes built under the marble steps]]
In 2005, architect Nikola Bašić built a [[Sea organ]] in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]], which is an experimental musical instrument which plays music by way of sea waves and tubes located underneath a set of large marble steps. Concealed under these steps is a system of polyethylene tubes and a resonating cavity that turns the site into a huge musical instrument, played by the wind and the sea. The waves create somewhat random but harmonic sounds.

Instigated by composer-researcher [[Georg Hajdu]] in 2006, [[Stephen Fox (clarinet maker)]] of Toronto, Canada, began building a new class of clarinets, called BP clarinets, able to play the [[Bohlen–Pierce scale]] of 146.3 cents per step.<ref>Müller, Nora-Louise, Konstantina Orlandatou, and Georg Hajdu. "Starting Over – Chances Afforded by a New Scale," pp. 127 and 171 in ''1001 Mikrotöne / 1001 Microtones,'' edited by Sarvenaz Safari and Manfred Stahnke. Neumünster: von Bockel Verlag, 2015.</ref> To date two available sizes are played by a small but growing number of professional clarinettists in Canada, the US, Germany and Estonia, with two more sizes under consideration.

Starting in 2006, [[Ice Music Festival]] celebrates musical instruments made of ice.

In 2010, composer [[Alexis Kirke]] and technologist Tim Hodgson turned the [[University of Plymouth]]'s Roland Levinsky Building into a form of musical instrument to be played by the rising sun, as part of [[Peninsula Arts Contemporary Music Festival]]. Light sensors were placed across seven floors of the building and fed by radio network into a computer music instrument analogous to a [[Mellotron]]. As the sun rose the "Sunlight Symphony" played in the reverberant space of the Roland Levinsky Building's open plan foyer.

For her 2011 album [[Biophilia (album)|Biophilia]], Icelandic artist [[Björk]] developed an instrument based on a [[Tesla Coil]] and a second instrument described as a cross between a [[Gamelan]] and a [[Celesta]], dubbed the "Gameleste."

In 2013, a research team of [[McGill University]] came up with digital musical instruments made in the form of [[Musical Prostheses]].

In 2014, Andrei Remyannikov of Russia developed the RAV vast drum.
