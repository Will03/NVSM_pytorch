'''New Interfaces for Musical Expression''', also known as '''NIME''', is an international conference dedicated to scientific research on the development of new technologies and their role in musical expression and artistic performance. Researchers and musicians from all over the world gather to share their knowledge and late-breaking work on new musical interface design.

==History==
The conference began as a workshop (NIME 01) at the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) in 2001 in [[Seattle, Washington]], with the concert and demonstration sessions being held at the [[Experience Music Project]] museum. Since then, international conferences have been held annually around the world:

* NIME 2002 was hosted by [[Media Lab Europe]] in [[Dublin]], Ireland.
* NIME 2003 was held at [[McGill University]], [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada.
* NIME 2004 was hosted by [[Shizuoka University of Art and Culture]], [[Hamamatsu]], Japan.
* NIME 2005 was held at the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.
* NIME 2006 was hosted by [[IRCAM]], [[Paris]], France. 
* NIME 2007 was held in [[New York City]], hosted by the Harvestworks Digital Media Arts Center, [[New York University]]'s Music Technology Program and the Interactive Telecommunications Program in the [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. 
* NIME 2008 was hosted by the [http://www.infomus.dist.unige.it/ Infomus Lab] at the [[University of Genova]],<ref>http://nime2008.casapaganini.org/</ref> Italy. 
* NIME 2009 was held at the [[Carnegie Mellon School of Music]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. 
* NIME 2010 hosted by [[University of Technology, Sydney]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.<ref>http://www.educ.dab.uts.edu.au/nime/</ref> 
* NIME 2011 was held at the [[University of Oslo]] in [[Oslo]], Norway. 
* NIME 2012 was hosted by the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], USA.<ref>http://www.eecs.umich.edu/nime2012/</ref>
* NIME 2013 was hosted by the Graduate School of Culture Technology at [[KAIST]] (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), [[Daejeon]], [[South Korea]], and featured a series of special events in [[Seoul]]
* NIME 2014 was held at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths University]] in [[London]], [[Great Britain]].
* NIME 2015 was held at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]], United States.<ref>http://nime2015.lsu.edu/</ref>
* NIME 2016 was held at [[Griffith University]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia. July 11–15.<ref>http://nime2016.org/</ref>
* NIME 2017 was hosted by [[Aalborg University]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.<ref>http://www.nime2017.org/</ref>
* NIME 2018 was held by [[Virginia Tech]] and the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]], [[Virginia]].  <ref>http://nime2018.icat.vt.edu</ref>

==Areas of application==

The following is a partial list of topics covered by the NIME conference:

* Design reports on novel controllers and interfaces for musical expression
* Performance experience reports on live performance and composition using novel controllers
* Controllers for virtuosic performers, novices, education and entertainment
* Perceptual & cognitive issues in the design of musical controllers
* Movement, visual and physical expression with sonic expressivity
* Musical mapping algorithms and intelligent controllers
* Novel controllers for collaborative performance
* Interface protocols (e.g. [[MIDI]]) and alternative controllers
* Artistic, cultural, and social impact of new performance interfaces
* Real-time gestural control in musical performance
* Mapping strategies and their influence on digital musical instrument design
* [[Sensor]] and [[actuator]] technologies for musical applications
* [[Haptic technology|Haptic]] and force feedback devices for musical control
* [[Real-time computing]] tools and interactive systems
