'''Popcorn''' (sometimes '''Belgian popcorn''' or '''oldies popcorn''') is a style of music and dancing first established in [[Belgium]] in the 1970s and 1980s.  The style includes a wide variety of mostly American and British recordings of [[R&B]] and [[pop music]] made between the late 1950s and mid 1960s, often relatively obscure, and characterised by a slow or medium, rather than fast, [[tempo]]. The style has been described by musician and writer [[Bob Stanley (musician)|Bob Stanley]] as "possibly the last truly underground music scene in Europe".

==Origins==
The Popcorn music scene first developed from dances held at the Groove [[discotheque]] in [[Ostend]], where mid-tempo [[soul music|soul]] and [[ska]] music played by [[DJ]] [[Freddy Cousaert]] became popular in the late 1960s.<ref name=scarpone>[http://users.skynet.be/scarpone_michel/history.htm Michel Scarpone, "History of Belgium Popcorn", first published in ''Discoveries'' magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127124654/http://users.skynet.be/scarpone_michel/history.htm |date=2011-01-27 }}.

In September 1969, a café, De Oude Hoeve, opened in a converted farm barn at [[Vrasene]] near Antwerp, and began holding dance competitions on Sunday afternoons. Soon up to 3,000 people began attending each week, dancing in a "slow swing" style to soul and [[funk]] records.  The café was renamed the Popcorn - after the [[James Brown]] hit "[[The Popcorn]]"—and DJ Gilbert Govaert began playing more early soul and other records from the 1960s to suit the dance style.<ref name=scarpone/><ref name=guardian/> According to Stanley: "The beat was slow and slightly rickety, martial drums rolled under melancholy minor chords—the [[Marvelettes]]' '[[Please Mr Postman]]' (1961) would have been typical."<ref name=frieze>[https://www.frieze.com/issue/article/music13/ Bob Stanley, "A voyage of discovery to Belgium's Popcorn clubs", ''Frieze'', no. 147, May 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223013236/https://www.frieze.com/issue/article/music13/ |date=2014-02-23 }}.

Following the Popcorn club's popularity, other clubs sprang up playing music in a similar style.  These included the Festival in [[Antwerp]], the Gatsby in [[Vliermaal]], and the Versailles, beside the beach at Ostend.  As well as Cousaert and Govaert, other leading DJs included Jeff Callebaut, Gerry Franken and Georges Toniotti.  Radio stations were set up to play the music, and rare music on obscure labels became especially prized.  The scene in Belgium in many ways paralleled the [[Northern soul]] scene in Britain, but with a slower swing style of music favoured, rather than the fast dance styles characteristic of Northern soul.  In some cases, DJs slowed down records, by [[pitch control]] and by playing 45 rpm discs at 33 rpm, to achieve the desired tempo and rhythm.  The range of the music also broadened, to include some British and Italian pop music from the early 1960s, and eventually local bands were formed to emulate the style.<ref name=guardian/><ref name=frieze/><ref name=brief/>

==Examples==
According to Bob Stanley, "the purity of Belgian Popcorn is its very impurity. R&B, Broadway numbers, tangos, Phil Spector-esque girl groups and loungey instrumentals, they are all constituent parts of a rare, and still largely undiscovered scene".  Examples of highly prized popcorn records include "Sweetheart" by [[Peggy Lee]], "Image" by Hank Levine,<ref name=guardian/> "Now I Lay Me Down to Weep" by Simone Dina, "The Tingle" by Jackie Weaver, "Who's Got the Action" by Phil Colbert,<ref name=frieze/> "Heartless Lover" by Dick Baker, "La Tanya" by Jay Abbott, "Carmelita" by Jeff Lane,<ref name=scarpone/> "I'm Crying in the Rain" by [[Major Lance]], "You Beat Me to the Punch" by [[Mary Wells]],<ref name=brief/> "[[Comin' Home Baby]]" by [[Mel Tormé]], and "Twine Time" by [[Alvin Cash]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://parkaavenue.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/a-beginners-guide-to-soul-music-part-ii.html |first=Patrick |last=Foisy |title=A Beginner's Guide to Soul Music: Part II - The obscure sub-genres [sic] |publisher=Parka Avenue (blog) |date=21 September 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref>

==Continuing popularity==
After a period of mainstream popularity in Belgium, and to a lesser extent in France and the Netherlands, the Popcorn dance scene retreated to smaller venues and specialist clubs, while retaining a core of [[aficionado]]s.  By the 1990s, the style was beginning to be known and appreciated at [[soul music]] [[nightclub|club]]s in Britain, Germany, and the US, and its level of recognition has continued to increase.<ref name=guardian/>  At least 30 compilations of American and other R&B and pop music in the Belgian Popcorn style have been issued in Europe.<ref name=scarpone/>
