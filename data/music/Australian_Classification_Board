The '''Australian Classification Board''' ('''ACB''' or '''CB''') is an [[Australian]] [[Government of Australia|Government]] [[Statute|statutory]] body responsible for the classification and censorship of films, video games and publications for [[exhibition]], sale or hire in Australia. The ACB was established in 1970 and was once part of the '''Office of Film and Literature Classification''' ('''OFLC'''), which was dissolved in 2006. The Department of Communications and the Arts now provides administrative support to the ACB and decisions made by the ACB may be reviewed by the Australian Classification Review Board.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classification.gov.au/About/Pages/Review-Board.aspx|title=Review Board {{!}} Australian Classification|website=www.classification.gov.au|access-date=2016-04-30}}</ref> The ACB now operates under the ''Commonwealth Classification Act 1995'', 

The ACB does not directly censor material by ordering cuts or changes. However, it is able to effectively censor media by refusing classification and making the media illegal for hire, exhibition and importation to Australia. 

The classification system has several levels of "restricted" categories, prohibiting sale, exhibition or use of some materials to those who are under a prescribed age. In 2005, video and computer games became subject to the same classification ratings and restrictions as films (with the exception of the R18+ and X18+ ratings), in response to confusion by parents.<ref>{{Cite news|edition=1 – State |page=11 |title=Games get film ratings |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=6 July 2005 |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15534581-421,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050609030406/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C10117%2C15534581-421%2C00.html |archivedate=9 June 2005 |deadurl=yes }}</ref> Despite a line in the ''National Classification Code'' stating that "adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want", the adult R18+ classification did not exist for video games in Australia before 1 January 2013.<ref>[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013C00006 The Classification Code; May 2005]</ref>

==History==
The Australian Classification Board was created in 1970 to classify or rate all films (and later in 1994, [[video games]]) that came into Australia. In the early years of the system, beginning in November 1971, there were four ratings:

*'''''G''''' for General Exhibition, carried over from the previous ratings system
*'''''NRC''''' Not Recommended for Children (previously ''X, A'' or ''Not Suitable for Children.'' This later became ''PG'' for Parental Guidance)
*'''''M''''' for Mature Audiences (Previously ''SOA'' or ''Suitable Only for Adults.'' This later became ''M 15+'' from the late 1980s until 2005)
*'''''R''''' for Restricted Exhibition (later became ''R 18+'' in the late 1980s)

The ''MA 15+'' rating was introduced in 1993, to flag content that was too strong for the ''M'' classification, but not so much so that the content should be restricted only to persons over the age of 18.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uLIpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JuUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4106,478776&dq=fritz+the+cat&hl=en|title=Censorship Classifications|date=1 July 1973|accessdate=18 September 2010|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=87}}</ref> 

The Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) was formed in 1994, and oversaw the Classification Board. In 2005 the ''OFLC'' was dissolved and supervision of the Classification Board transferred to the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]].

The current coloured classification markings for films and computer games were introduced in May 2005.<ref>[http://www.classification.gov.au/About/AnnualReports/Documents/673.pdf Annual Report 2004–2005]</ref>

In August 2014, the Australian Classification Board introduced amendments to allow for the automated classification process employed by the [[International Age Rating Coalition]]. This new process reduces the costs of video game developers as they seek to obtain ratings for their products that are distributed digitally online.<ref>http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/09/01/getting-digitally-distributed-games-classified-in-australia-to-be-cost-free</ref>

==Overview==
The Board operates on a procedure that primarily involves [[decision-making]]. The members must [[communicate]] their views clearly and appreciate the views of others. Board members would be exposed to a wide range of material, including content that is confronting and offensive. Every film and computer game has to be classified before it can be legally made available to the public.Some [[publications]] also need to be classified. Failure to give classification (especially for unclassified material that is likely to be classified RC) is an implicit [[ban (law)|ban]] (except for exempt films, games, and publications). It is an offence "to display, demonstrate, sell, hire, publicly exhibit or advertise a film or computer game" without having it classified. Some films and documentaries (such as [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] and those created for business, scientific and [[Video lesson|education]] purposes) are exempt from classification unless, if classified, they would be ''M'' or above.<ref>http://www.artslaw.com.au/info-sheets/info-sheet/classification-and-censorship/</ref>

There are legal age restrictions for the ratings of ''MA 15+'' and ''R 18+''. ''X 18+'' is a special restriction rating for adult content. The other classification categories (''G'', ''PG'' and ''M'') are merely recommendations and they are not submitted to legal age restrictions. ''RC'' (''banned'') material cannot be sold, hired or distributed to any persons. A film or video game's context is crucial in determining whether a classifiable element is justified by the story-line or themes.

The Classification Board decides what consumer advice accompanies each classification. They indicate the elements in films and computer games which caused the classification and help consumers make choices about what they read, view or play. There are six classifiable elements for films: ''themes'' (rape, suicide, racism, etc.), ''violence'' (the level of violence and how threatening it is in its context), ''sex'' (intercourse and references to sex), ''language'' (the level of coarse language), ''drug use'' (the use of, and references to, drugs) and ''nudity'' (the explicitness of nudity). Consumer advice appears with the classification symbol on products, [[packaging]] and in [[advertisements]]. Consumer advice is not given if the element in question would be acceptable at a lower classification.<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/Public/Resources/Pages/Parents.aspx</ref>

The Classification Board also classifies material submitted from the [[Australian police|police]], the [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]] and the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]]. The Board does not classify [[concert|live performance]]s, audio CDs and [[television shows]]. Television is regulated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.<ref>{{Cite news | page= 7 | last = Canna | first = Xavier La | title = New classifications pave way for R-rated games |work=The Age |location=Australia | accessdate = 2012-08-05 | date = 6 June 2005 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/New-classifications-pave-way-for-Rrated-games/2005/06/05/1117910187614.html }}</ref>

===Unrestricted/Advisory===
The classifications below are '''unrestricted''' and may require parental '''advisory''',  but do not impose any legal restrictions on access to or distribution of material.<ref name="cats explained">{{cite web |title=Information for Parents: Classification categories explained |publisher=Australian Classification Board |url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Public/Resources/Pages/Parents.aspx |accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref><ref name="Fact Sheets">{{cite web |last=Clare |first=Jason (Minister for Justice) |title=Guidelines for the Classification of Films 2012 |date=10 December 2012 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2012L02541 |accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>

[[File:OFLC small E.svg|90px]] [[File:Exempt for classification.png|280px]]

* '''''Exempt (E)''''' – Only very specific types of material (including educational material and artistic performances) can be exempt from classification, and the material cannot contain anything that exceeds the constraints of the PG classification.<ref>{{cite web |title=Is it exempt? |publisher=Australian Classification Board |url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Industry/Journey/Pages/Exemptions/Step1.aspx |accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> The assessment of exemption may be made by the distributor or exhibitor (self-assessed) without needing to submit the product for certification by the Classification Board. Self-assessed exempt films cannot use the official marking although it is advised that films and computer games that are self-assessed as exempt display, "This film/computer game is exempt from classification".

[[File:G tag.svg|90px]] [[File:OFLC large G.svg|280px]]

* '''''General (G)''''' – Contains material available for general viewing. This category does not necessarily designate a children's film or game. Although not mandatory at this category, the ''Board'' may provide consumer information. Consumer advice at G classification usually relates to impacts on very young children. The content is very mild in impact.
**'''Themes''' should have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be justified by context.
**'''Violence''' should have only a low sense of threat or menace, and be justified by context.
**'''Sexual activity''' should be very mild and very discreetly implied, and be justified by context.
**'''Coarse language''' should be very mild and infrequent and justified by context.
**'''Drug use''' should be implied only very discreetly, and be justified by context.
**'''Nudity''' should be justified by context.

[[File:PG.svg|90px]] [[File:OFLC large PG.svg|280px]]

* '''''Parental Guidance (PG)''''' – Not recommended for viewing or playing by people under 15 without guidance from parents or guardians. Contains material that young viewers may find confusing or upsetting. The content is mild in impact.
**'''Themes''' should have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be justified by context.
**'''Violence''' should be mild and infrequent, and be justified by context. Sexual violence is not permitted.
**'''Sexual activity''' should be mild and discreetly implied, and be justified by context.
**'''Coarse language''' should be mild and infrequent, and be justified by context.
**'''Sex, nudity and drug use''' should be mild, infrequent, "discreetly implied" and "justified by context".
**'''Drug use''' and '''nudity''' should be justified by context.

[[File:M.svg|90px]] [[File:OFLC large M.svg|280px]]

* '''''Mature (M)''''' – Recommended for people aged 15 years and over. People under 15 may legally access this material because it is an advisory category. This category contains material that may require a mature perspective, but is not deemed too strong for younger viewers. The content is moderate in impact.
**'''Themes''' may have a moderate sense of threat or menace, if justified by context.
**'''Moderate violence''' is permitted, if "justified by context". Sexual violence should be very limited and justified by context.
**'''Sexual activity''' should be discreetly implied, if "justified by context".
**'''Coarse Language''' may be used. Aggressive or strong coarse language should be infrequent and justified by context.
**'''Drug use''' and '''nudity''' should be justified by context.

===Restricted===
By contrast, the classifications below are legally '''restricted''': it is illegal to sell or exhibit material so classified to anyone younger than the mentioned minimum age.<ref name="cats explained"/><ref name="Fact Sheets"/>

[[File:MA 15+ classification tag from OFLC.svg|90px]] [[File:OFLC large MA15+.svg|280px]]

* '''''Mature Accompanied (MA 15+)''''' –  Contains material that is considered unsuitable for exhibition by persons under the age of 15. People under 15 may legally purchase, rent, exhibit or view such content only under the supervision of a parent or adult guardian. A person may be asked to show proof of age before renting or purchasing an MA 15+ film or computer game. The content is strong in impact.
**'''Realistic violence''' of medium intensity is permitted. Violent depictions with a "high degree or realism" is accepted only if "justified by context". Stylised violence, however, can be "more detailed".
**'''Strong Violence''' is permitted, although if it is bloody and strong it should be "infrequent" or "justified by context".
**'''Sexual violence''' is permitted only if it is "not frequent, gratuitous or exploitative".
**'''Sexual activity''' may be "discreetly implied" or "simulated".
**'''Nudity''' is permitted, but in a sexual context it should "not be exploitative".
**'''Frightening or Intense Scenes''' should "not disturb a reasonable adult".
**'''Aggressive and very strong coarse language''' may be used but it should "not be exploitative".
**'''Drug use''' may be depicted, but not in an "advocatory manner".
**'''Themes''', if strong, should be justified by context.

[[File:OFLC small R18+.svg|90px]] [[File:OFLC large R18+.svg|280px]]

* '''''Restricted (R 18+)''''' – Contains material that is considered unsuitable for exhibition to persons under the age of 18. People under 18 may not legally buy, rent, exhibit or view R 18+ classified content. A person may be asked for proof of their age before purchasing, hiring or viewing an R 18+ film or computer game at a retail store or cinema. Some material classified R 18+ may be offensive to sections of the adult community. The content is high in impact.
**'''"Realistic and explicit" depictions of violence''' is permitted, but violence that is "frequently gratuitous, cruel, exploitative and offensive to a reasonable adult" will not be permitted.
**'''Themes''' can have a "very high degree of intensity" but should not be "exploitative".
**'''Sexual violence''' is permitted only to the extent that they are "necessary to the narrative" and "not exploitative" or "not shown in detail".
**'''Sexual activity''' can be "realistically simulated", but depiction of "[[Unsimulated sex|actual sexual activity]] is not permitted".
**'''Drug use''' can be shown but "not gratuitously detailed" and should also "not be promoted or encouraged". For computer games, drug use related to "incentives and rewards" is not permitted.
**'''Nudity''' in a sexual context should "not include obvious genital contact".
**'''Coarse language''' is virtually unrestricted.

[[File:OFLC X 18 classification tag.svg|90px]] [[File:OFLC large X18+.svg|280px]]

* '''''Restricted (X 18+)''''' – Contains material that is [[pornographic]] in nature. People under 18 may not legally buy, rent, possess, exhibit or view these films. The exhibition or sale of these films to people under the age of 18 years is a criminal offence carrying a maximum fine of $5,500. Films classified as X 18+ are banned (via state government legislation) from being sold or rented in all [[Australian states]] (but are legal to possess except in certain parts of the Northern Territory) and are legally available to purchase only in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Northern Territory]]. Importing X 18+ material from these territories to any other state is legal (as the [[Australian Constitution]] forbids any restrictions on trade between the states and territories). The content is sexually explicit, and the rating does not exist for video games.
**This rating applies to films that "depict unsimulated sexual content only". Depictions of sexual violence, [[coercion]] and "sexually assaultive" language are "not allowed" in the category. Fetishes such as [[body piercing]], '[[golden showers]]', [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[BDSM|spanking or fisting]] are also "not permitted".

===Other labels===

[[File:Refused Classification Rating.jpg|170px]]

* '''''{{vanchor|RC}} (Refused Classification)''''' – Contains material that, while being, in most cases, legal to possess, is considered offensive to the standards of [[morality]], decency and propriety generally accepted by a 'reasonable adult' to the extent that it should not be classified. Classification is mandatory, and films that are ''Refused Classification'' by the ''ACB'' are legally banned for sale, hire or public exhibition, carrying a maximum [[fine (penalty)|fine]] of $275,000 and/or 10 years' [[jail]] if an individual/organisation is found to be in breach of this. It is, however, legal to possess RC films and games for people over 18 (except in [[Western Australia]] and certain parts of the [[Northern Territory]]) unless they contain illegal content (such as [[child pornography]]). The content is very high in impact.
** Films and games that exceed the X 18+ & R 18+ ratings (respectively) are Refused Classification by the ACB. Content that may be Refused Classification includes, but is not limited to:
*** Detailed instruction or promotion in matters of crime or violence.
*** The promotion or provision of instruction in paedophile activity.
*** Descriptions or depictions of child sexual abuse or any other exploitative or offensive descriptions or depictions involving a person who is, or appears to be, a child under 18 years.
*** Gratuitous, exploitative or offensive depictions of:
**** (i) violence with a very high degree of impact or which are excessively frequent, prolonged or detailed;
**** (ii) cruelty or real violence which are very detailed or which have an extremely high impact;
**** (iii) sexual violence.
*** Depictions of practices such as bestiality, necrophilia or other practices that are considered revolting or abhorrent. 
*** Gratuitous, exploitative or offensive depictions of:
**** (i) activity accompanied by fetishes or practices that are offensive or abhorrent;
**** (ii) incest fantasies or other fantasies that are offensive or abhorrent.

[[File:Check the Classification Australia.jpg|150px]] 
* '''''Check the Classification (CTC)''''' – The content has been assessed and approved for advertising unclassified films and computer games. "This film has advertising approval. Check the classification closer to the released date" is usually written on the marking.
**Any advertising of unclassified films and games must display the CTC message on posters, trailers, on the internet, and any other types of advertising.
**Once the content is classified, the classification marking replaces the CTC marking on all advertising material.

== Literature ratings ==
Publications such as [[books]] and [[magazines]] (though they would also include other printed media such as [[calendars]], [[greeting cards|cards]] and catalogues, among other things) are required to be classified if they contain depictions and/or descriptions of sexuality, drugs, nudity or violence that are unsuitable for a [[minor (law)|minor]] or even an adult who would take offence if sold as an unrestricted publication.

Publication classifications are most commonly applied to magazines with visual depictions of nudity or sexual activity, such as many [[men's magazines]]. It is uncommon for these ratings to appear on books, even those dealing with adult themes, except in the most controversial cases.

[[File:OFCL Australia Lit Rating- U.png|Unrestricted]] or [[File:OFCL Australia Lit Rating - UM.png|Unrestricted M (Mature)]]
*'''''Unrestricted'''''{{spaced ndash}}These publications are unrestricted, although they may not be recommended for readers under 15 years.

[[File:OFCL Australia Lit Rating - R1.png|Category 1 Restricted]]
*'''''Category 1 restricted'''''{{Spaced ndash}}These publications are not available to persons under 18 years. These may contain images of sexualised nudity. They must be distributed in a sealed wrapper. Their covers must be suitable for public display.

[[File:OFCL Australia Lit Rating - R2.png|Category 2 Restricted]]
*'''''Category 2 restricted'''''{{Spaced ndash}}Just like ''Category 1 restricted'' publications, they are not available to persons under 18 years. However, they contain explicit images of actual sexual activity which are not permissible under Category 1, and it may only be displayed in sites that are restricted to adults. Therefore, no publications that are likely to be classified ''Category 2 restricted'' may be displayed in public registered events.

[[File:Refused Classification Rating.jpg|120px]]
*'''''RC'''''{{Spaced ndash}}''RC'' publications are banned and cannot be sold or displayed anywhere in Australia.

The ''Restricted'' publications are for adults and they are not to be sold to people under 18 (and in [[Queensland]] under state law). They have content, such as nudity or explicit sexual content, that could offend some sections of the adult community. The ''Restricted'' categories are subject to various restrictions in different states; for example, one or both categories may only be sold in adults-only premises in certain states. For this reason, some adult magazines are published in two editions in Australia, or just one edited edition which can be sold anywhere with a warning, as ''Unrestricted Mature''.

==Controversies==

===Film===
{{See also|List of films banned in Australia}}

*[[Pasolini]]'s ''[[Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'' has twice been banned in Australia. The Home Affairs Minister, [[Brendan O'Connor (politician)|Brendan O'Connor]], asked the Classification Review Board to reassess the decision;<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/minister-asks-censors-to-reassess-approval-of-sadistic-film-20100416-skg2.html Minister asks censors to reassess approval of sadistic film]. SMH (17 April 2010).</ref> however, the review failed to find any fault in the classification. The film was banned in 1997, and was released after two failed attempts in September 2010, when the ''ACB'' classified an uncut version of ''Salò'' R18+, mainly due to extra material providing greater context.
*In 1992, Island World Communications Ltd and [[Manga Entertainment]] Australia Ltd had ''[[Urotsukidoji]]: Legend of the Overfiend'' submitted to the ''OFLC''. It was the first animated feature to be banned in Australia and the feature was banned outright, similar to ''[[Violence Jack]]''. ''Urotsukidoji'' was then censored to meet the OFLC's standards. The Australian version is the most censored in the [[western world]]. Many fans of [[anime]] imported uncensored versions of ''Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend'' from the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The rest of the ''Urotsukidoji'' series was censored in Australia, with many still importing or downloading the American versions.
*''[[Ninja Scroll]]'' was originally released in 1994 in Australia by ''Manga Entertainment Ltd''. It originally had the MA15+ rating on the VHS originally, but this was overturned in 1997 when [[Phillip Ruddock]] had the anime reviewed after an uncut screening of the movie on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]. A few months later it was given the R18+ rating and was uncut, then edited again, eventually using the [[BBFC]] cut of it. This was overturned in 2003 when [[Madman Entertainment]] and Manga Entertainment Ltd. released the uncut version.

Video gaming censorship in Australia is considered to be one of the strictest in the western world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opennet.net/research/australia-and-new-zealand |work=OpenNet |title=Australia & New Zealand}}</ref>

*''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' was withdrawn from sale for allowing players to have sexual intercourse with virtual prostitutes; the game was later reinstated when this action was removed. Specifically, the player could solicit intercourse from a virtual prostitute, and then kill her. The ability to solicit sex from prostitutes in the game was the action that was removed, but in-game characters and pedestrians could still violently murder them. ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'' was also pre-censored for the same reasons.  Though, in 2010 Vice City was classified uncut again receiving a MA15+.{{Cn|date=September 2018}}
*''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' was withdrawn from sale in July 2005 following the revelation that interactive sex scenes were included in the content files on the game's disc; one could not ordinarily access these scenes, but a third party modification, known as the [[Hot Coffee minigame controversy|Hot Coffee mod]], allowed the player to access these scenes within the game itself, and the inclusion of the scenes on the game disc took the game outside the MA15+ category. The MA15+ rating was re-instated after a modified version was released worldwide by [[Rockstar Games]], removing the content files for the sex scenes.
*''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' also prompted editing in the Australian ([[PAL]]) version, as Rockstar was worried it might get a RC rating. In the American release, sexual encounters with prostitutes occur inside the player's vehicle and the player has the ability to rotate the camera for a clearer view of what transpires. In the censored Australian version, the camera is fixed behind the vehicle, which rocks from side to side with accompanying audio effects. It is impossible for the player to view the inside of the car.<ref>[http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/869/869828p1.html IGN: Aussie GTA IV Censorship Update].

===Adult ratings for video games===
Many games were banned before 2011 on the basis that the R18+ rating for games did not exist at the time. This was the subject of complaint in the gaming community, who argued that there is no reason why adults should be prevented from seeing content in games that they could see in a film. One of the main opponents to the introduction of a R18+ rating for video games was the former South Australian Attorney-General [[Michael Atkinson]] who vetoed every attempt to induce one.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chloe |last=Lake |title=Attorney-general opposes R rating for games |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,23282288-5014239,00.html |work=News.com.au |publisher=News Limited |date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2008}}</ref>

On 11 August 2010, at a public forum, then opposition leader [[Tony Abbott]] was asked a question about his views on the absence of an R18+ rating for video games and whether he had any policies relating to the subject, saying, "if what happens with video games is not roughly analogous to what happens in other areas, that seems silly...Instinctively I'm with you, and it's something I'd be happy to look at, if we are in Government."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/tony-abbott-qa-from-rooty-hill/story-fn5z3z83-1225904099798 |title=Tony Abbott Q&A from Rooty Hill |newspaper=The Courier Mail |publisher=News Limited |date=11 August 2010 |first1=Michael |last1=Madigan |first2=Ben |last2=Packham}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2010/08/tony-abbott-happy-to-look-at-r18-rating/ |title=Tony Abbott: "Happy To Look At" R18+ Rating |work=Kotaku |first=David |last=Wildgoose |date=12 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itwire.com/it-industry-news/strategy/41091-abbott-pledges-r18-gaming-review |title=Abbott pledges R18+ gaming review |first=Renai |last=LeMay |date=11 August 2010 |work=iTWire |access-date=23 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195526/http://www.itwire.com/it-industry-news/strategy/41091-abbott-pledges-r18-gaming-review |archive-date=3 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://delimiter.com.au/2010/08/11/abbott-pledges-r18-gaming-review/ |title=Abbott pledges R18+ gaming review |first=Renai |last=LeMay |date=11 August 2010 |work=Delimiter |publisher= LeMay & Galt Media}}</ref> In December 2010, Attorney General Robert McClelland appeared to be moving on this issue following the release of telephone poll results conducted by the Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor, showing roughly 80% in support of a R18+ classification.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Consultationsreformsandreviews_AnR18+ClassificationforComputerGames-PublicConsultation?open&query=game |title=An R 18+ Classification for Computer Games |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |work=Attorney-General's Department |date=8 December 2010 |access-date=23 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403033305/http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Consultationsreformsandreviews_AnR18+ClassificationforComputerGames-PublicConsultation?open&query=game |archive-date=3 April 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 22 July 2011, at a meeting of State and Territories' Attorneys General, an agreement was reached for the introduction of an R18+ classification. It was planned to introduce the rating towards the end of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/historic-agreement-on-r18-video-games-20110722-1hs78.html|title='Historic agreement' on R18+ video games|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=22 July 2011|accessdate=24 February 2012}}</ref>
