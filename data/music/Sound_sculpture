'''Sound sculpture''' (related to [[sound art]] and [[sound installation]]) is an [[intermedia]] and time based art form in which [[sculpture]] or any kind of art object produces [[sound]], or the reverse (in the sense that sound is manipulated in such a way as to create a sculptural as opposed to temporal form or mass). Most often sound sculpture artists were primarily either [[Visual arts|visual artists]] or [[composer]]s, not having started out directly making sound sculpture.

[[Cymatics]] and [[kinetic art|kinetic]] art have influenced sound sculpture. Sound sculpture is sometimes [[site-specific art|site-specific]].

Grayson described sound sculpture in 1975 as "the integration of visual form and beauty with magical, musical sounds through participatory experience."<ref>{{cite book |last=Grayson |first=John |date=1975 |title=Sound sculpture : a collection of essays by artists surveying the techniques, applications, and future directions of sound sculpture |publisher=A.R.C.
