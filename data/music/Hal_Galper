'''Harold Galper''' (born April 18, 1938)<ref name="New Grove">{{cite book|last=Rinzler|first=Paul|title=The new Grove dictionary of jazz, vol. 2|year=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1561592846|edition=2nd|author2=Kernfeld, Barry|editor=Barry Kernfeld|page=8|chapter=Galper, Hal}}</ref> is a [[jazz]] pianist, composer, arranger, bandleader, educator, and writer.

==Biography==
He studied classical piano as a boy, but switched to jazz which he studied at the [[Berklee College of Music]] from 1955 to 1958.<ref name="New Grove" />  He hung out at Herb Pomeroy's club, the Stable, hearing local Boston musicians such as [[Jaki Byard]], [[Alan Dawson]] and [[Sam Rivers]]. Galper started sitting in and became the house pianist at the Stable and later on, at Connelly's and Lenny's on the Turnpike. He went on to work in Pomeroy's band.

Later on he worked with [[Chet Baker]] and [[Stan Getz]] and accompanied vocalists [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]], [[Anita O'Day]], and [[Chris Connor]].

Between 1973-1975, Galper played in the [[Cannonball Adderley]] Quintet replacing [[George Duke]].<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p6550/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography at allmusic]</ref> He performed in New York and Chicago jazz clubs in the late 1970s. Around this time, Galper recorded several times with guitarist [[John Scofield]] for the [[Enja Records|Enja]] label.

For 10 years (1980â€“1990) he was a member of [[Phil Woods]]'s quintet.<ref name="New Grove" />

Galper left the Woods group in August 1990 to start touring and recording with his new trio with Steve Ellington on drums and [[Jeff Johnson (bass player)|Jeff Johnson]] on bass. From 1990-1999, Hal's group was on the road six months a year.

Galper is internationally known as an educator. His theoretical and practical articles have appeared in six of ''[[Down Beat]]'' editions.  His scholarly article on the psychology of stage fright, originally published in the ''Jazz Educators Journal'', has subsequently been reprinted in four other publications.

Hal is on the faculty of [[Purchase College]] and [[the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music]].
