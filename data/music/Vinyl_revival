The '''Vinyl revival''' is the renewed interest and increased sales of [[vinyl records]], or gramophone records, that has been taking place in the Western world since about 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/chart/1465/vinyl-lp-sales-in-the-us/|title=Infographic: The LP is Back!|website=Statista Infographics|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>

The analogue format made of [[polyvinyl chloride]] had been the main vehicle for the commercial distribution of [[pop music]] from the 1950s until the 1980s and 1990s when they were largely replaced by the [[Compact Disc]] (CD). Since the turn of the millennium, CDs have been partially replaced by [[Music download|digital downloads]]. However, in 2007, vinyl sales made a sudden small increase, starting its comeback, and by the early 2010s it was growing at a very fast rate. In some territories, vinyl is now more popular than it has been since the late 1980s, though vinyl records still make up only a marginal percentage (<6%) of overall music sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/public%20factsheets/Soundscan/nielsen-2014-year-end-music-report-us.pdf |format=PDF |title=2014 Nielsen Music U.S. Report |website=Nielsen.com |accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>

Along with steadily increasing vinyl sales, the vinyl revival is also evident in the renewed interest in the [[record shop]] (as seen by the creation of the annual worldwide [[Record Store Day]]), the implementation of music charts dedicated solely to vinyl, and an increased output of films (largely independent) dedicated to the vinyl record and culture.

Though many sales in vinyl are of modern artists with modern styles or genres of music, the revival has sometimes been considered to be a part of the greater revival of [[retro style]], since many vinyl buyers are too young to remember vinyl being a primary music format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://umusic.co.uk/umusic-blog/meganwhitevinyl|title=Your turntable's not dead|date=13 July 2012|website=Umusic.co.uk|accessdate=29 November 2016}}</ref>

In June 2017, [[Sony Music]] announced that by March 2018 it would be producing vinyl records in-house for the first time since ceasing its production in 1989.<ref name="BBC News 29 June 2017">{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40445192|title= Sony Music goes back to vinyl records |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 29 June 2017|website= [[BBC News Online]] |publisher= BBC | accessdate= 29 June 2017 }}</ref> Reporting the decision, the [[BBC]] noted that, "Sony's move comes a few months after it equipped its Tokyo studio with a cutting lathe, used to produce the master discs needed for manufacturing vinyl records" but added that "Sony is even struggling to find older engineers who know how to make records".<ref name="BBC News 29 June 2017"/>

==History==

===In Canada and the United States===
In 1988, the [[Compact Disc]] surpassed the gramophone record in popularity. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991,<ref>Sources vary on the actual dates.</ref> when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles.

First, the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Entertainment Weekly|title=A Vinyl Farewell|date=4 October 1991|issue=86|last=Browne|first=David}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The World of DJs and the Turntable Culture|last=Souvignier|first=Todd|isbn=978-0-634-05833-2|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2004|pages=41–42}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://downlode.org/Etext/negativland_shiny.html|title=Shiny, Aluminum, Plastic, and Digital|author=[[Negativland]]|website=Downlode.org|accessdate=6 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Romancing the Record: The Vinyl De-Evolution and Subcultural Evolution|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|volume=26|issue=1|page=110,112|last=Plasketes|first=George|year=1992|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1992.00109.x}}</ref>
But ever since 2007, the popularity of vinyl records has risen again. The largest online retailer of vinyl records in 2014 was Amazon with a 12.3% market share, while the largest physical retailer of vinyl records was [[Urban Outfitters]] with an 8.1% market share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/6266616/urban-outfitters-doesnt-sell-most-vinyl|title=Urban Outfitters Doesn't Sell the Most Vinyl|publisher=''Billboard''|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>

In its 'Shipment and Revenue Statistics' report for 2016, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] noted that "Shipments of vinyl albums were up 4% to $430 million, and comprised 26% of total physical shipments at retail value – their highest share since 1985".<ref name="RIAA 2016">{{cite web |url= https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RIAA-2016-Year-End-News-Notes.pdf|title= News and Notes on 2016 RIAA Shipment and Revenue Statistics |last= Friedlander| first= Joshua P.|date= |website= riaa.com| publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]] | accessdate= 31 August 2017 }}</ref>

===In the United Kingdom===
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity in the late 1980s. This started a gradual decline in vinyl record sales throughout the 1990s. But also in the United Kingdom has the number of sold vinyl LP records increased every year between 2007 and 2014 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11529159/Vinyl-revival-LPs-to-get-their-own-official-chart.html|title=Vinyl revival: LPs to get their own official chart|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> In December 2011, [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] began an occasional ''Vinyl Revival'' series in which [[Peter Paphides]] met musicians who revealed, and played selections from, their personal vinyl record collections.<ref name="BBC Radio 6 Music">{{cite episode| title= Vinyl Revival: Damon Albarn: Series 1 Episode 1 of 8| series= Vinyl Reviva| serieslink= | credits= Presenter: [[Peter Paphides]]| network= [[BBC]]| station= [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017xc8p| airdate= 4 December 2011| accessdate= 13 October 2017 }}</ref> In November 2014, it was reported that over one million vinyl records had been sold in the UK since the beginning of the year. Sales had not reached this level since 1996. The [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) predicted that Christmas sales would bring the total for the year to around 1.2 million. However, vinyl sales were still a very small proportion of total music sales. [[Pink Floyd]]’s ''[[The Endless River]]'' became the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 – and the fastest-selling since 1997 – despite selling only 6,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web |last= Lee |first= Dave |title=Vinyl record sales hit 18-year high|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30216638|accessdate=27 November 2014 |website=BBC News | date=27 November 2014 }}</ref> In 2016, 3.2 million vinyl records were sold in the UK, the best sale for a quarter of a century.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/03/record-sales-vinyl-hits-25-year-high-and-outstrips-streaming The Guardian, January 2017]</ref>

As of 2016, the revival continued.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/16/vinyl-sales-record-store-day/|title=Vinyl Sales Are Not Just a Hipster Thing Anymore|first=Chris|last=Morris|website=Fortune|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> In January 2017, the BPI's 'Official UK recorded music market report for 2016', using [[Official Charts Company]] data, noted that "Though still niche in terms of its size within the overall recorded music market, vinyl enjoyed another stellar year, with over 3.2 million LPs sold – a 53 per cent rise on last year".<ref name="BPI 2016">{{cite web |url= http://www.bpi.co.uk/searchresult/bpi-official-uk-recorded-music-market-report-for-2016.aspx|title= BPI official UK recorded music market report for 2016|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 3 January 2017 |website= www.bpi.co.uk |publisher= [[British Phonographic Institute]] | accessdate= 1 September 2017 }}</ref> The BPI also reported that "The biggest-selling vinyl artist was David Bowie, with 5 albums posthumously featuring in the top-30 best-sellers, including his Mercury Prize shortlisted ''Blackstar'', which was 2016’s most popular vinyl recording ahead of Amy Winehouse’s ''Back To Black'', selling more than double the number of copies of 2015’s best seller on vinyl – Adele’s ''25''".<ref name="BPI 2016"/>

BBC Radio 4's ''[[Front Row (radio)|Front Row]]'' discussed the increase in coloured vinyl releases in October 2017 in the wake of recent albums in the format by [[Beck]], [[Liam Gallagher]], and [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]].<ref name="BBC Front Row 13 October 2017">{{cite episode| title= Kit Harington, Kele Okereke, Dynasty, Porridge | series= [[Front Row (radio)|Front Row]] | credits= Presenters: Presenter: [[Stig Abell]]; Producer: Timothy Prosser| network= BBC| station= [[BBC Radio 4]]| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0977v8d | airdate= 13 October 2017| minutes= 24:40| accessdate= 13 October 2017 }}</ref>
