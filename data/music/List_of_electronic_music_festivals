The following is an incomplete '''list of music festivals that feature electronic music''', which encapsulates music featuring [[electronic instruments]] such as [[electric guitar]] and [[keyboards]], as well as recent genres such as [[electronic dance music]] (EDM). Many of the festivals in this list take place in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], though every year thousands of electronic-focused music festivals are held throughout the world. This list generally excludes multi-genre festivals with only a partial focus on electronic music ([[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[Summer Sonic Festival]], and [[Big Day Out]]) and festivals that have added EDM stages in later years.<ref name=noisey-chicago>{{cite web|title=House Music Comes Home: How Chicago's Summer of Music Festivals Has Reinvigorated the City's Dance Spirit|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/blog/house-music-comes-home-how-chicagos-summer-of-music-festivals-has-reinvigorated-the-citys-dance-spirit|website=Noisey|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]}}</ref><ref name=lvweekly-edmfeverpitch>{{cite web|title=How Coachella's final day symbolizes the electronic music fever pitch|url=http://www.lvweekly.com/ae/music/2014/apr/14/how-coachellas-final-day-symbolizes-electronic-mus/|website=Las Vegas Weekly|accessdate=2014-12-09}}</ref> However, fusion festivals may be listed under individual subtopics of '''[[:Category:Electronic music festivals by country]]'''.

Since the early 1900s there have been music festivals that featured electronic instruments, as electronic sounds were used in [[experimental music]] such as [[electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] and [[tape music]]. The use of [[live electronic music]] greatly expanded in the 1950s, along with the use of [[electric guitar]] and bass. With the advent of new technologies in the 1960s, electronic genres such as [[electronic rock]], [[electronic jazz]], [[disco]], [[computer music]], [[synthpop]], [[psychedelic rock]] and [[ambient music]] followed, with large [[free festival]]s showcasing the sounds into the 1970s. There has been a significant change in the capabilities of [[amplifiers]], [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]s, and mixing [[synthesizers]] since 1980, as well as computers and [[digital audio workstations]]. This has given electronic musicians and DJs the ability to mix elaborate and complicated music in forms such as [[techno]], [[electronica]], [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]], [[trance music|trance]], [[house music|house]], and [[industrial music|industrial]], all of which have large festivals, [[rave]]s, [[technoparade]]s, [[algorave]]s, [[doof]]s, or [[teknival]]s in their sole dedication.
