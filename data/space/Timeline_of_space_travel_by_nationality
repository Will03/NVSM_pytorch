[[File:Astronaut Nationalities.svg|thumb|260px|Map of countries (and successor states) whose citizens have flown in space as of September 2015. <br> Note: citizens from the now-defunct East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Soviet Union have also flown in space.]]

Since the first [[human spaceflight]] by the [[Soviet Union]], citizens of 40 countries have flown in space. For each nationality, the launch date of the first mission is listed. The list is based on the nationality of the person at the time of the launch. Only 3 of the 40 "first flyers" have been women ([[Helen Sharman]] for the United Kingdom in 1991, [[Anousheh Ansari]] for Iran in 2006, and [[Yi So-yeon]] for South Korea in 2008). Only three nations (Soviet Union/Russia, U.S., China) have launched their own manned spacecraft, with the Soviets/Russians and the American programs providing rides to other nations' astronauts. Twenty-six "first flights" occurred on Soviet or Russian flights while the United States carried thirteen.

==Notes==
# {{note label|SovietUnion|}} The first cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, held [[citizenship]] in both the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Russian SFSR]], according to the applicable provisions of the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]].  In 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved, and was replaced by [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Estonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. At the time of the dissolution, [[Sergei Krikalev]] and [[Alexander Alexandrovich Volkov (cosmonaut)|Alexander Volkov]] were orbiting [[Earth]] on [[Mir]], having been launched into orbit as [[Soviet citizen]]s, and having returned to the Earth as [[Russian citizenship|Russian citizens]].  Kaleri and Viktorenko were the first Russians to be launched into orbit as Russian citizens only, their launch having occurred subsequent to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
# {{note label|SovietUnion|}} Under [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] rules, the Vostok missions are not deemed true spaceflights, as cosmonauts did not land with the spacecraft (they ejected from the spacecraft and landed separately).  The first Soviet mission that did fulfill this requirement was [[Voskhod 1]]. (Reference: {{cite web | title=FAI Astronautic Records Commission – Sporting Code Section 8 | format=PDF | work=Fédération Aéronautique Internationale | url=http://www.fai.org/sporting_code/sc08.pdf | accessdate=2006-04-09 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526002647/http://www.fai.org/sporting_code/sc08.pdf | archivedate=2006-05-26 | df= }}) However, despite this issue, the FAI does recognize [[Yuri Gagarin]] as the first ''person'' to complete a spaceflight. (Reference: {{cite web | title=FAI Award: The Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal | work=Fédération Aéronautique Internationale | url=http://www.fai.org/awards/award.asp?id=9 | accessdate=2007-10-10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013163823/http://www.fai.org/awards/award.asp?id=9 | archivedate=2007-10-13 | df= }})
# {{note label|UnitedStates|}} Shepard's spaceflight was suborbital.  The first [[United States|American]] to be launched into Earth orbit was [[John Glenn]], on 20 February 1962.
# {{note label|Czechoslovakia|}} In 1993, [[Czechoslovakia]] dissolved and was replaced by the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]].
# {{note label|Germany|}} In 1978, both Jähn himself and the [[German Democratic Republic]] pronounced him the "first [[Germans|German]] in space", rather than the first "citizen of the German Democratic Republic in space". In 1990, the states of the former East Germany acceded to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. On 22 January 1992, Ulf Merbold again traveled into space, now representing the [[German reunification|reunited Germany within the Federal Republic of Germany]]. Jähn is, nevertheless, still considered the first German in space, even in the states of the Federal Republic of Germany that comprised the former West Germany.
# {{note label|SpaceTourists|}} This person flew as a commercial, non-governmental space traveller. Apart from Akiyama and Sharman, these space travellers are known as [[space tourist]]s.
# {{note label|Israel|}} Ilan Ramon was the first Israeli to go into space, but Ramon died during reentry during the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]]. Again, this was not deemed a complete spaceflight under FAI rules.
# {{note label|Ansari|}} Although recognized as an Iranian citizen by Iranian law, Ansari is also an American citizen and was prohibited from wearing Iranian state symbols by both the United States and Russian governments.
