'''David Elieser Deutsch''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}}<ref name=frs/> ({{IPAc-en|d|ɔɪ|tʃ}}; born 18 May 1953)<ref name=whoswho/> is an Israeli-born British [[physicist]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He is a Visiting Professor in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the [[Centre for Quantum Computation]] (CQC) in the [[Clarendon Laboratory]] of the University of Oxford. He pioneered the field of [[quantum computation]] by formulating a description for a [[quantum Turing machine]], as well as specifying an algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer.<ref name=Deutsch1985>

Deutsch has expounded a new criterion for scientific explanation, which is to formulate invariants: 'State an explanation [publicly, so that it can be dated and verified by others later] that  remains invariant [in the face of apparent change, new information, or unexpected conditions]'.<ref name=TED>[https://www.ted.com/talks/david_deutsch_a_new_way_to_explain_explanation David Deutsch (October 2009) "A new way to explain explanation" ''TED talk'']

==Early life and education==
Deutsch was born in [[Haifa]] in Israel on 18 May 1953, the son of Oskar and Tikva Deutsch. He attended [[William Ellis School]] in [[Highgate]], north London (then a [[voluntary aided school|voluntary aided]] [[grammar school]]) before reading [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|Natural Sciences]] at [[Clare College, Cambridge]] and taking [[Part III of the Mathematical Tripos]]. He went on to [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] for his doctorate in [[theoretical physics]]<ref name=dphd>{{cite thesis|first=David Elieser|last=Deutsch|url=http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/OXVU1:LSCOP_OX:oxfaleph020621138|website=bodleian.ox.ac.uk|publisher=University of Oxford|year=1978|title=Boundary effects in quantum field theory|degree=DPhil|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.453518}}}}</ref> and wrote his thesis on [[quantum field theory]] in [[curved space-time]]<ref name=whoswho/><ref name=peach/> supervised by [[Dennis Sciama]]<ref name=mathgene/> and [[Philip Candelas]].<ref name=dphd/><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=David|last2=Candelas|first2=Philip|year=1979|title=Boundary effects in quantum field theory|journal=[[Physical Review]] D|volume=20|issue=12|pages=3063–3080|doi=10.1103/physrevd.20.3063|via=|bibcode=1979PhRvD..20.3063D}}</ref>

==Career and research==
His work on [[quantum algorithms]] began with a ground-breaking 1985 paper,<ref name=Deutsch1985/> later expanded in 1992 along with [[Richard Jozsa]] to produce the [[Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm]], one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic classical algorithm.

Together with Chiara Marletto, he published a paper in December 2014 entitled ''Constructor theory of information'',<ref name=DeutschMarletto2014>{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=D.|last2=Marletto|first2=C.|title=Constructor theory of information|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=471|issue=2174|year=2014|pages=20140540–20140540|issn=1364-5021|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0540|pmid=25663803|pmc=4309123 |arxiv=1405.5563|bibcode=2014RSPSA.47140540D}} {{open access}}</ref> that conjectures that information can be expressed solely in terms of which transformations of physical systems are possible and which are impossible.

<blockquote>... laid the foundations of the quantum theory of computation, and has subsequently made or participated in many of the most important advances in the field, including the discovery of the first quantum algorithms, the theory of quantum logic gates and quantum computational networks, the first quantum error-correction scheme, and several fundamental quantum universality results. He has set the agenda for worldwide research efforts in this new, interdisciplinary field, made progress in understanding its philosophical implications (via a variant of the many-universes interpretation) and made it comprehensible to the general public, notably in his book The Fabric of Reality.</blockquote>

In 1996 he appeared in the BBC ''[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]]'' programme.<ref name=imdb>{{IMDb name|id=2396284}}</ref>

===''The Fabric of Reality''===
{{Main article|The Fabric of Reality}}

In his 1997 book ''The Fabric of Reality'', Deutsch details his "Theory of Everything." It aims not at the reduction of everything to particle physics, but rather mutual support among [[multiversal]], computational, epistemological, and evolutionary principles. His theory of everything is somewhat [[emergence|emergentist]] rather than [[reductionism|reductive]]. There are four strands to his theory:

# [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]], "the first and most important of the four strands."
# [[Karl Popper]]'s [[epistemology]], especially its anti-inductivism and requiring a [[scientific realism|realist]] (non-instrumental) interpretation of scientific theories, as well as its emphasis on taking seriously those bold conjectures that resist falsification.
# [[Alan Turing]]'s theory of computation, especially as developed in Deutsch's [[Turing principle]], in which the [[Universal Turing machine]] is replaced by Deutsch's [[universal quantum computer]]. ("''The'' theory of computation is now the quantum theory of computation.")
# [[Richard Dawkins]]'s refinement of [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolutionary theory and the [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|modern evolutionary synthesis]], especially the ideas of replicator and meme as they integrate with Popperian problem-solving (the [[epistemological]] strand).

===''The Beginning of Infinity''===
{{Main article|The Beginning of Infinity }}

Deutsch's second book, ''The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the World'', was published on 31 March 2011. In this book Deutsch views the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the 18th century as near the beginning of a potentially  unending sequence of purposeful knowledge creation. He examines the nature of [[meme]]s and how and why [[creativity]] evolved in humans.<ref>{{TED speaker}}</ref>
