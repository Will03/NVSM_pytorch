'''Astrobotic Technology''' is an American [[privately held company]] that is [[new product development|developing]] [[space robotics]] technology for lunar and planetary missions. It was founded in 2008 by [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]] professor [[Red Whittaker]] and his associates, with the goal of winning the [[Google Lunar X Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Astrobotic Technology and Raytheon Collaborate to Pursue Google Lunar X Prize|url=http://www.lunarexplorers.net/node/386|publisher=lunarexplorers.net|accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> The company is based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].

The first launch of one of its spacecraft, the ''Peregrine'' lunar lander, is expected to take place in 2020 on an [[Atlas V]] rocket.
 
== History ==

The team stated an ambitious goal from the start in 2008: to be the first commercial operation to land their ''Red Rover'' on the [[Moon]], using their ''Artemis Lander''.<ref name=msnbc20080222>
{{cite web |title=Private race to the moon (and money) takes off |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23278871/page/2/ |publisher=msnbc.com |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2011-02-08 |quote=''Astrobotic: Headed by William 'Red' Whittaker of Carnegie Mellon University, the team expects their 'Artemis Lander' and 'Red Rover' spacecraft to touch down first on the moon.''}}</ref> The company's first running prototype of ''Red Rover'' was completed the same year, and the concept lander was renamed ''Griffin''.

On 28 July 2008, [[NASA]] awarded Astrobotic funding for a concept study on "regolith moving methods",<ref>{{cite web| title=NASA Awards Contracts for Concepts of Lunar Surface Systems| url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jul/HQ_C0848_Lunar_surface_contract_prt.htm|publisher=NASA| accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> and the next year, Astrobotic began to receive Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding from NASA totaling over $795,000 to investigate prospecting for lunar resources,<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA Contract to Astrobotic Technology Investigates Prospecting for Lunar Resources |url=http://astrobotic.net/2012/04/23/nasa-contract-to-astrobotic-technology-investigates-prospecting-for-lunar-resources/ |publisher=Astrobotic |accessdate=9 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630152324/http://astrobotic.net/2012/04/23/nasa-contract-to-astrobotic-technology-investigates-prospecting-for-lunar-resources/ |archivedate=30 June 2012 |df= }}</ref> which eventually led to a concept called ''Polar Excavator''.

On 15 October 2010, NASA awarded a contract to Astrobotic for Innovative Lunar Demonstrations Data (ILDD) firm-fixed price indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contracts with a total value up to $30.1 million over a period of up to five years, and in December, NASA's $500,000 ILDD project for further Lunar Demonstrations Data was awarded to Astrobotic.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA Selects Companies for Further Lunar Demonstrations Data|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/dec/HQ_10-344_ILDD_Selections_prt.htm|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref>

''Peregrine''{{'s}} bus structure is mainly manufactured out of aluminum alloy, and it is reconfigurable for specific missions.

Its electrical systems will be powered by a lithium-ion battery that is recharged by a [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panel]] made of GaInP/GaAs/Ge.
