The '''conformal cyclic cosmology''' ('''CCC''') is a [[cosmological model]] in the framework of [[general relativity]], advanced by the theoretical physicists [[Roger Penrose]] and [[Vahe Gurzadyan]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Cosmos may show echoes of events before Big Bang |first=Jason |last=Palmer |date=2010-11-27 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11837869|accessdate=2010-11-27|newspaper=BBC News }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e06/PAPERS/THESPA01.PDF |title=Before the big bang: An outrageous new perspective and its implications for particle physics |first=Roger |last=Penrose |date=June 2006 |accessdate=2010-11-27 |location=Edinburgh, Scotland |pages=2759–2767 |publisher=Proceedings of EPAC 2006}}</ref><ref name="arxiv.org">{{cite journal |last1=Gurzadyan |first1=VG |last2=Penrose |first2=R |year=2013 |title=On CCC-predicted concentric low-variance circles in the CMB sky |journal=Eur.

In CCC, the universe iterates through infinite cycles, with the future [[Penrose diagram|timelike infinity]] of each previous iteration being identified with the [[Big Bang]] singularity of the next.<ref>{{cite web |title=Penrose claims to have glimpsed universe before Big Bang |first=Edwin |last=Cartlidge |publisher=physicsworld.com |date=2010-11-19 |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/44388|accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref> Penrose popularized this theory in his 2010 book [[Cycles of Time (book)|''Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe'']].

== Basic construction ==
Penrose's basic construction<ref name="epac2006">{{cite journal|author=Roger Penrose |title=Before the Big Bang: An Outrageous New Perspective and its Implications for Particle Physics|year=2006|journal=Proceedings of the EPAC 2006, Edinburgh, Scotland|url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e06/PAPERS/THESPA01.PDF|pages=2759–2762}}</ref> is to connect a [[countable]] sequence of open [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW) spacetimes, each representing a [[big bang]] followed by an infinite future expansion. Penrose noticed that the past [[conformal boundary]] of one copy of FLRW spacetime can be "attached" to the future conformal boundary of another, after an appropriate [[conformal map|conformal rescaling]]. In particular, each individual FLRW metric <math>g_{ab}</math> is multiplied by the square of a conformal factor <math>\Omega</math> that approaches zero at [[Penrose diagram|timelike infinity]], effectively "squashing down" the future conformal boundary to a conformally regular [[hypersurface]] (which is [[Spacelike#Spacetime intervals|spacelike]] if there is a positive [[cosmological constant]], as is currently believed). The result is a new solution to Einstein's equations, which Penrose takes to represent the entire universe, and which is composed of a sequence of sectors that Penrose calls "aeons".

== Physical implications ==
The significant feature of this construction for particle physics is that, since [[boson]]s obey the laws of [[Conformal field theory|conformally invariant quantum theory]], they will behave in the same way in the rescaled aeons as in their former FLRW counterparts (classically, this corresponds to light-cone structures being preserved under conformal rescaling). For such particles, the boundary between aeons is not a boundary at all, but just a spacelike surface that can be passed across like any other. [[Fermions]], on the other hand, remain confined to a given aeon, thus providing a convenient solution to the [[black hole information paradox]]; according to Penrose, fermions must be irreversibly converted into radiation during black hole evaporation, to preserve the smoothness of the boundary between aeons.

The curvature properties of Penrose's cosmology are also convenient for other aspects of cosmology. First, the boundary between aeons satisfies the [[Weyl curvature hypothesis]], thus providing a certain kind of low-entropy past as required by statistical mechanics and by observation. Second, Penrose has calculated that a certain amount of gravitational radiation should be preserved across the boundary between aeons. Penrose suggests this extra gravitational radiation may be enough to explain the observed [[cosmic acceleration]] without appeal to a [[dark energy]] matter field.

== Empirical tests ==
In 2010, Penrose and [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] published a [[preprint]] of a paper claiming that observations of the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) made by the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) and the [[BOOMERanG experiment]] contained an excess of concentric circles compared to simulations based on the standard [[Lambda-CDM model]] of cosmology, quoting a 6-sigma significance of the result.<ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=1011.3706 |author1=Gurzadyan VG |author2=Penrose R |title=Concentric circles in WMAP data may provide evidence of violent pre-Big-Bang activity |date=2010-11-16|class=astro-ph.CO }}</ref> However, the statistical significance of the claimed detection has since been disputed. Three groups have independently attempted to reproduce these results, but found that the detection of the concentric anomalies was not statistically significant, in that no more concentric circles appeared in the data than in Lambda-CDM simulations.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1012.1268 |author1=Wehus IK |author2=Eriksen HK |title=A search for concentric circles in the 7-year WMAP temperature sky maps |date=2010-12-07 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/733/2/L29 |volume=733 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |page=L29|bibcode = 2011ApJ...733L..29W }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1012.1305 |author1=Moss A |author2=Scott D |author3=Zibin JP |title=No evidence for anomalously low variance circles on the sky |date=2010-12-07 |doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2011/04/033 |volume=2011 |issue=4 |journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics |page=033|bibcode = 2011JCAP...04..033M }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1012.1656 |author1=Hajian A |title=Are There Echoes From The Pre-Big Bang Universe?

The reason for the disagreement was tracked down to an issue of how to construct the simulations that are used to determine the significance: The three independent attempts to repeat the analysis all used simulations based on the standard Lambda-CDM model, while Penrose and Gurzadyan used an undocumented non-standard approach.<ref>{{cite arXiv|eprint=1012.1486|title=More on the low variance circles in CMB sky|author1=Gurzadyan VG |author2=Penrose R |class=astro-ph.CO |date=2010-12-07}}</ref>

In 2013 Gurzadyan and Penrose published the further development of their work introducing a new method they termed the "sky-twist procedure" (not based on simulations) in which WMAP data is directly analysed;<ref name="arxiv.org"/> in 2015, they published the results of Planck data analysis confirming those of WMAP, including the inhomogeneous sky distribution of those structures.<ref name="CCC and the Fermi paradox">{{cite journal | last1 = Gurzadyan | first1 = V.G. | last2 = Penrose | first2 = R. | year = 2016 | title = CCC and the Fermi paradox | url = | journal = Eur.

In a paper published on August 6th, 2018 Daniel An, [[Krzysztof Antoni Meissner]], Pawel Nurowski and Penrose presented a continued analysis of the CMB data as it seemed to them that “…anomalous points provide an important new input to cosmology, irrespective of the validity of CCC.” They also suggest that those anomalies could be what in CCC are [[Stephen Hawking|Hawking]] points i.e. remnant signals from “…[[Hawking evaporation]] of supermassive black holes in the aeon prior to ours” and claim that a [[B modes|B-mode]] location found by the [[BICEP2]] team is exactly at one of these Hawking point as predicted by CCC.<ref>{{cite arxiv |eprint=1808.01740|last1=Gurzadyan|first1=V.

== CCC and the Fermi paradox ==
In 2015 Gurzadyan and Penrose also discussed the [[Fermi paradox]], the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence but high probability estimates for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. Within conformal cyclic cosmology, the cosmic microwave background provides the possibility of information transfer from one aeon to another, including of intelligent signals within [[information panspermia]] concept.<ref name="CCC and the Fermi paradox"/>
