A '''Mars rover''' is a [[motor vehicle]] that propels itself across the surface of the planet [[Mars]] upon arrival. [[Rover (space exploration)|Rovers]] have several advantages over stationary [[Lander (spacecraft)|landers]]: they examine more territory, and they can be directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote [[robot]]ic vehicle control.

There have been four successful robotically operated Mars rovers. The [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] managed the ''[[Sojourner (rover)|Sojourner]]'' rover, the [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'']] rover, ''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' rover, and, now  the ''[[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]]'' rover. On January 24, 2016 NASA reported that [[Timeline of Mars Science Laboratory#Current status|current studies]] on Mars by the ''Curiosity'' and ''Opportunity'' rovers would be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a [[biosphere]] based on [[autotroph]]ic, [[chemotroph]]ic or [[Lithotroph#Chemolithotrophs|chemolithoautotrophic]] [[microorganism]]s, as well as ancient water, including [[Lacustrine plain|fluvio-lacustrine environments]] ([[plain]]s related to ancient [[river]]s or [[lake]]s) that may have been [[Planetary habitability|habitable]].<ref name="SCI-20140124a">{{cite journal |last=Grotzinger |first=John P. |title=Introduction to Special Issue - Habitability, Taphonomy, and the Search for Organic Carbon on Mars |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/386 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=January 24, 2014 |volume=343 |number=6169 |pages=386–387 |doi=10.1126/science.1249944 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |pmid=24458635|bibcode = 2014Sci...343..386G }}</ref><ref name="SCI-20140124special">{{cite journal |authors=Various |title=Special Issue - Table of Contents - Exploring Martian Habitability |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169.toc#SpecialIssue |date=January 24, 2014|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=343 |number=6169 |pages=345–452 |accessdate=24 January 2014 }}</ref><ref name="SCI-20140124">{{cite journal |authors=Various |title=Special Collection - Curiosity - Exploring Martian Habitability |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/extra/curiosity/|date=January 24, 2014 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |accessdate=January 24, 2014 }}</ref><ref name="SCI-20140124c">{{cite journal |authors=Grotzinger, J.P. |title=A Habitable Fluvio-Lacustrine Environment at Yellowknife Bay, Gale Crater, Mars |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/1242777 |date=January 24, 2014 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=343 |number=6169 |doi=10.1126/science.1242777 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |display-authors=etal |pmid=24324272 |pages=1242777|bibcode = 2014Sci...343A.386G }}</ref> The search for evidence of [[Planetary habitability|habitability]], [[taphonomy]] (related to [[fossils]]), and [[organic carbon]] on Mars is now a primary NASA objective.<ref name="SCI-20140124a" /> Since June 2018, the ''Opportunity'' rover has been out of contact after going into hibernation mode in a dust storm. NASA has stated they are unsure if they will ever be able to regain contact.

[[Mars 2]], [[Mars 3]] were physically tethered probes; ''Sojourner'' was dependent on the Mars Pathfinder base station for communication with Earth; MER-A & B and ''Curiosity'' were on their own. Of these ''Curiosity'' is still active, and  ''Spirit'', ''Opportunity'' and ''Sojourner'' completed their missions before losing contact.

==NASA Mars rover goals (circa 2010s)==
<!---[[File:MarsPanoramaa.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Panorama of Husband Hill taken by MER-A ''[[Spirit Rover]]'', November 23–28, 2005.]]--->
NASA distinguishes between "mission" objectives and "science" objectives. Mission objectives are related to progress in [[space technology]] and development processes. Science objectives are met by the instruments during their mission in space.

The details of rover science vary according to equipment carried. The primary goal of the ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' rovers is to discover
"the history of water on Mars".<ref>{{Cite web
|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/overview/
|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Overview
|publisher=marsrovers.nasa.gov
|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> The presence of accessible water would greatly reduce a crewed mission cost.

The four science goals of NASA's long-term Mars Exploration Program are:
* Determine whether life ever arose on Mars
* Characterize the [[climate of Mars]]
* Characterize the [[geology of Mars]]
* Prepare for [[human exploration of Mars]]<ref>
