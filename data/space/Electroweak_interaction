In [[particle physics]], the '''electroweak interaction''' is the [[unified field theory|unified description]] of two of the four known  [[fundamental interaction]]s of nature: [[electromagnetism]] and the [[weak interaction]]. Although these two forces appear very different at everyday low energies, the theory models them as two different aspects of the same force. Above the [[electroweak scale|unification energy]], on the order of 246&nbsp;[[GeV]]<!-- IF THIS IS CHANGED, PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE SAME INFO AT [[Chronology of the universe]], [[Electroweak scale]], [[Electroweak epoch]]. THANK YOU. -->,<ref group=lower-alpha>The particular number 246&nbsp;GeV is taken to be the [[vacuum expectation value]] <math>v = (G_F \sqrt{2})^{-1/2}</math> of the [[Higgs field]] (where <math>G_F</math> is the [[Fermi coupling constant]]).</ref>{{verify source|date=March 2018}} they would merge into a single '''electroweak force'''. Thus, if the universe is hot enough (approximately 10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], a temperature not exceeded since shortly after the [[Big Bang]]), then the electromagnetic force and weak force merge into a combined electroweak force. During the [[quark epoch]], the electroweak force split into the electromagnetic and [[weak force]].

In 1999, [[Gerardus 't Hooft]] and [[Martinus Veltman]] were awarded the Nobel prize for showing that the electroweak theory is [[renormalizable]].

Three components of the Higgs field become part of the massive ''W'' and ''Z'' bosons.]]

Mathematically, the unification is accomplished under an [[SU(2)|''SU''(2)]] &times; [[Unitary_group|''U''(1)]] [[gauge theory|gauge group]]. The corresponding [[gauge boson]]s are the '''three''' W bosons of [[weak isospin]] from ''SU(2)'' (''W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>'', and ''W<sub>3</sub>''), and the ''B'' boson of [[weak hypercharge]] from ''U(1)'', respectively, all of which are massless.

In the [[Standard Model]], the [[W and Z bosons|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson+-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0}} bosons]], and the [[photon]], are produced by the [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] of the '''electroweak symmetry''' from ''SU''(2) × ''U''(1)<sub>''Y''</sub> to ''U''(1)<sub>em</sub>, caused by the [[Higgs mechanism]] (see also [[Higgs boson]]).<ref>

The spontaneous symmetry breaking  makes the {{mvar|W}}<sub>3</sub> and {{mvar|B}} bosons coalesce  into two different bosons – the {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0}} boson, and the photon ({{mvar|γ}}),
: <math> \begin{pmatrix}
\gamma \\
Z^0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos \theta_W & \sin \theta_W \\
-\sin \theta_W & \cos \theta_W \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
B \\
W_3 \end{pmatrix} </math>

where {{math|''θ<sub>W</sub>''}} is the ''[[weak mixing angle]]''. The axes representing the particles have essentially just been rotated, in the (''W''<sub>3</sub>, ''B'') plane, by the angle {{math|''θ<sub>W</sub>''}}. This also introduces a  mismatch between the mass of the {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0}} and the mass of the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+-}} particles (denoted as {{math|''M<sub>Z</sub>''}} and {{math|''M<sub>W</sub>''}}, respectively),
:<math>M_Z=\frac{M_W}{\cos\theta_W}.</math>

The {{math|''W<sub>1</sub>''}} and {{math|''W<sub>2</sub>''}} bosons, in turn, combine to give massive charged bosons
:<math>W^{\pm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(W_1\mp i W_2).</math>

The distinction between electromagnetism and the weak force arises because there is a (nontrivial) linear combination of ''Y'' and ''T''<sub>3</sub> that vanishes for the [[Higgs boson]] (it is an eigenstate of both ''Y'' and ''T''<sub>3</sub>, so the coefficients may be taken as &minus;''T''<sub>3</sub> and ''Y''):  ''U''(1)<sub>em</sub> is defined to be the group generated by this linear combination, and is unbroken because it does not interact with the Higgs.

==Lagrangian==

===Before electroweak symmetry breaking===
The [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] for the electroweak interactions is divided into four parts before [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] becomes manifest,
:<math>\mathcal{L}_{\text{EW}} = \mathcal{L}_g + \mathcal{L}_f + \mathcal{L}_h + \mathcal{L}_y~.</math>

The <math>\mathcal{L}_g</math> term describes the interaction between the three {{mvar|W}}  vector bosons and the {{mvar|B}} vector boson, 
:<math>\mathcal{L}_g = -\tfrac{1}{4} W_{a}^{\mu\nu}W_{\mu\nu}^a - \tfrac{1}{4} B^{\mu\nu}B_{\mu\nu}</math>,
where <math>W^{a\mu\nu}</math> (<math>a=1,2,3</math>) and <math>B^{\mu\nu}</math> are the [[field strength tensor]]s for the weak isospin and weak hypercharge gauge fields.

<math>\mathcal{L}_f</math> is the kinetic term for the Standard Model fermions. The interaction of the gauge bosons and the fermions are through the [[gauge covariant derivative]],
:<math>\mathcal{L}_f =   \overline{Q}_i iD\!\!\!\!/\; Q_i+ \overline{u}_i iD\!\!\!\!/\; u_i+ \overline{d}_i iD\!\!\!\!/\; d_i+ \overline{L}_i iD\!\!\!\!/\; L_i+ \overline{e}_i iD\!\!\!\!/\; e_i </math>,
where the subscript {{mvar|i}} runs over the three generations of fermions; {{mvar|Q}}, {{mvar|u}}, and {{mvar|d}} are the left-handed doublet, right-handed singlet up, and right handed singlet down quark fields; and {{mvar|L}} and {{mvar|e}} are the left-handed doublet and right-handed singlet electron fields.

The {{mvar|h}} term describes the Higgs field  and its interactions with itself and the gauge bosons,
:<math>\mathcal{L}_h = |D_\mu h|^2 - \lambda \left(|h|^2 - \frac{v^2}{2}\right)^2</math>

The {{mvar|y}} term displays the [[Yukawa interaction]] with the fermions, 
:<math>\mathcal{L}_y = - y_{u\, ij} \epsilon^{ab} \,h_b^\dagger\, \overline{Q}_{ia} u_j^c - y_{d\, ij}\, h\, \overline{Q}_i d^c_j - y_{e\,ij} \,h\, \overline{L}_i e^c_j + h.c. ~,</math>
and generates their masses,  manifest when the Higgs field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value, discussed next.

===After electroweak symmetry breaking===
The Lagrangian reorganizes itself  as the Higgs boson acquires a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value dictated by the potential of the previous section. As a result of this rewriting, the symmetry breaking becomes manifest. 

Due to its complexity, this Lagrangian is best described by breaking it up into several parts as follows.
:<math>\mathcal{L}_{\text{EW}} = \mathcal{L}_\text{K} + \mathcal{L}_\text{N} + \mathcal{L}_\text{C} + \mathcal{L}_\text{H} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{HV}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{WWV}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{WWVV}} + \mathcal{L}_\text{Y}.</math>

The kinetic term <math>\mathcal{L}_K</math> contains all the quadratic terms of the Lagrangian, which include the dynamic terms (the partial derivatives) and the mass terms (conspicuously absent from the Lagrangian before symmetry breaking)
:<math> 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\text{K} = \sum_f \overline{f}(i\partial\!\!\!/\!\;-m_f)f-\frac14A_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu\nu}-\frac12W^+_{\mu\nu}W^{-\mu\nu}+m_W^2W^+_\mu W^{-\mu} 
\\
\qquad -\frac14Z_{\mu\nu}Z^{\mu\nu}+\frac12m_Z^2Z_\mu Z^\mu+\frac12(\partial^\mu H)(\partial_\mu H)-\frac12m_H^2H^2  ~,
\end{align}
</math>
where the sum runs over all the fermions of the theory (quarks and leptons), and the fields <math>A_{\mu\nu}^{}</math>, <math>Z_{\mu\nu}^{}</math>, <math>W^-_{\mu\nu}</math>, and <math>W^+_{\mu\nu}\equiv(W^-_{\mu\nu})^\dagger</math>  are given as
:<math>X^{a}_{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu X^{a}_\nu - \partial_\nu X^{a}_\mu + g f^{abc}X^{b}_{\mu}X^{c}_{\nu} ~,</math> 
with {{mvar|X}} to be  replaced by the relevant field, and  {{math|''f  <sup>abc</sup>''}} by the structure constants of the appropriate gauge group.

The neutral current <math>\mathcal{L}_\text{N}</math> and charged current <math>\mathcal{L}_\text{C}</math> components of the Lagrangian contain the interactions between the fermions and gauge bosons,
:<math>\mathcal{L}_{\text{N}} = e J_\mu^{\text{em}} A^\mu + \frac g{\cos\theta_W}(J_\mu^3-\sin^2\theta_WJ_\mu^{\text{em}})Z^\mu</math>,
where {{mvar|e}}={{math| ''g'' sin ''θ<sub>W</sub>''}}= {{math| ''g' '' cos ''θ<sub>W</sub>''}}; while the  electromagnetic current <math>J_\mu^{\text{em}}</math> and the neutral weak current <math>J_\mu^3</math> are
:<math>J_\mu^{\text{em}} = \sum_f q_f\overline{f}\gamma_\mu f</math>,
and
:<math>J_\mu^3 = \sum_f I^3_f\overline{f} \gamma_\mu\frac{1-\gamma^5}{2}  f</math>
where <math>q_f^{}</math> and <math>I_f^3</math> are the fermions' electric charges and weak isospin.

The charged current part of the Lagrangian is given by
:<math>\mathcal{L}_\text{C} = -\frac g{\sqrt2}\left[\overline u_i\gamma^\mu\frac{1-\gamma^5}2M^{\text{CKM}}_{ij}d_j+\overline\nu_i\gamma^\mu\frac{1-\gamma^5}2e_i\right]W_\mu^+ +\text{h.c.} ~,</math>
where <math>\mathcal{L}_\text{H}</math> contains the Higgs three-point and four-point self interaction terms,
:<math>\mathcal{L}_\text{H} = -\frac{gm_H^2}{4m_W}H^3-\frac{g^2m_H^2}{32m_W^2}H^4 ~.</math>

<math>\mathcal{L}_{\text{HV}}</math> contains the Higgs interactions with gauge vector bosons,
:<math>\mathcal{L}_{\text{HV}}=\left(gm_WH+\frac{g^2}4H^2\right)\left(W_\mu^+W^{-\mu}+\frac1{2\cos^2\theta_W}Z_\mu Z^\mu\right).</math>

<math>\mathcal{L}_{\text{WWV}}</math> contains the gauge three-point self interactions,
:<math>\mathcal{L}_{\text{WWV}} = -ig[(W_{\mu\nu}^+W^{-\mu}-W^{+\mu}W_{\mu\nu}^-)(A^\nu\sin\theta_W-Z^\nu\cos\theta_W)+W_\nu^-W_\mu^+(A^{\mu\nu}\sin\theta_W-Z^{\mu\nu}\cos\theta_W)] .</math>

<math>\mathcal{L}_{\text{WWVV}}</math> contains the gauge four-point self interactions,
:<math>
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{WWVV}} = -\frac{g^2}4 \Big\{&[2W_\mu^+W^{-\mu} + (A_\mu\sin\theta_W - Z_\mu\cos\theta_W)^2]^2
\\
&- [W_\mu^+W_\nu^- + W_\nu^+W_\mu^- + (A_\mu\sin\theta_W - Z_\mu\cos\theta_W) (A_\nu\sin\theta_W - Z_\nu\cos\theta_W)]^2\Big\}.
\end{align}
</math>

<math>\mathcal{L}_\text{Y}</math> contains the Yukawa interactions between the fermions and the Higgs field,
:<math>\mathcal{L}_\text{Y} = -\sum_f \frac{gm_f}{2m_W}\overline ffH.</math>

Note the <math>\tfrac{1}{2}(1-\gamma^5)</math> factors in the weak couplings: these factors project out the left handed components of the spinor fields. This is why electroweak theory  is  said to be a [[chiral theory]].
