'''Mercury 13''' refers to thirteen [[United States|American]] women who, as part of a privately funded program, underwent the same physiological screening tests as the [[astronaut]]s selected by [[NASA]] on April 9, 1959 for [[Project Mercury]].  The term was coined in 1959 by [[Hollywood]] producer James Cross as a comparison to the [[Mercury Seven]] name given to the selected male astronauts; however, the Mercury 13 were not part of [[NASA]]'s astronaut program, never flew in space and never met as a group.

In the 1960s some of the women lobbied the White House and Congress for inclusion of women in the astronaut program, even appearing before a congressional committee.  [[Clare Boothe Luce]] wrote an article for [[Life magazine|''LIFE'' magazine]] publicizing the women and criticizing NASA.

==History==
{{Listen|type=speech|pos=right|filename=The Mercury 13 (As Told By U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith).ogg |title=The Mercury 13 (As Told By U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith)|description= }}

[[William Randolph Lovelace II]], former Flight Surgeon and later, chairman of the NASA Special Advisory Committee on Life Science, helped develop the tests for NASA's male astronauts and became curious to know how women would do taking the same tests. In 1960, Lovelace and Brig. General Donald Flickinger invited [[Jerrie Cobb|Geraldyn "Jerrie" Cobb]] to undergo the same rigorous challenges as the men.<ref name=Weitekamp/>

Cobb, already an accomplished pilot, became the first American woman (and the only one of the Mercury 13) to undergo and pass all three phases of testing. Lovelace and Cobb recruited 19 more women to take the tests, financed by the husband of world-renowned aviator [[Jacqueline Cochran]]. Thirteen of the women passed the same tests as the Mercury 7.  Some were disqualified due to brain or heart anomalies. The results were announced at a conference in [[Stockholm, Sweden]]{{when|date=July 2016}}.

===Candidate background===
All of the candidates were accomplished pilots; Lovelace and Cobb reviewed the records of over 700 women pilots in order to select candidates, and did not invite anyone with less than 1,000 hours of flight experience.  Some of them may have been recruited through the [[Ninety-Nines]], a women pilot's organization of which Cobb was also a member. Some women responded after hearing about the opportunity through friends.

This group of women that Jerrie Cobb called the '''First Lady Astronaut Trainees''' (FLATs) accepted the challenge to be tested for a research program.<ref name=Weitekamp>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/flats.html |title=Lovelace's woman in space program |author= Weitekamp, Margaret A.| publisher=NASA History Program Office |date=January 28, 2010 |access-date=April 20, 2018}}</ref>

===Tests===
Since doctors didn't know what stresses astronauts would experience in space, tests ranged from the typical [[X-ray]] and general body physicals to the atypical, in which the women had to swallow a rubber tube so their [[stomach acid]]s could be tested. Doctors tested the reflexes in the [[ulnar nerve]] of the woman's forearms using electric shock. To induce [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], ice water was shot into their ears, freezing the inner ear so doctors could time how quickly they recovered. The women were pushed to exhaustion using specially weighted [[stationary bicycle]]s to test their respiration. They subjected themselves to many more invasive and uncomfortable tests.<ref>{{cite web | title=Hearings before the Special Subcommittee on the Selection of Astronauts | url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.a0000094904;view=1up;seq=85 | first=Victor L. | last=Anfuso | accessdate=Aug 22, 2017 | work=U.S. House of Representatives}}</ref>

===The 13===
In the end, thirteen women passed the same Phase I physical examinations that the Lovelace Foundation had developed as part of NASA's astronaut selection process. Those thirteen women were:
* [[Myrtle Cagle]]
* [[Jerrie Cobb]]
* [[Janet Dietrich]]<ref name=Lopez>{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/17/BA4211A0VO.DTL | title=Bay Area pilot Janet Christine Dietrich dies | date=2008-06-17 | access-date=April 20, 2018 | last=Lopez | first=Cory | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]}}</ref>
* [[Marion Dietrich]]<ref name=Lopez/>
* [[Wally Funk]]
* [[Sarah Gorelick]]
* [[Jane Briggs Hart|Jane "Janey" Briggs]]
* [[Jean Hixson]]
* [[Rhea Woltman]]
* Gene Nora Stumbough (later Jessen)
* [[Irene Leverton]]
* [[Jerri Sloan Truhill|Jerri Hamilton]]
* [[Bernice Steadman]]

Jane Hart was the oldest candidate, at 41, and mother of eight. Wally Funk, was  the youngest, at 23.<ref name=Weitekamp/> Marion and Janet Dietrich were twin sisters.<ref name=Lopez/>

===Additional tests===
A few women took additional tests. Jerrie Cobb, Rhea Hurrle, and Wally Funk went to [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] for Phase II testing, consisting of an isolation tank test and psychological evaluations. Because of other family and job commitments, not all of the women were able to take these tests, however. Instead, once Cobb had passed the Phase III tests (advanced aeromedical examinations using military equipment and jet aircraft), the group prepared to gather in [[Pensacola, Florida]] at the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|Naval School of Aviation Medicine]] to follow suit. Two of the women quit their jobs in order to be able to attend. A few days before they were to report, however, the women received [[telegram]]s abruptly canceling the Pensacola testing. Without an official NASA request to run the tests, the [[United States Navy]] would not allow the use of its facilities for an unofficial project.

It is sometimes claimed that Funk also completed the third phase of testing, but the claim is misleading.  Following cancellation of the tests, she found ways to continue being tested.  She did complete most of the Phase III tests, but only here and there as she was able, not as part of a specific program. Cobb passed all the training exercises, ranking in the top 2% of all astronaut candidates of both genders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2004-00026.html |title=Jerrie Cobb Poses beside Mercury Capsule |accessdate=August 15, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224200433/http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2004-00026.html |archivedate=December 24, 2011 |df= }}</ref>

==House Committee Hearing on Sex Discrimination==
Jerrie Cobb immediately flew to [[Washington, D.C.]] to try to have the testing program resumed. She and Janey Hart wrote to President [[John F. Kennedy]] and visited Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Finally, on 17 and 18 July 1962, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Victor Anfuso]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[New York (state)|NY]]) convened public hearings before a special Subcommittee of the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]].<ref>[http://nasa.lu/static/qualifications_for_astronauts_hearing_1962.pdf Qualifications for Astronauts: Hearings before the Special Subcommittee on the Selection of Astronauts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211072933/http://nasa.lu/static/qualifications_for_astronauts_hearing_1962.pdf |date=2015-12-11 }}, U.S. House of Representatives, 87th Cong. (1962)</ref> Significantly, the hearings investigated the possibility of [[gender discrimination]] two years before the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] made that illegal, making these hearings a marker of how ideas about women's rights permeated political discourse even before they were enshrined in law.

Cobb and Hart testified about the benefits of Lovelace's private project. [[Jacqueline Cochran]] largely undermined their testimony, talking about her concerns that setting up a special program to train a woman astronaut could hurt the space program. NASA representatives [[George Low]] and Astronauts [[John Glenn]] and [[Scott Carpenter]] testified that under NASA's selection criteria women could not qualify as astronaut candidates. Glenn also believed that "The fact that women are not in this field is a fact of our social order.".<ref name="One giant leap">{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/series/astronauts/astronauts02.html|title=One giant leap â€“ backward: Part 2|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=October 12, 2002|first=Stephanie|last=Nolan|access-date=December 8, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040913124515/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/series/astronauts/astronauts02.html|archivedate=September 13, 2004}}</ref> They correctly stated that NASA required all astronauts to be graduates of military jet test piloting programs and have engineering degrees, although John Glenn conceded that he had been assigned to NASA's Mercury Project without having earned the required college degree.<ref>Martha Ackman. The Mercury Thirteen: The true story of thirteen women and the dream of space flight. Random House, New York, 2003, p. 166.</ref>  In 1962, women were still barred from Air Force training schools, so no American women could become test pilots of military jets.  Despite the fact that several of the Mercury 13 had been employed as civilian test pilots, and many had considerably more propeller aircraft flying time than the male astronaut candidates (although not in high-performance jets, like the men), NASA refused to consider granting an equivalency for their hours in propeller airplanes.<ref>Stephanie Nolen.  Promised the Moon: The untold story of the first women in the space race.  Penguin Canada, Toronto, 2002, p. 240.</ref> Although some members of the Subcommittee were sympathetic to the women's arguments, because of this disparity in experience no action resulted.

Executive Assistant to Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]], Liz Carpenter, drafted a letter to NASA administrator [[James E. Webb]] questioning these requirements, but Johnson did not send the letter, instead writing across it, "Let's stop this now!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2331/1 |title=Youâ€™ve come a long way, baby! |publisher=The Space Review |author= Dwayne Day |date=July 15, 2013}}</ref>

== Media attention ==

Lovelace's privately funded women's testing project received renewed media attention when [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] cosmonaut [[Valentina Tereshkova]] became the first woman in space on June 16, 1963. In response, [[Clare Boothe Luce]] published an article<ref>{{cite web|author=Luce, Clare Boothe.|title=The U.S. Team Is Still Warming Up The Bench but some people simply never get the message. |publisher=Life Magazine, pages: 32-33|date=June 28, 1963|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00sEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA32}}</ref> in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' criticizing NASA and American decision makers. By including photographs of all thirteen Lovelace finalists, she made the names of all thirteen women public for the first time. (Significant media coverage had already spotlighted some of the participants, however.)

Although both Cobb and Cochran made separate appeals for years afterward to restart a women's astronaut testing project, the U.S. civil space agency did not select any female astronaut candidates until [[NASA Astronaut Group 8|Astronaut Group 8]] in 1978, which selected astronauts for the operational [[Space Shuttle]] program. Astronaut [[Sally Ride]] became the first American woman in space in 1983 on [[STS-7]], and [[Eileen Collins]] was the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle during [[STS-63]] in 1995. Collins also became the first woman to command a Space Shuttle mission during [[STS-93]] in 1999. In 2005, she commanded NASA's return to flight mission, [[STS-114]]. At Collins' invitation, seven of the surviving Lovelace finalists attended her first launch,<ref>{{cite web | title=The Mercury 13 Story | url=http://www.ninety-nines.org/mercury.html | first=Wally | last=Funk | accessdate=2009-06-12 | work=The Ninety-Nines | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507083703/http://www.ninety-nines.org/mercury.html | archivedate=2009-05-07 | df= }}</ref> ten of the FLATs attended her first command mission, and she has flown mementos for almost all of them.
