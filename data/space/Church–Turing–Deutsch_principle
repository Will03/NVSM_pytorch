In [[computer science]] and [[quantum physics]], the '''Church–Turing–Deutsch principle''' ('''CTD principle''')<ref>{{cite web|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|title=Interesting problems: The Church–Turing–Deutsch Principle|url=http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/interesting-problems-the-church-turing-deutsch-principle|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> is a stronger, physical form of the [[Church&ndash;Turing thesis]] formulated by [[David Deutsch]] in 1985.

==Statement==
The principle states that a [[Turing completeness|universal]] [[computer|computing device]] can [[simulation|simulate]] every [[physical process]].

==History==
The principle was stated by Deutsch in 1985 with respect to [[finitary]] machines and processes.<!-- so who (re)interpreted it in the form stated here? --> He observed that [[classical physics]], which makes use of the concept of [[real number]]s, cannot be simulated by a [[Turing machine]], which can only represent [[computable real]]s. Deutsch proposed that [[quantum computer]]s may actually obey the CTD principle, assuming that the laws of [[quantum physics]] can completely describe every physical process.

An earlier version of this thesis for classical computers was stated by Alan Turing's friend and student [[Robin Gandy]] in 1980.<ref>Gandy, R. (1980). Church’s thesis and principles for mechanisms.
