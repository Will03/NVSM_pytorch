'''Vacuum''' is [[space]] devoid of [[matter]]. The word stems from the Latin adjective ''vacuus'' for "vacant" or "void".  An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous [[pressure]] much less than [[atmospheric pressure]].<ref name="chambers">{{cite book |first=Austin |last=Chambers |date=2004 |title=Modern Vacuum Physics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |isbn=978-0-8493-2438-3 |oclc=55000526}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref>  Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a ''perfect'' vacuum, which they sometimes simply call "vacuum" or '''free space''', and use the term '''partial vacuum''' to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a [[laboratory]] or in [[outer space|space]].

In modern particle physics, the [[vacuum state]] is considered the [[ground state]] of a [[Field (physics)|field]].

Vacuum has been a frequent topic of [[philosophical]] debate since ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] times, but was not studied empirically until the 17th century. [[Evangelista Torricelli]] produced the first laboratory vacuum in 1643, and other experimental techniques were developed as a result of his theories of [[atmospheric pressure]]. A '''torricellian vacuum''' is created by filling a tall glass container closed at one end with mercury, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury (see below).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7igDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT3 ''How to Make an Experimental Geissler Tube''], [[Popular Science]] monthly, February 1919, Unnumbered page.

Vacuum became a valuable industrial tool in the 20th century with the introduction of [[incandescent light bulb]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s, and a wide array of vacuum technology has since become available. The recent development of [[human spaceflight]] has raised interest in the impact of vacuum on human health, and on life forms in general.

== Etymology ==
The word ''vacuum'' comes {{ety|la||an empty space, void}}, noun use of neuter of ''vacuus'', meaning "empty", related to ''vacare'', meaning "be empty".

''Vacuum'' is one of the few words in the [[English language]] that contains two consecutive letters '<nowiki/>''[[u]]'''.<ref name=double_u>{{cite web | title=What words in the English language contain two u's in a row? | website=Oxford Dictionaries Online | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/what-words-in-the-english-language-contain-two-u-s-in-a-row/ | accessdate=2011-10-23 | postscript={{inconsistent citations}} }}</ref>

== Historical interpretation ==
Historically, there has been much dispute over whether such a thing as a vacuum can exist. Ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] debated the existence of a vacuum, or void, in the context of [[atomism]], which posited void and atom as the fundamental explanatory elements of physics. Following [[Plato]], even the abstract concept of a featureless void faced considerable skepticism: it could not be apprehended by the senses, it could not, itself, provide additional explanatory power beyond the physical volume with which it was commensurate and, by definition, it was quite literally nothing at all, which cannot rightly be said to exist. [[Aristotle]] believed that no void could occur naturally, because the denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill any incipient rarity that might give rise to a void.

In his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', book IV, Aristotle offered numerous arguments against the void: for example, that motion through a medium which offered no impediment could continue ''ad infinitum'', there being no reason that something would come to rest anywhere in particular. Although [[Lucretius]] argued for the existence of vacuum in the first century BC and [[Hero of Alexandria]] tried unsuccessfully to create an artificial vacuum in the first century AD,<ref name="genz">{{cite book| last =Genz | first =Henning | publication-date =1999 | date =1994 | title =Nothingness, the Science of Empty Space | edition =translated from German by Karin Heusch | place =New York | publisher =Perseus Book Publishing | isbn =978-0-7382-0610-3 | oclc =48836264 }}</ref> it was European [[scholasticism|scholars]] such as [[Roger Bacon]], [[Blasius of Parma]] and [[Walter Burley]] in the 13th and 14th century who focused considerable attention on these issues. Eventually following [[Stoic physics]] in this instance, scholars from the 14th century onward increasingly departed from the Aristotelian perspective in favor of a [[supernatural]] void beyond the confines of the cosmos itself, a conclusion widely acknowledged by the 17th century, which helped to segregate natural and theological concerns.<ref name="Barrow2002">{{cite book |first=J.D. |last=Barrow |date=2002 |title=The Book of Nothing: Vacuums, Voids, and the Latest Ideas About the Origins of the Universe |series=Vintage Series |publisher=Vintage |isbn=978-0-375-72609-5 |lccn=00058894 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sU_K0wbBeugC&pg=PA77 |pages=71–72, 77}}</ref>

Almost two thousand years after Plato, [[René Descartes]] also proposed a geometrically based alternative theory of atomism, without the problematic nothing–everything [[dichotomy]] of void and atom. Although Descartes agreed with the contemporary position, that a vacuum does not occur in nature, the success of his [[Cartesian coordinate system|namesake coordinate system]] and more implicitly, the spatial–corporeal component of his metaphysics would come to define the philosophically modern notion of empty space as a quantified extension of volume. By the ancient definition however, directional information and magnitude were conceptually distinct.

In 1654, [[Otto von Guericke]] invented the first [[vacuum pump]]<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica:Otto von Guericke</ref> and conducted his famous [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] experiment, showing that teams of horses could not separate two hemispheres from which the air had been partially evacuated. [[Robert Boyle]] improved Guericke's design and with the help of [[Robert Hooke]] further developed vacuum pump technology. Thereafter, research into the partial vacuum lapsed until 1850 when [[August Toepler]] invented the [[Toepler Pump]] and [[Heinrich Geissler]] invented the mercury displacement pump in 1855, achieving a partial vacuum of about 10&nbsp;Pa (0.1&nbsp;[[Torr]]). A number of electrical properties become observable at this vacuum level, which renewed interest in further research.

While outer space provides the most rarefied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum, the heavens were originally thought to be seamlessly filled by a rigid indestructible material called [[aether (classical element)|aether]]. Borrowing somewhat from the [[pneuma]] of [[Stoic physics]], aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see [[Aether (mythology)]]). Early theories of [[light]] posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed [[Isaac Newton]]'s explanations of both [[refraction]] and of radiant heat.<ref>[[Robert Hogarth Patterson]], ''Essays in History and Art 10'', 1862</ref>  19th century experiments into this [[luminiferous aether]] attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected. In 1912, [[astronomer]] [[William Henry Pickering|Henry Pickering]] commented: "While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, [it] is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are certainly there".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pickering | first1 = W.H. | date =1912 | title = Solar system, the motion of the, relatively to the interstellar absorbing medium | journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume = 72 | issue = 9 |bibcode=1912MNRAS..72..740P | page = 740 | doi=10.1093/mnras/72.9.740}}</ref>

Later, in 1930, [[Paul Dirac]] proposed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles possessing negative energy, called the [[Dirac sea]]. This theory helped refine the predictions of his earlier formulated [[Dirac equation]], and successfully predicted the existence of the [[positron]], confirmed two years later. [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[uncertainty principle]] formulated in 1927, predict a fundamental limit within which instantaneous position and [[momentum]], or energy and time can be measured. This has far reaching consequences on the "emptiness" of space between particles. In the late 20th century, so-called [[virtual particle]]s that arise spontaneously from empty space were confirmed.

{{refimprove|subsection|date=April 2014}}
The strictest criterion to define a vacuum is a region of space and time where all the components of the [[stress–energy tensor]] are zero. This means that this region is devoid of energy and momentum, and by consequence, it must be empty of particles and other physical fields (such as electromagnetism) that contain energy and momentum.

=== Gravity ===
{{refimprove|subsection|date=April 2014}}
In [[general relativity]], a vanishing stress-energy tensor implies, through [[Einstein field equations]], the vanishing of all the components of the [[Ricci tensor]]. Vacuum does not mean that the curvature of [[space-time]] is necessarily flat: the gravitational field can still produce curvature in a vacuum in the form of tidal forces and [[gravitational wave]]s (technically, these phenomena are the components of the [[Weyl tensor]]). The [[black hole]] (with zero electric charge) is an elegant example of a region completely "filled" with vacuum, but still showing a strong curvature.

[[File:Vacuum fluctuations revealed through spontaneous parametric down-conversion.ogv|thumb|350px|A video of an experiment showing [[vacuum fluctuations]] (in the red ring) amplified by [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]].]]

In [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]], the vacuum is defined as the state (that is, the solution to the equations of the theory) with the lowest possible energy (the [[ground state]] of the [[Hilbert space]]). In [[quantum electrodynamics]] this vacuum is referred to as '[[QED vacuum]]' to distinguish it from the vacuum of [[quantum chromodynamics]], denoted as [[QCD vacuum]]. QED vacuum is a state with no matter particles (hence the name), and also no [[photon]]s. As described above, this state is impossible to achieve experimentally. (Even if every matter particle could somehow be removed from a volume, it would be impossible to eliminate all the [[black body radiation|blackbody photons]].) Nonetheless, it provides a good model for realizable vacuum, and agrees with a number of experimental observations as described next.

QED vacuum has interesting and complex properties. In QED vacuum, the electric and magnetic fields have zero average values, but their variances are not zero.<ref name=Craig>For example, see {{cite book |title=Molecular Quantum Electrodynamics |author=Craig, D.P. |author2= Thirunamachandran, T. |last-author-amp=yes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpbdozIZt3sC&pg=PA40 |page=40 |isbn=978-0-486-40214-7 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |date=1998 |edition=Reprint of Academic Press 1984}}</ref> As a result, QED vacuum contains [[vacuum fluctuations]] ([[virtual particles]] that hop into and out of existence), and a finite energy called [[vacuum energy]]. Vacuum fluctuations are an essential and ubiquitous part of quantum field theory. Some experimentally verified effects of vacuum fluctuations include [[spontaneous emission]] and the [[Lamb shift]].<ref name=Barrow />  [[Coulomb's law]] and the [[electric potential]] in vacuum near an electric charge are modified.<ref name=Zeidler>In effect, the dielectric permittivity of the vacuum of classical electromagnetism is changed. For example, see {{cite book |chapter=§&nbsp;19.1.9 Vacuum polarization in quantum electrodynamics |author=Zeidler, Eberhard |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miwuxaEXvOsC&pg=PA952 |page=952 |isbn=978-3-642-22420-1 |publisher=Springer |date=2011 |title=Quantum Field Theory III: Gauge Theory: A Bridge Between Mathematicians and Physicists}}</ref>

Stars, planets, and moons keep their [[atmosphere]]s by gravitational attraction, and as such, atmospheres have no clearly delineated boundary: the density of atmospheric gas simply decreases with distance from the object.

The [[thermosphere]] in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to [[space weather]]. Astrophysicists prefer to use [[number density]] to describe these environments, in units of particles per cubic centimetre.

But although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on [[satellite]]s.

All of the [[observable universe]] is filled with large numbers of [[photon]]s, the so-called [[cosmic background radiation]], and quite likely a correspondingly large number of [[neutrino]]s. The current [[temperature]] of this radiation is about 3 [[Kelvin|K]], or −270 degrees Celsius or −454 degrees Fahrenheit.

== Measurement ==
{{Main|Pressure measurement}}

The quality of a vacuum is indicated by the amount of matter remaining in the system, so that a high quality vacuum is one with very little matter left in it. Vacuum is primarily measured by its [[absolute pressure]], but a complete characterization requires further parameters, such as [[temperature]] and chemical composition. One of the most important parameters is the [[mean free path]] (MFP) of residual gases, which indicates the average distance that molecules will travel between collisions with each other. As the gas density decreases, the MFP increases, and when the MFP is longer than the chamber, pump, spacecraft, or other objects present, the continuum assumptions of [[fluid mechanics]] do not apply. This vacuum state is called ''high vacuum'', and the study of fluid flows in this regime is called particle gas dynamics. The MFP of air at atmospheric pressure is very short, 70&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]], but at 100&nbsp;[[millipascal|mPa]] (~{{val|1|e=-3|u=[[Torr]]}}) the MFP of room temperature air is roughly 100&nbsp;mm, which is on the order of everyday objects such as [[vacuum tube]]s. The [[Crookes radiometer]] turns when the MFP is larger than the size of the vanes.

Vacuum quality is subdivided into ranges according to the technology required to achieve it or measure it. These ranges do not have universally agreed definitions, but a typical distribution is shown in the following table.<ref>{{cite web|author=American Vacuum Society |title=Glossary |website=AVS Reference Guide |url=http://www.aip.org/avsguide/refguide/glossary.html#v |accessdate=2006-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304160701/http://www.aip.org/avsguide/refguide/glossary.html |archivedate=2006-03-04 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author=National Physical Laboratory, UK| title=What do 'high vacuum' and 'low vacuum' mean?

* '''Atmospheric pressure''' is variable but standardized at 101.325&nbsp;kPa (760&nbsp;Torr).
* '''Low vacuum''', also called ''rough vacuum'' or ''coarse vacuum'', is vacuum that can be achieved or measured with rudimentary equipment such as a [[vacuum cleaner]] and a liquid column [[Pressure measurement|manometer]].
* '''Medium vacuum''' is vacuum that can be achieved with a single pump, but the pressure is too low to measure with a liquid or mechanical manometer. It can be measured with a [[McLeod gauge]], thermal gauge or a capacitive gauge.
* '''High vacuum''' is vacuum where the [[mean free path|MFP]] of residual gases is longer than the size of the chamber or of the object under test. High vacuum usually requires multi-stage pumping and ion gauge measurement. Some texts differentiate between high vacuum and ''very high vacuum.''
* '''Ultra high vacuum''' requires baking the chamber to remove trace gases, and other special procedures. British and German standards define ultra high vacuum as pressures below 10<sup>−6</sup>&nbsp;Pa (10<sup>−8</sup>&nbsp;Torr).<ref>BS 2951: Glossary of Terms Used in Vacuum Technology. Part I. Terms of General Application. British Standards Institution, London, 1969.</ref><ref>DIN 28400: Vakuumtechnik Bennenungen und Definitionen, 1972.</ref>
* '''Deep space''' is generally much more empty than any artificial vacuum. It may or may not meet the definition of high vacuum above, depending on what region of space and astronomical bodies are being considered. For example, the MFP of interplanetary space is smaller than the size of the Solar System, but larger than small planets and moons. As a result, solar winds exhibit continuum flow on the scale of the Solar System, but must be considered a bombardment of particles with respect to the Earth and Moon.
* '''Perfect vacuum''' is an ideal state of no particles at all. It cannot be achieved in a [[laboratory]], although there may be small volumes which, for a brief moment, happen to have no particles of matter in them. Even if all particles of matter were removed, there would still be [[photon]]s and [[graviton]]s, as well as [[dark energy]], [[virtual particle]]s, and other aspects of the [[quantum vacuum]].
* '''Hard vacuum''' and '''soft vacuum''' are terms that are defined with a dividing line defined differently by different sources, such as 1 [[Torr]],<ref>{{cite web

=== Relative versus absolute measurement ===
Vacuum is measured in units of [[pressure]], typically as a subtraction relative to ambient atmospheric pressure on Earth. But the amount of relative measurable vacuum varies with local conditions. On the surface of [[Jupiter]], where ground level atmospheric pressure is much higher than on Earth, much higher relative vacuum readings would be possible. On the surface of the moon with almost no atmosphere, it would be extremely difficult to create a measurable vacuum relative to the local environment.

Similarly, much higher than normal relative vacuum readings are possible deep in the Earth's ocean. A [[submarine]] maintaining an internal pressure of 1 atmosphere submerged to a depth of 10 atmospheres (98 metres; a 9.8 metre column of seawater has the equivalent weight of 1 atm) is effectively a vacuum chamber keeping out the crushing exterior water pressures, though the 1 atm inside the submarine would not normally be considered a vacuum.

Therefore, to properly understand the following discussions of vacuum measurement, it is important that the reader assumes the relative measurements are being done on Earth at sea level, at exactly 1 atmosphere of ambient atmospheric pressure.

=== Measurements relative to 1 atm ===
[[File:McLeod gauge 01.jpg|right|thumb|A glass McLeod gauge, drained of mercury]]
The [[SI]] unit of pressure is the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (symbol Pa), but vacuum is often measured in [[torr]]s, named for Torricelli, an early Italian physicist (1608–1647). A torr is equal to the displacement of a millimeter of mercury ([[mmHg]]) in a [[manometer]] with 1&nbsp;torr equaling 133.3223684 pascals above absolute zero pressure. Vacuum is often also measured on the [[barometer|barometric]] scale or as a percentage of [[atmospheric pressure]] in [[bar (unit)|bars]] or [[atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]].  Low vacuum is often measured in [[millimeters of mercury]] (mmHg) or pascals (Pa) below standard atmospheric pressure. "Below atmospheric" means that the absolute pressure is equal to the current atmospheric pressure.

In other words, most low vacuum gauges that read, for example 50.79&nbsp;Torr. Many inexpensive low vacuum gauges have a margin of error and may report a vacuum of 0&nbsp;Torr but in practice this generally requires a two-stage rotary vane or other medium type of vacuum pump to go much beyond (lower than) 1&nbsp;torr.

=== Measuring instruments ===
Many devices are used to measure the pressure in a vacuum, depending on what range of vacuum is needed.<ref>{{cite book| first=Moore | last=John H. | author2=Christopher Davis | author3=Michael A. Coplan | author4=Sandra Greer | last-author-amp=yes | title=Building Scientific Apparatus | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO | date=2002 | isbn=978-0-8133-4007-4 | oclc=50287675 }}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref>

'''Hydrostatic''' gauges (such as the mercury column [[manometer]]) consist of a vertical column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube. The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube, one side of which is connected to the region of interest. Any fluid can be used, but [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1&nbsp;torr (100&nbsp;Pa) to above atmospheric. An important variation is the [[McLeod gauge]] which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column. The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10<sup>−6</sup>&nbsp;torr (0.1&nbsp;mPa), which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-controlled properties. These indirect measurements must be calibrated via a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.<ref name=measure>{{cite book| first=Thomas G. | last=Beckwith | author2=Roy D. Marangoni | author3=John H. Lienhard V | last-author-amp=yes | date=1993 | title=Mechanical Measurements | edition=Fifth | publisher=Addison-Wesley | location=Reading, MA | isbn=978-0-201-56947-6 | pages=591–595 | chapter=Measurement of Low Pressures }}</ref>

The kenotometer is a particular type of hydrostatic gauge, typically used in power plants using steam turbines. The kenotometer measures the vacuum in the steam space of the condenser, that is, the exhaust of the last stage of the turbine.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ephf.ca/blog.asp?id=74 | title=Kenotometer Vacuum Gauge | publisher=Edmonton Power Historical Foundation | date=22 November 2013 | accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref>

'''Mechanical''' or '''elastic''' gauges depend on a Bourdon tube, diaphragm, or capsule, usually made of metal, which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question. A variation on this idea is the '''capacitance manometer''', in which the diaphragm makes up a part of a capacitor. A change in pressure leads to the flexure of the diaphragm, which results in a change in capacitance. These gauges are effective from 10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;torr to 10<sup>−4</sup>&nbsp;torr, and beyond.

'''Thermal conductivity''' gauges rely on the fact that the ability of a gas to conduct heat decreases with pressure. In this type of gauge, a wire filament is heated by running current through it. A  [[Thermocouple#Thermocouple as vacuum gauge|thermocouple]] or [[Resistance Temperature Detector]] (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the [[Pirani gauge]] which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10&nbsp;torr to 10<sup>−3</sup>&nbsp;torr, but they are sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.

'''[[Ionization gauge]]s''' are used in ultrahigh vacuum. They come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the [[Hot filament ionization gauge|hot cathode]] version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10<sup>−3</sup>&nbsp;torr to 10<sup>−10</sup> torr. The principle behind [[cold cathode]] version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10<sup>−2</sup>&nbsp;torr to 10<sup>−9</sup>&nbsp;torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Robert M.

== Uses ==
[[File:Gluehlampe 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|right|[[incandescent light bulb|Light bulbs]] contain a partial vacuum, usually backfilled with [[argon]], which protects the [[tungsten]] filament]]

Vacuum is useful in a variety of processes and devices. Its first widespread use was in the [[incandescent light bulb]] to protect the filament from chemical degradation. The chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for [[electron beam welding]], [[cold welding]], [[vacuum packing]] and [[Vacuum fryer|vacuum frying]]. [[Ultra-high vacuum]] is used in the study of atomically clean substrates, as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time (on the order of minutes to days). High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind [[chemical vapor deposition]], [[physical vapor deposition]], and [[dry etching]] which are essential to the fabrication of [[semiconductor fabrication|semiconductors]] and [[optical coating]]s, and to [[surface science]]. The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of [[thermos bottle]]s. Deep vacuum lowers the [[boiling point]] of liquids and promotes low temperature [[outgassing]] which is used in [[freeze drying]], [[adhesive]] preparation, [[vacuum distillation|distillation]], [[metallurgy]], and process purging. The electrical properties of vacuum make [[electron microscope]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s possible, including [[cathode ray tube]]s. [[Vacuum interrupter]]s are used in electrical switchgear.  [[Vacuum arc]] processes are industrially important for production of certain grades of steel or high purity materials. The elimination of air [[friction]] is useful for [[flywheel energy storage]] and [[ultracentrifuge]]s.

[[File:L-Pumpe2.png|thumb|left|This shallow water well pump reduces atmospheric air pressure inside the pump chamber. Atmospheric pressure extends down into the well, and forces water up the pipe into the pump to balance the reduced pressure. Above-ground pump chambers are only effective to a depth of approximately 9 meters due to the water column weight balancing the atmospheric pressure.]]

=== Vacuum-driven machines ===
Vacuums are commonly used to produce [[suction]], which has an even wider variety of applications. The [[Newcomen steam engine]] used vacuum instead of pressure to drive a piston. In the 19th century, vacuum was used for traction on [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s experimental [[atmospheric railway]].  [[Vacuum brake]]s were once widely used on [[train]]s in the UK but, except on [[heritage railway]]s, they have been replaced by [[Railway air brake|air brakes]].

[[Manifold vacuum]] can be used to drive [[Automobile ancillary power#Vacuum|accessories]] on [[automobile]]s.  The best-known application is the [[vacuum servo]], used to provide power assistance for the [[brake]]s.  Obsolete applications include vacuum-driven [[windscreen wipers]] and [[Autovac]] fuel pumps.  Some aircraft instruments (Attitude Indicator (AI) and the Heading Indicator (HI)) are typically vacuum-powered, as protection against loss of all (electrically powered) instruments, since early aircraft often did not have electrical systems, and since there are two readily available sources of vacuum on a moving aircraft, the engine and an external venturi.
[[Vacuum induction melting]] uses electromagnetic induction within a vacuum.

Maintaining a vacuum in the [[Condenser (steam turbine)|Condenser]] is an important aspect of the efficient operation of [[steam turbine]]s. A steam jet [[Steam ejector|ejector]] or [[Liquid ring pump|liquid ring vacuum pump]] is used for this purpose.  The typical vacuum maintained in the Condenser steam space at the exhaust of the turbine (also called Condenser Backpressure) is in the range 5 to 15 kPa (absolute), depending on the type of condenser and the ambient conditions.

=== Outgassing ===
{{Main|Outgassing}}

[[Evaporation]] and [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] into a vacuum is called [[outgassing]]. All materials, solid or liquid, have a small [[vapour pressure]], and their outgassing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure.  Outgassing has the same effect as a leak and can limit the achievable vacuum. Outgassing products may condense on nearby colder surfaces, which can be troublesome if they obscure optical instruments or react with other materials. This is of great concern to space missions, where an obscured telescope or solar cell can ruin an expensive mission.

The most prevalent outgassing product in vacuum systems is water absorbed by chamber materials. It can be reduced by desiccating or baking the chamber, and removing absorbent materials. Outgassed water can condense in the oil of [[rotary vane pump]]s and reduce their net speed drastically if gas ballasting is not used. High vacuum systems must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing.

Ultra-high vacuum systems are usually baked, preferably under vacuum, to temporarily raise the vapour pressure of all outgassing materials and boil them off. Once the bulk of the outgassing materials are boiled off and evacuated, the system may be cooled to lower vapour pressures and minimize residual outgassing during actual operation. Some systems are cooled well below room temperature by [[liquid nitrogen]] to shut down residual outgassing and simultaneously [[cryopump]] the system.

=== Pumping and ambient air pressure ===
[[File:Hand pump.png|thumb|left|Deep wells have the pump chamber down in the well close to the water surface, or in the water. A "sucker rod" extends from the handle down the center of the pipe deep into the well to operate the plunger. The pump handle acts as a heavy counterweight against both the sucker rod weight and the weight of the water column standing on the upper plunger up to ground level.]]

{{Main|Vacuum pump}}

Fluids cannot generally be pulled, so a vacuum cannot be created by [[suction]]. Suction can spread and dilute a vacuum by letting a higher pressure push fluids into it, but the vacuum has to be created first before suction can occur. The easiest way to create an artificial vacuum is to expand the volume of a container. For example, the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm muscle]] expands the chest cavity, which causes the volume of the lungs to increase. This expansion reduces the pressure and creates a partial vacuum, which is soon filled by air pushed in by atmospheric pressure.

To continue evacuating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth, a compartment of the vacuum can be repeatedly closed off, exhausted, and expanded again. This is the principle behind [[vacuum pump#Positive displacement pump|positive displacement pumps]], like the manual water pump for example. Inside the pump, a mechanism expands a small sealed cavity to create a vacuum. Because of the pressure differential, some fluid from the chamber (or the well, in our example) is pushed into the pump's small cavity. The pump's cavity is then sealed from the chamber, opened to the atmosphere, and squeezed back to a minute size.

[[File:Cut through turbomolecular pump.jpg|thumb|A cutaway view of a [[turbomolecular pump]], a momentum transfer pump used to achieve high vacuum]]

The above explanation is merely a simple introduction to vacuum pumping, and is not representative of the entire range of pumps in use. Many variations of the positive displacement pump have been developed, and many other pump designs rely on fundamentally different principles. [[vacuum pump#Momentum transfer pump|Momentum transfer pumps]], which bear some similarities to dynamic pumps used at higher pressures, can achieve much higher quality vacuums than positive displacement pumps. [[vacuum pump#Entrapment pump|Entrapment pumps]] can capture gases in a solid or absorbed state, often with no moving parts, no seals and no vibration. None of these pumps are universal; each type has important performance limitations. They all share a difficulty in pumping low molecular weight gases, especially [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[neon]].

The lowest pressure that can be attained in a system is also dependent on many things other than the nature of the pumps. Multiple pumps may be connected in series, called stages, to achieve higher vacuums. The choice of seals, chamber geometry, materials, and pump-down procedures will all have an impact. Collectively, these are called ''vacuum technique''. And sometimes, the final pressure is not the only relevant characteristic. Pumping systems differ in oil contamination, vibration, preferential pumping of certain gases, pump-down speeds, intermittent duty cycle, reliability, or tolerance to high leakage rates.

In [[ultra high vacuum]] systems, some very "odd" leakage paths and outgassing sources must be considered. The water absorption of [[aluminium]] and [[palladium]] becomes an unacceptable source of outgassing, and even the adsorptivity of hard metals such as stainless steel or [[titanium]] must be considered. Some oils and greases will boil off in extreme vacuums. The permeability of the metallic chamber walls may have to be considered, and the grain direction of the metallic flanges should be parallel to the flange face.

The lowest pressures currently achievable in laboratory are about 10<sup>−13</sup> torr (13&nbsp;pPa).<ref>{{cite journal| author=Ishimaru, H | title= Ultimate Pressure of the Order of 10<sup>−13</sup> torr in an Aluminum Alloy Vacuum Chamber | journal= Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology | date=1989 | volume=7 | issue=3–II | pages= 2439–2442 | doi= 10.1116/1.575916 }}</ref>  However, pressures as low as {{val|5|e=-17|u=torr}} (6.7&nbsp;fPa) have been indirectly measured in a 4&nbsp;K cryogenic vacuum system.<ref name=Gabrielse>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.65.1317| pmid = 10042233| title = Thousandfold improvement in the measured antiproton mass| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 65| issue = 11| pages = 1317–1320| year = 1990| last1 = Gabrielse | first1 = G.| last2 = Fei | first2 = X.| last3 = Orozco | first3 = L.| last4 = Tjoelker | first4 = R.| last5 = Haas | first5 = J.| last6 = Kalinowsky | first6 = H.| last7 = Trainor | first7 = T.| last8 = Kells | first8 = W.|bibcode = 1990PhRvL..65.1317G | url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/493773/files/cm-p00043126.pdf}}</ref> This corresponds to ≈100 particles/cm<sup>3</sup>.

An experiment indicates that plants are able to survive in a low pressure environment (1.5&nbsp;kPa) for about 30 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.asr.2010.12.017 |title=Plants survive rapid decompression: Implications for bioregenerative life support |date=2011 |last1=Wheeler |first1=R.M. |last2=Wehkamp |first2=C.A. |last3=Stasiak |first3=M.A. |last4=Dixon |first4=M.A. |last5=Rygalov |first5=V.Y. |journal=Advances in Space Research |volume=47 |issue=9 |pages=1600–1607 |bibcode=2011AdSpR..47.1600W|hdl=2060/20130009997 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11987308 |date=2002 |last1=Ferl |first1=RJ |last2=Schuerger |first2=AC |last3=Paul |first3=AL |last4=Gurley |first4=WB |last5=Corey |first5=K |last6=Bucklin |first6=R |title=Plant adaptation to low atmospheric pressures: Potential molecular responses |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=93–101 |journal=Life Support & Biosphere Science}}</ref>

Cold or oxygen-rich atmospheres can sustain life at pressures much lower than atmospheric, as long as the density of oxygen is similar to that of standard sea-level atmosphere. The colder air temperatures found at altitudes of up to 3&nbsp;km generally compensate for the lower pressures there.<ref name="harding" /> Above this altitude, oxygen enrichment is necessary to prevent [[altitude sickness]] in humans that did not undergo prior [[acclimatization]], and [[spacesuit]]s are necessary to prevent ebullism above 19&nbsp;km.<ref name="harding" />  Most spacesuits use only 20&nbsp;kPa (150&nbsp;Torr) of pure oxygen. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but [[decompression sickness]] and [[air embolism|gas embolisms]] can still occur if decompression rates are not managed.

Rapid decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself. Even if the victim does not hold his or her breath, venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate [[alveoli]] of the [[lung]]s.<ref name="harding" /> [[Eardrum]]s and sinuses may be ruptured by rapid decompression, soft tissues may bruise and seep blood, and the stress of shock will accelerate oxygen consumption leading to hypoxia.<ref name="Landis Ebullism">{{cite web| author=Czarnik, Tamarack R.| date=1999|website=unpublished review by Landis, Geoffrey A. | title=EBULLISM AT 1 MILLION FEET: Surviving Rapid/Explosive Decompression | url=http://www.geoffreylandis.com/ebullism.html | publisher= geoffreylandis}}</ref> Injuries caused by rapid decompression are called [[barotrauma]]. A pressure drop of 13&nbsp;kPa (100&nbsp;Torr), which produces no symptoms if it is gradual, may be fatal if it occurs suddenly.<ref name="harding" />

Some [[extremophile]] [[microorganisms]], such as [[tardigrade]]s, can survive vacuum conditions for periods of days or weeks.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Tardigrades survive exposure to space in low Earth orbit | journal = Current Biology | date = 9 September 2008 |author = Jönsson, K.
