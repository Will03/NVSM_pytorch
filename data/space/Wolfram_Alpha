'''Wolfram Alpha''' (also styled '''WolframAlpha''', and '''Wolfram|Alpha''') is a computational knowledge engine<ref name=Guardiandatasource>{{cite news |title=Where does Wolfram Alpha get its information? |author=Bobbie Johnson |publisher=The Guardian |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=2013-03-08 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/21/1 }}</ref> or [[answer engine]] developed by Wolfram Alpha LLC, a subsidiary of [[Wolfram Research]]. It is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from externally sourced "curated data",<ref>{{Cite web|title = About Wolfram{{!}}Alpha: Making the World's Knowledge Computable|url = http://www.wolframalpha.com/about.html|website=wolframalpha.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}</ref> rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a [[search engine]] might.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/09/search-engine-google |title=British search engine 'could rival Google' |last=Johnson |first=Bobbie |date=March 9, 2009 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=UK |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref>

Wolfram Alpha, which was released on May 18, 2009, is based on Wolfram's earlier flagship product [[Wolfram Mathematica]], a computational platform or toolkit that encompasses computer algebra, symbolic and numerical computation, visualization, and statistics capabilities.<ref name="launch date" /> Additional data is gathered from both academic and commercial websites such as the CIA's ''[[The World Factbook]]'', the [[United States Geological Survey]], a Cornell University Library publication called ''All About Birds'', ''[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]]'', [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]], the ''[[Catalogue of Life]]'',<ref name=Guardiandatasource /> [[CrunchBase]],<ref name=techcrunch>{{cite news |last=Dillet |first=Romain |title=Wolfram Alpha Makes CrunchBase Data Computable Just In Time For Disrupt SF |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/wolfram-alpha-makes-crunchbase-data-computable-just-in-time-for-disrupt/ |publisher=TechCrunch |date=September 7, 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> [[Best Buy]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Golson |first=Jordan |title=Wolfram Delivers Siri-Enabled Shopping Results From Best Buy |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2011/12/16/wolfram-delivers-siri-enabled-shopping-results-from-best-buy/ |publisher=MacRumors |date=December 16, 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Barylick |first=Chris |title=Wolfram Alpha search engine now tracks flight paths, trajectory information |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/11/19/wolfram-alpha-search-engine-now-tracks-flight-paths-trajectory/ |publisher=Engadget |date=November 19, 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> and optionally a user's Facebook account.

== Overview ==
Users submit queries and computation requests via a text field.  Wolfram Alpha then computes answers and relevant visualizations from a [[knowledge base]] of [[Data curation|curated]], [[structured data]] that come from other sites and books. The site "use[s] a portfolio of automated and manual methods, including statistics, visualization, source cross-checking, and expert review."<ref>{{cite web |title=Data in Wolfram&#124;Alpha |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/faqs5.html |website=Wolfram Alpha |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref> The curated data makes Alpha different from [[semantic search]] engines, which index a large number of answers and then try to match the question to one.

Wolfram Alpha can only provide robust query results based on computational facts, not queries on the social sciences, cultural studies or even many questions about history where responses require more subtlety and complexity. It is able to respond to particularly-phrased [[natural language understanding|natural language]] fact-based questions such as "Where was [[Mary Robinson]] born?" or more complex questions such as "How old was [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1974?" It displays its "Input interpretation" of such a question, using standardized phrases such as "age | of Queen Elizabeth II (royalty) | in 1974", the answer of which is "Age at start of 1974: 47 years", and a biography link. Wolfram Alpha does not answer queries which require a narrative response such as "What is the difference between the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars?" but will answer factual or computational questions such as "June 1 in Julian calendar".

Mathematical symbolism can be parsed by the engine, which typically responds with more than the numerical results. For example, "lim(x->0) (sin x)/x" yields the correct [[limit (functions)|limit]]ing value of 1, as well as a plot, up to 235 terms ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}) of the [[Taylor series]], and (for registered users) a possible derivation using [[L'Hôpital's rule]]. It is also able to perform calculations on data using more than one source. For example, "What is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|fifty-second smallest]] country by [[GDP per capita]]?" yields [[Nicaragua]], $1160 per year.

== Technology ==
Wolfram Alpha is written in 15 million lines of [[Wolfram Language]] code<ref>{{cite web |author=WolframResearch |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56ISaies6Ws#t=927s |title=Stephen Wolfram: The Background and Vision of Mathematica |publisher=Youtube.com |date=October 10, 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> and runs on more than 10,000 CPUs.<ref>{{cite news |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |url=http://readwrite.com/2009/04/25/wolframalpha_our_first_impressions |title=Wolfram&#124;Alpha: Our First Impressions |date=April 25, 2009 |publisher=ReadWriteWeb |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Wolfram |url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2009/05/15/wolframalpha-is-launching-made-possible-by-mathematica/ |title=Wolfram&#124;Alpha Is Launching: Made Possible by ''Mathematica'' |work=WolframAlpha Blog |publisher=Wolfram Alpha |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> The database currently includes hundreds of datasets, such as "All Current and Historical Weather." The datasets have been accumulated over several years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Taking a first bite out of Wolfram Alpha | first=Jane Fae | last=Ozimek |work=The Register |date=May 18, 2009 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/18/wolfram_alpha/ |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> The curated (as distinct from auto-generated) datasets are checked for quality either by a scientist or other expert in a relevant field, or someone acting in a clerical capacity who simply verifies that the datasets are "acceptable".

One example of a live dataset that Wolfram Alpha can use is the profile of a [[Facebook]] user, through inputting the "facebook report" query. If the user authorizes Facebook to share his or her account details with the Wolfram site, Alpha can generate a "personal analytics" report containing the age distribution of friends, the frequency of words used in status updates and other detailed information.<ref name=techland>{{cite news |first=Thomas E. |last=Weber |url=http://techland.time.com/2012/09/05/wolfram-alphas-facebook-analytics-tool-digs-deep-into-your-social-life/ |title=Wolfram Alpha's Facebook Analytics Tool Digs Deep into Your Social Life |work=Tech |publisher=Time Magazine |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> Within two weeks of launching the Facebook analytics service, 400,000 users had used it.<ref>{{cite news |last=R. |first=A. |title=Visualising Facebook Who am I? |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/09/visualising-facebook |publisher=The Economist |work=Graphic detail |date=September 21, 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> Downloadable query results are behind a pay wall but summaries are accessible to free accounts.<ref name=publiclibraries>{{cite web |url=http://publiclibrariesonline.org/2013/03/a-wolf-or-a-ram-what-is-wolfram-alpha/ |title=A Wolf or a Ram?

== History ==
Launch preparations began on May 15, 2009 at 7&nbsp;pm [[Central Daylight Time (North America)#Central Daylight Time|CDT]] and were broadcast live on [[Justin.tv]]. The plan was to publicly launch the service a few hours later, with expected issues due to extreme load. The service was officially launched on May 18, 2009.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8052798.stm |title=Wolfram 'search engine' goes live |publisher=BBC News |date=May 18, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref>

Wolfram Alpha has received mixed reviews.<ref name="spivack">{{cite web |first=Nova |last=Spivack |title=Wolfram Alpha is Coming – and It Could be as Important as Google |date=March 7, 2009 |url=http://www.novaspivack.com/uncategorized/wolfram-alpha-is-coming-and-it-could-be-as-important-as-google |accessdate=2013-02-09 |publisher=Nova Spivack – Minding the Planet}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Ryan |last=Singel |title=Wolfram&#124;Alpha Fails the Cool Test |date=May 18, 2009 |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/05/wolframalpha-fails-the-cool-test/ |publisher=Wired |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> Wolfram Alpha advocates point to its potential, some even stating that how it determines results is more important than current usefulness.<ref name="spivack"/>

On December 3, 2009, an [[iPhone]] app was introduced. Some users<ref name="ios-price">{{cite web |first=MG |last=Siegler |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/03/wolfram-alpha-iphone-app/ |title=Nice Try, Wolfram Alpha.

They also complained about the simultaneous removal of the mobile formatting option for the site.<ref name="mobile-format">{{cite news |url=http://www.tuaw.com/2009/12/03/wolframalpha-iphone-formatted-web-page-no-longer-available/ |first=TJ |last=Luoma |title=WolframAlpha iPhone-formatted web page no longer available |publisher=TUAW |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> Wolfram responded by lowering the price to $2, offering a refund to existing customers<ref name="refund">{{cite web|last=Broida |first=Rick |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10471978-233.html |title=Get Wolfram Alpha app for $1.99-and a refund if you paid more |publisher=CNET |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}</ref> and re-instating the mobile site.

On October 6, 2010, an Android version of the app was released<ref>{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/wolframalphas-android-app-now-available/ |title=Wolfram Alpha's Android app now available |first=Leena |last=Rao |publisher=TechCrunch |date=October 6, 2010 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> and it is now available for Kindle Fire and Nook. (The Nook version is not available outside the US). A further 71 apps are available which use the Wolfram Alpha engine for specialized tasks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://products.wolframalpha.com/mobile/ |title=Wolfram&#124;Alpha: Mobile & Tablet Apps |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-02-09 |publisher=Wolfram Alpha}}</ref>

== Wolfram Alpha Pro ==
On February 8, 2012, Wolfram Alpha Pro was released,<ref name="WAProAnnounce">{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Wolfram |url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2012/02/08/announcing-wolframalpha-pro/ |title=Announcing Wolfram&#124;Alpha Pro |date=February 8, 2012 |work=Wolfram&#124;Alpha Blog |publisher=Wolfram Alpha |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> offering users additional features for a monthly subscription fee. A key feature is the ability to upload many common file types and data—including raw tabular data, images, audio, XML, and dozens of specialized scientific, medical, and mathematical formats—for automatic analysis. Other features include an extended keyboard, interactivity with [[Computable Document Format|CDF]], data downloads, in-depth step by step solution, the ability to customize and save graphical and tabular results<ref name="Hachman">{{cite news |last=Hachman |first=Mark |title=Data Geeks, Meet Wolfram Alpha Pro |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |date=February 7, 2012 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399911,00.asp |accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> and extra computation time.<ref name="WAProAnnounce" />

Along with new premium features, Wolfram Alpha Pro led to some changes in the free version of the site:
* An increase in advertisements on the free site.
* Text and PDF export options now require the user to set up a free account<ref name="WAProAnnounce" /> even though they existed before the introduction of Wolfram Alpha accounts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2009/06/24/users-guide-wolframalpha/|title=A User's Guide to Wolfram Alpha|first=Surfdaddy|last=Orca|publisher=H+ Magazine|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2013-04-24}}</ref>
