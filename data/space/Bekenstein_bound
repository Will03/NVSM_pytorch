__NOTOC__
In [[physics]], the '''Bekenstein bound''' is an upper limit on the [[entropy]] ''S'', or [[information]] ''I'', that can be contained within a given finite region of space which has a finite amount of energy—or conversely, the maximum amount of information required to perfectly describe a given physical system down to the quantum level.<ref name="Bekenstein1981-1">Jacob D. Bekenstein, [http://www.phys.huji.ac.il/~bekenste/PRD23-287-1981.pdf "Universal upper bound on the entropy-to-energy ratio for bounded systems"], ''[[Physical Review|Physical Review D]]'', Vol. 23, No. 2, (January 15, 1981), pp. 287-298, {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevD.23.287}}, {{bibcode|1981PhRvD..23..287B}}. [https://www.webcitation.org/5pvt5c96N?url=http://www.phys.huji.ac.il/%7Ebekenste/PRD23-287-1981.pdf Mirror link].</ref> It implies that the information of a physical system, or the information necessary to perfectly describe that system, must be finite if the region of space and the energy is finite. In [[computer science]], this implies that there is a maximum information-processing rate ([[Bremermann's limit]]) for a physical system that has a finite size and energy, and that a [[Turing machine]] with finite physical dimensions and unbounded memory is not physically possible.

Upon exceeding the Bekenstein bound a storage medium would collapse into a [[black hole]].<ref>http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2014/04/is-information-fundamental/</ref>

==Equations==
The universal form of the bound was originally found by [[Jacob Bekenstein]] as the [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]<ref name="Bekenstein1981-1"/><ref name="Bekenstein2005"/><ref name="Bekenstein2008"/>

:<math>S \leq \frac{2 \pi k R E}{\hbar c}</math>

where ''S'' is the [[entropy]], ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''R'' is the [[radius]] of a [[sphere]] that can enclose the given system, ''E'' is the total [[mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy]] including any [[invariant mass|rest masses]], ''ħ'' is the [[Planck constant#Reduced Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]], and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. Note that while gravity plays a significant role in its enforcement, the expression for the bound does not contain the [[gravitational constant]]&nbsp;''G''.

In informational terms, the bound is given by

:<math>I \leq \frac{2 \pi R E}{\hbar c \ln 2}</math>

where ''I'' is the [[information]] expressed in number of [[bit]]s contained in the quantum states in the sphere. The [[Natural logarithm|ln]] 2 factor comes from defining the information as the [[logarithm]] to the [[radix|base]] [[Binary numeral system|2]] of the number of quantum states.<ref name="Tipler2005b">[[Frank J.

:<math>I \leq \frac{2 \pi c R m}{\hbar \ln 2} \approx 2.5769082\times 10^{43} m R</math>

where <math>m</math> is the mass of the system in kilograms, and the radius <math>R</math> is expressed in meters.

==Origins==
Bekenstein derived the bound from heuristic arguments involving [[black hole]]s. If a system exists that violates the bound, i.e., by having too much entropy, Bekenstein argued that it would be possible to violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]] by lowering it into a black hole. In 1995, [[Theodore Jacobson|Ted Jacobson]] demonstrated that the [[Einstein field equations]] (i.e., [[general relativity]]) can be derived by assuming that the Bekenstein bound and the [[laws of thermodynamics]] are true.<ref name="Jacobson1995">[[Theodore Jacobson|Ted Jacobson]], "Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State", ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', Vol. 75, Issue 7 (August 14, 1995), pp. 1260-1263, {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1260}}, {{bibcode|1995PhRvL..75.1260J}}.

Phys.'' paper (or p. 9 of the ''arXiv'' version), and the discussions on the Bekenstein bound that follow throughout the paper.</ref>

==Examples==
===Black holes===
It happens that the [[Black_hole_thermodynamics#Black_hole_entropy|Bekenstein-Hawking Boundary Entropy]] of three-dimensional [[black hole]]s exactly saturates the bound

:<math>r_s = \frac{2 G M}{c^2}</math>
:<math>A = 4 \pi r_s^2 = \frac{16 \pi G^2 M^2}{c^4}</math>
:<math>l_P^2 = \hbar G/c^3</math>
:<math>S =\frac{kA}{4 l_P^2} = \frac{4 \pi k G M^2}{\hbar c}</math>

where <math>k</math> is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''A'' is the two-dimensional area of the black hole's event horizon in units of the [[Planck area]], <math>l_P^2 = \hbar G/c^3</math>.

The bound is closely associated with [[black hole thermodynamics]], the [[holographic principle]] and the [[covariant entropy bound]] of quantum gravity, and can be derived from a conjectured strong form of the latter.

===Human brain===
An average [[human brain]] has a mass of 1.5&nbsp;kg and a volume of 1260&nbsp;cm{{sup|3}}. If the brain is approximated by a sphere, then [[Sphere#Volume_of_a_sphere|the radius will be]] 6.7 cm.

The informational Bekenstein bound will be <math>\approx 2.6 \times 10^{42}</math> bits and represents the maximum information needed to perfectly recreate an average human brain down to the quantum level. This means that the number <math>O=2^I</math> of [[quantum state|states]] of the human brain must be less than <math>\approx 10^{7.8 \times 10^{41}}</math>.
