'''David McGoveran''' (born 1952)  is an American computer scientist and physicist, software industry analyst, and inventor. In computer science, he is recognized as one of the pioneers of [[relational database]] theory. In the field of physics, his most notable work is in discrete and [[bit-string physics]], in which he derived fundamental dimensionless constants from first principles.

== Education ==
David McGoveran majored in physics and mathematics, and minored in [[cognition]] and communication at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1973 to 1976, with graduate studies in physics and [[psycholinguistics]]. He pursued additional graduate studies from 1976 to 1979 at [[Stanford University]].

== Career ==
While a student he was employed by the [[Enrico Fermi Institute]]'s Laboratory for Astrophysics and Space Research (Chicago 1973-4), [[Dow Chemical Company]]'s Western Applied Science and Technology Laboratories (Walnut Creek, CA 1974), and [[University of Chicago Hospitals]] and Clinics (1975-6). After graduation from University of Chicago, he founded the consulting firm of Alternative Technologies<ref>[http://www.AlternativeTech.com]</ref>(Menlo Park, CA 1976) under the mentoring of [[H. Dean Brown]] and Dr. [[Cuthbert Hurd]]. While starting his consulting practice, he worked at [[SRI International]] (1976-9), his first consulting client.<ref>[http://www.dbdebunk.com/2015/04/david-mcgoveran-interview.html#more Pascal, F.

He has chaired various professional conferences (1975-2001). He assesses software opportunities and risks for vendors, [[venture capital]]ists and other investors; and occasionally serves as an expert in software [[intellectual property]] litigation.

== Research ==

=== Mathematical Logic ===
Work on applications of [[mathematical logic]] has pervaded Mr. McGoveran's career (1971–present). He has done original research and published on the structure of [[paradoxes]],<ref>McGoveran, D.

=== Discrete Physics ===
Beginning in 1974, Mr. McGoveran began researching quantum logic and new approaches to [[discrete mathematics]] (especially for physics). He became acquainted with, and starting working with, the [[combinatorial hierarchy]] and [[Ted Bastin|E. W. "Ted" Bastin]], [[Frederick Parker-Rhodes]], John Amson, and [[Clive W. Kilmister]] through [[H. Pierre Noyes]] in 1980 and began applying his own work on discrete mathematics to physics. He worked with H. Pierre Noyes starting in 1982 in the Theory Group at [[SLAC]] (Stanford University), making contributions to the discrete mathematical foundations of physics (e.g., [[bit-string physics]]),<ref>Noyes, H. P., et al. (2001). "Bit-String Physics: A Finite and Discrete Approach to Natural Philosophy". Series on Knots and Everything. Vol. 27. World Scientific Publishing Co. Inc. Singapore. {{ISBN|9810246110}}.</ref><ref>McGoveran, D. (2013). Ordering Operators: Towards a Discrete, Strictly Finite and Quantized Interpretation of the Tensor Calculus. In Amson, J. C., Kauffman, L. H. (Eds.)  Scientific Essays in Honor of H. Pierre Noyes, New York, London, and Singapore: World Scientific Publishing Co. Inc. {{ISBN|981457936X}} & {{ISBN|978-9814579360}}.</ref> and was invited to be [[Visiting Scholar]] (1986-1992). The work Prephysics (with Chris Gefwert and H. Pierre Noyes)<ref>Gefwert, C., McGoveran, D., Noyes, H. P. (1989). Prephysics. SLAC-PUB-4525. Stanford, CA: SLAC Theory Group, Stanford University.</ref> discusses a [[philosophy of science]] behind discrete physics, including McGoveran's multidisciplinary modeling methodology. In Foundations of a Discrete Physics<ref>McGoveran, D., Noyes, H.P. (June, 1989). Foundations for a Discrete Physics. SLAC-PUB-4526. Stanford, CA: SLAC Theory Group, Stanford University.</ref> a [[pregeometry (physics)|pregeometry]] and purely discrete and finite justification for [[differential geometry]] (called the ordering operator calculus) is developed from first principles and applied it to physics. The work includes a purely combinatorial derivation of the [[parallel transport]] operator, shows that the construction of certain discrete analogs to velocity intrinsically obey [[Lorentz invariance]], while giving [[canonical commutation relation|commutation relations]], and the [[uncertainty principle]]. The [[topological spaces]] so generated may be multiply connected (as contrasted with [[simply connected]]). The relationship to Noyes' bit-string physics is explained. Subsequently McGoveran developed a [[combinatorial]] and [[phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] argument for computing the [[fine structure constant]] from the combinatorial hierarchy, accurate to four decimal places. While suggestive, the argument was not considered convincing.<ref>McGoveran, D., Noyes, H.P. (March 1989). Physical Numerology? SLAC-PUB-4929. Stanford, CA: SLAC Theory Group, Stanford University.</ref>

In 1988, he used similar methods to develop a new derivation of the Fine Structure Spectrum of Hydrogen,<ref>McGoveran, D. (1988). The Fine Structure of Hydrogen. In Kilmister, C. W. (Ed.).  Discrete Physics and Beyond: Proc. ANPA 10. Cambridge University, UK: ANPA.</ref> which was further developed and published with H.P.Noyes.<ref>Noyes, H. P., McGoveran, D. (1991) On the Fine Structure Spectrum of Hydrogen. SLAC-PUB 4730. Stanford, CA: SLAC Theory Group, Stanford University.</ref> In later work,<ref>McGoveran, D. (1989). Advances in the Foundations. In Manthey, M. (Ed.). "Objects in Discrete Physics: Proc. ANPA 11". (pp. 82-100). Cambridge University, UK: ANPA.</ref> the approach was shown to support [[Feynman checkerboard|Feynman sum-over-paths]] in 1+1 dimensions and gave the solution to the [[Dirac equation]] ([[Green's function]]). Noyes has cited McGoveran's calculation of the [[Old quantum theory|Sommerfeld-Dirac]] formula and corrections to both the combinatorial hierarchy computation of the fine structure and gravitational constants as convincing him that the evolving combinatorial hierarchy construction could be the starting point for a new physics and physical cosmology.<ref>Noyes, H.

=== Transaction Management ===
Beginning in 1981,<ref>[http://www.dbdebunk.com/2015/04/david-mcgoveran-interview.html#more Pascal, F. (April 11, 2015). An Interview with David McGoveran. "Database Debunkings".]</ref><ref>[http://www.alternativetech.com Alternative Technologies.]</ref> Mr. McGoveran began consulting on the design of transaction processing systems, including [[distributed transactions]]. Investigations into the complexity and cost of distributed transactions, as well as the difficulty of maintaining transactional consistency in online applications led to research into alternatives to the traditional transaction models that used pessimistic [[concurrency control]] and enforced [[ACID]] properties.<ref>McGoveran, D. (Nov. 2007). Beyond ACID: An Adaptive Approach To Transaction Management. "Middleware Spectra", 21(4). (pp. 14-23).]</ref> McGoveran defined physical transactions as the unit of recovery, logical transactions as the unit of consistency, and business transactions as the unit of audit<ref>McGoveran, D. (2004). Understanding Business Transactions. "Business Integration Journal". Vol. 5. Dallas, TX: Thomas Communications.</ref> The resulting adaptive transaction model introduces a transaction intrinsic definition of consistency, deferring the decision to combine the results of two or more transactions.  His work on transaction management resulted in the award of US Patent No 7,103,597.<ref>McGoveran, D. (2002) Adaptive Transaction Manager for Complex Transactions and Business Processes. US Patent No 7,103,597. Washington, DC: US Patent and Trademark Office.</ref>

=== Relational Data Model and Related Research ===
McGoveran's research on [[E.F. Codd]]'s [[relational model]] has focused on the issues of data modeling (database design), [[relational model#History|missing information]], and view updating. The last two are considered by some database researchers to be the most difficult and controversial problems in relational database research.<ref>[ Date, C. J. (December 20, 2012). "View Updating and Relational Theory". Forward by Hugh Darwen. p. xv. Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media. {{ISBN|1449357849}} & {{ISBN|978-1449357849}}.]</ref>

Having worked on the design and development of several early large scale, distributed, commercial relational database applications,<ref>[http://www.dbdebunk.com/2015/04/david-mcgoveran-interview.html#more Pascal, F. (April 11, 2015). An Interview with David ]</ref><ref>[http://www.alternativetech.com Alternative Technologies.]</ref> McGoveran sought to improve upon the science of [[database design]]. This work lead to the development of  
#new analyses of and solutions to the problem of "missing information" and avoiding the use of [[null (SQL)|nulls]]  and therefore many-valued logic
#the specification and uses of relation predicates (relation or set membership functions) as an application of [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz' Law]]<ref>Date, C. J., McGoveran, D. (July, 1994).

Updating Joins and Other Views. Database Programming & Design. San Francisco, CA: Miller-Freeman.</ref> 
#a new design principle (with [[Christopher J. Date|C. J. Date]]) now known as the [[Principle of Orthogonal Design]] (POOD)

His work on logic applied to relational databases and on design without nulls (1993) has been republished several times.<ref>McGoveran, D., (Dec.1993-Mar. 1994) Nothing from Nothing. "Database Programming & Design". San Francisco, CA: Miller-Freeman. (in four parts).</ref><ref>Date, C. J. (1998) "Relational Database Writings 1994-1997". Reading, MA: Longman Pub. Group. ({{ISBN|0201398141}} & {{ISBN|978-0201398144}}).</ref>

McGoveran tackled the problem of view updating with [[Christopher J. Date]] starting in 1993 after having developed methods for reversible schema migration for clients on Wall Street.<ref>[http://www.dbdebunk.com/2015/04/david-mcgoveran-interview.html#more Pascal, F. (April 11, 2015). An Interview with David McGoveran. "Database Debunkings".]</ref>  His solution, based on relation predicates, formed the basis for the algorithms found in [[The Third Manifesto]] (Christopher J. Date, [[Hugh Darwen]]) for updating virtual relations (e.g., views). Date has credited McGoveran with originally suggesting the basic idea for the view updating approach,<ref>Date, C. J. (December 20, 2012). "View Updating and Relational Theory". Preface. p. xiv. Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media. {{ISBN|1449357849}} & {{ISBN|978-1449357849}}.</ref> and which Hugh Darwen<ref>[Date, C. J. (December 20, 2012). "View Updating and Relational Theory". Forward by Hugh Darwen. p. xv. Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media. {{ISBN|1449357849}} & {{ISBN|978-1449357849}}.</ref> says represented a major shift in thinking on the issue. This work has resulted in two [[David McGoveran#Inventions and Products|patents]] (U.S. Patent 7,620,664 and U.S. Patent 7,263,512).

Some of McGoveran's work on databases is discussed at [[Fabian Pascal]]'s Database Debunkings.<ref>[http://www.dbdebunk.com/2015/04/david-mcgoveran-interview.html#more Pascal, F. (April 11, 2015). An Interview with David McGoveran. "Database Debunkings".]</ref>

=== EAI and Business Process Management ===
After consulting on numerous [[data integration]] and [[enterprise application integration]] projects, and related [[middleware]] products, McGoveran recognized that process aspects of integration were largely overlooked.<ref>[http://www.dbdebunk.com/2015/04/david-mcgoveran-interview.html#more Pascal, F. (April 11, 2015). An Interview with David McGoveran. "Database Debunkings".]</ref><ref>[http://www.alternativetech.com Alternative Technologies.]</ref> Most [[business process]] technology focused on analyzing and documenting existing business processes, then manually "[[business process reengineering|reengineering]]" the processes to eliminate waste, remove bottlenecks, and improve cycle times. These efforts were largely disjoint from [[process automation system]]s and [[distributed control system]]s (which focused on highly repetitive, often continuous processes), and [[workflow]] technologies (which focused on highly repetitive sequential processes like document processing).

McGoveran postulated<ref>[http://www.dbdebunk.com/2015/04/david-mcgoveran-interview.html#more Pascal, F. (April 11, 2015). An Interview with David McGoveran. "Database Debunkings".]</ref> an analogy between data management and process management.<ref>McGoveran, D. (1999). Think BPMS! McGoveran, D. (2004). Understanding Business Transactions. "eAI Journal". Vol. 1. Dallas, TX: Thomas Communications.</ref> Just as the relational data model proposed separating the logical model of the data from the physical storage model, it seemed that a logical process model (i.e., the business process model) should be separated from its physical implementation (e.g., as messaging, remote invocation, services, etc.). As with the relational model, this would permit [[Business process modeling|business process design via models]] that were logically separated from specifics of process implementation, process scheduling, and [[process optimization]]. By introducing process measurement and analytics into the proposed [[process management]] system, [[control theory|closed loop process control]]  became theoretically possible.  The result was a set of requirements and a canonical architecture for the then largely unknown [[business process management]] system (BPMS).

The first commercial package compliant with this BPMS architecture ChangEngine - was then built and introduced by Hewlett-Packard in 1997-98 under McGoveran's direction.<ref>[http://invent3k.openmpe.com/cslproceed/HPW98CD/5000/5285/ppt/index.htm Jannasch, D. (1998). "Proceedings of HP World '98". San Diego, CA: Hewlett-Packard.]</ref> Subsequently, McGoveran introduced these concepts at DCI's EAI conference in 1999,<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/application-server-workshop-and-enterprise-application-integration-conference-to-premiere-in-1999-73352192.html  (Jan. 7, 1999).

Alternative Technologies Publications Directory.]</ref> and worked with companies like IBM, Vitria, Candle, Fuego, Savvion, and numerous others to help shape the market and the BPM category.<ref>[http://www.dbdebunk.com/2015/04/david-mcgoveran-interview.html#more Pascal, F. (April 11, 2015). An Interview with David McGoveran. "Database Debunkings".]</ref> Many workflow and business process reengineering (BPR) companies joined in the effort, transforming themselves into BPM companies during the period 1999-2010.

*Relational Access Manager
**In 1986 McGoveran developed the Relational Access Manager (RAM), middleware software<ref>[http://www.dbdebunk.com/2015/04/david-mcgoveran-interview.html#more Pascal, F. (April 11, 2015). An Interview with David McGoveran. "Database Debunkings".]</ref><ref>[http://www.AlterantiveTech.com/ATpubs_dir.html McGoveran, D., (1988). Relational Access Manager User's Manual. Alternative Technologies Publications Directory.]</ref> that enabled programmers to develop programs in FORTRAN, COBOL, C, C++, and other languages without having to know a query language such as SQL or QUEL. Based on external specifications, RAM mapped a program's internal data structures (e.g., objects, linked lists, trees, etc.) to and from relational database and executed packaged sequences of query language statements by name. It served as an isolation layer between client-side programs and server-side (or local) DBMS software, so that programs could be independent of the peculiarities of a specific DBMS, its query language dialect, and API. By the summer of 1988, the trade secret software had been licensed to Goldman Sachs and Pacific Telesis.  In 1989, Pacific Telesis reverse engineered RAM and disclosed it to Alternative Technologies' competitors, resulting in a trade secret misappropriation lawsuit. The lawsuit was finally won by Alternative Technologies in 1996, though at the cost of bringing RAM further to market.<ref>McGoveran vs Pacific Telesis Group; Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, Case No. CGC 89 912650</ref>
