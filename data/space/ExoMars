'''ExoMars''' ('''Exobiology on Mars''') is a two-part [[astrobiology]] project to search for evidence of [[life on Mars]], a joint mission of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and the Russian space agency [[Roscosmos]]. The first part, launched in 2016, placed the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] into Mars orbit and released the [[Schiaparelli EDM lander]] (which crashed). The second part is planned to launch in 2020 and to land the [[ExoMars rover]] on the surface, supporting a [[Exploration of Mars|science mission]] that is expected to last into 2022 or beyond.<ref name="NYT-20161019">{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=ExoMars Mission to Join Crowd of Spacecraft at Mars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/science/esa-mars-lander.html |date=19 October 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=19 October 2016 }}</ref><ref name="ESA signed">{{cite news |title=ExoMars: ESA and Roscosmos set for Mars missions |date=14 March 2013 |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars_ESA_and_Roscosmos_set_for_Mars_missions |work=European Space Agency (ESA)}}</ref><ref name="On track">{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |title=Europe |date=18 June 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22914025 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Oberhausen - Gasometer - Sternstunden 33 ies.jpg|thumb|An ExoMars rover as an exhibit at [[Gasometer Oberhausen]], Germany]]
Since its inception, ExoMars has gone through several phases of planning with various proposals for landers, orbiters, launch vehicles, and international cooperation planning,<ref name="ExoMars">{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/exomars_2016.html |title=ExoMars |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013 |work=Russian Space Web}}</ref> such as the defunct 2009 [[Mars Exploration Joint Initiative]] (MEJI) with the United States.<ref name="CNet">{{cite news |first=William |last=Harwood |title=NASA budget boosts manned space, cuts Mars exploration |date=13 February 2012 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19514_3-57377062-239/nasa-budget-boosts-manned-space-cuts-mars-exploration/ |work=C Net News |quote="Tough choices had to be made," Bolden said.

Originally, the ExoMars concept consisted of a large robotic rover being part of ESA's [[Aurora Programme]] as a ''Flagship mission'' and was approved by the European Space Agency ministers in December 2005. Originally conceived as a rover with a stationary ground station, ExoMars was planned to launch in 2011 aboard a Russian [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]] [[Fregat]] rocket.<ref name="Europe's ExoMars rover">{{cite web |title=Europe's ExoMars rover... |date=28 August 2005 |url=http://www.spacetoday.org/SolSys/Mars/MarsExploration/MarsEuroRover.html |work=Space Today Online}}</ref>

In 2007, Canadian-based technology firm MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA) was selected for a one-million-euro contract with [[EADS Astrium]] of Britain to design and build a prototype Mars rover chassis for the European Space Agency. Astrium was also contracted to design the final rover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=67e4d15d-5ecc-4db8-9fe3-f5d904694950&k=48686 |title=B.C. robotics firm lands Martian contract |publisher=CanWest News Service |date=18 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124024833/http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=67e4d15d-5ecc-4db8-9fe3-f5d904694950&k=48686 |archivedate=24 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On July 2009 NASA and ESA signed the [[Mars Exploration Joint Initiative]], which proposed to utilise an Atlas rocket launcher instead of a Soyuz, which significantly altered the technical and financial setting of the ExoMars mission. On 19 June, when the rover was still planned to piggyback the [[Mars Trace Gas Orbiter]], it was reported that a prospective agreement would require that ExoMars lose enough weight to fit aboard the Atlas launch vehicle with a NASA orbiter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/nasa-could-take-role-european-exomars-mission.html |title=NASA Could Take Role in European ExoMars Mission |work=Space News |date=19 June 2009}}</ref>
[[File:MAX-C-Rover.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher]] (MAX-C) rover]]
Then the mission was combined with other projects to a multi-spacecraft mission divided over two [[Atlas V]]-launches:<ref name="oct-proposal">{{cite news |first=Michael A. |last=Taverna |authorlink= |title=ESA Proposes Two ExoMars Missions |date=19 October 2009 |publisher=[[Aviation Week]] |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&id=news/Exomars101909.xml&headline=ESA%20Proposes%20Two%20ExoMars%20Missions |work=}}</ref><ref name="oct-proposal"/><ref name=oct12 >{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |authorlink= |title=Europe's Mars plans move forward |date=12 October 2009 |publisher= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8302876.stm |work=BBC News}}</ref> the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] (TGO) was merged into the project, piggybacking a stationary meteorological lander slated for launch in January 2016. It was also proposed to include a second rover, the [[Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher|MAX-C]].

In August 2009 it was announced that the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (now Roscosmos) and ESA had signed a contract that included cooperation on two Mars exploration projects: Russia's [[Fobos-Grunt]] project and ESA's ExoMars. Specifically, ESA secured a Russian [[Proton (rocket)|Proton rocket]] as a "backup launcher" for the ExoMars rover, which would include Russian-made parts.<ref name=avio >{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Agreement between ESA and Roscosmos signed at "MAKS 2009" |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=Avio News |url=http://www.avionews.com/index.php?corpo=see_news_home.php&news_id=1108379&pagina_chiamante=index.php |work=WAPA}}</ref><ref name=red >{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=ESA, Roscosmos Strike Mars Deal |date=20 August 2009 |publisher= |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1740298/esa_roscosmos_strike_mars_deal/ |work=Red Orbit}}</ref>

On 17 December 2009, the ESA governments gave their final approval to a two-part Mars exploration mission to be conducted with NASA, confirming their commitment to spend €850 million ($1.23 billion) on missions in 2016 and 2018.<ref>{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |title=ESA Approves Collaborative Mars Program with NASA |date=18 December 2009 |url=http://www.space.com/news/091218-exomars-mission.html |work=Space News}}</ref>

In April 2011, because of a budgeting crisis, a proposal was announced to cancel the accompanying [[Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher|MAX-C]] rover, and fly only one rover in 2018 that would be larger than either of the vehicles in the paired concept.<ref name="single rover">{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |title=US and Europe mull single 2018 Mars rover |date=7 April 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13002214 |work=BBC News}}</ref> One suggestion was that the new vehicle would be built in Europe and carry a mix of European and U.S. instruments. NASA would provide the rocket to deliver it to Mars and provide the [[Mars Science Laboratory#Sky crane landing|sky crane landing system]]. Despite the proposed reorganisation, the goals of the 2018 mission opportunity would have stayed broadly the same.<ref name="single rover" />

ESA had originally cost-capped the ExoMars projects at €1 billion, ([[USD]] 1.3 billion) but the withdrawal of the U.S. space agency ([[NASA]]) and the consequent reorganisation of the ventures will probably add several hundred million euros to the sum so far raised.<ref name="still keen" /> So on March 2012, member states instructed the agency's executive to look at how this shortfall could be made up.<ref>{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |title=ESA Eyeing Hodgepodge of Funding Sources To Save ExoMars Mission |date=31 May 2012 |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/120531-hodgepodge-funding-save-exomars.html |work=Space News}}</ref> One possibility is that other science activities within ESA may have to step back to make ExoMars a priority.<ref name="still keen" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/120516-exomars-one-month-reprieve.html |title=ExoMars Wins One-month Reprieve |work=Space News |date=16 May 2012}}</ref> On September 2012 it was announced that new ESA members, Poland and Romania will be contributing up to €70 million to the ExoMars mission.<ref>{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |title=Poland Tripling Space Spending in Bid To Boost Economy |date=19 September 2012 |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/120919-poland-tripling-space-spending.html |work=Space News}}</ref> ESA has not ruled out a possible partial return of NASA to the 2018 portion of ExoMars, albeit in a relatively minor role.<ref name="still keen" /><ref name="Selding" /><ref name="Morning">{{cite news |first=Frank |last=Morring, Jr. |title=Appropriators Blocking Mars Mission Move |date=8 March 2012 |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&id=news/awx/2012/03/08/awx_03_08_2012_p0-434301.xml&headline=Appropriators%20Blocking%20Mars%20Mission%20Move |work=[[Aviation Week]]}}</ref>

The two landing modules and the rover will be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilised]] in order not to contaminate the planet with Earth life forms. Cleaning will require a combination of sterilising methods, including [[ionising radiation]], [[UV]] radiation, and chemicals such as ethyl and isopropyl alcohol.<ref name="Proton+BrizM" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-10-mars.html |title=Packing for Mars |work=Pys Org |date=22 October 2014 |accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref> ''(see [[Planetary protection]])''.

=== First launch (2016) ===

==== Trace Gas Orbiter ====
{{Main article|ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter}}

The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) is a Mars telecommunications orbiter and atmospheric gas analyzer mission that was launched on 14 March 2016.<ref name="Sputnik">{{cite news |url=http://sputniknews.com/science/20150918/1027214512.html |title=Russian, EU Space Agencies Propose to Delay Joint Mission to Mars |work=Sputnik News |location=Moskow |date=18 September 2015 |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Stephen |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/09/20/launch-of-european-mars-mission-delayed-two-months/ |title=Launch of European Mars mission delayed two months |work=Spaceflight Now |date=20 September 2015 |accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> The spacecraft arrived in the Martian orbit in October 2016. It delivered the ExoMars Schiaparelli EDM lander and then proceed to map the sources of [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane on Mars]] and other gases, and in doing so, help select the landing site for the ExoMars [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] to be launched in 2020. The presence of methane in Mars' atmosphere is intriguing because its likely origin is either present-day life or geological activity. Upon the arrival of the rover in 2021, the orbiter would be transferred into a lower orbit where it would be able to perform analytical science activities as well as provide the Schiaparelli EDM lander and ExoMars rover with telecommunication relay. NASA provided an ''Electra'' telecommunications relay and navigation instrument to ensure communications between probes and rovers on the surface of Mars and controllers on Earth.<ref name="ESA signed" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |title=U.S., Europe Won't Go It Alone in Mars Exploration |date=26 September 2012 |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/120926-us-europe-mars-exploration.html |work=Space News}}</ref> The TGO would continue serving as a telecommunication relay satellite for future landed missions until 2022.<ref name="June 2011">{{citation |first=Mark |last=Allen |first2=Olivier |last2=Witasse |title=MEPAG June 2011 |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=16 June 2011 |url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/jun-11/13-EMTGO_MEPAG_June2011_presentation-rev2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929004716/http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/jun-11/13-EMTGO_MEPAG_June2011_presentation-rev2.pdf|archive-date=September 29, 2011}}</ref>

=== Second launch (2020) ===

==== Russian landing system ====

The second mission, scheduled for launch in July 2020, will have an 1800&nbsp;kg Russian-built landing platform system derived from the 2016 Schiaparelli EDM lander, to place the [[ExoMars rover]] on the surface of Mars.<ref name="On track" /><ref name="LaunchMoved2020"/><ref name="LanderAmos">{{cite news |first=Jonthan |last=Amos |title=Looking forward to Europe's 'seven minutes of terror' |date=21 June 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23010103 |work=BBC News}}</ref> This lander platform will be built 80% by the Russian company [[Lavochkin]], and 20% by ESA.<ref name="Selding" /> Lavochkin will produce most of the landing system's hardware, while ESA will handle elements such as the guidance, radar and navigation systems.<ref name="still keen" /> Lavochkin's current landing strategy is to use two parachutes; one will open while the module is still moving at supersonic speed, and another will deploy once the probe has been slowed down to subsonic velocity. The heat shield will eventually fall away from the entry capsule to allow the ExoMars rover, riding its retro-rocket-equipped lander, to come for a soft landing on legs or struts. The surface platform lander will then deploy ramps for the rover to drive down.<ref name="LanderAmos" />

Critics have stated that while Russian expertise may be sufficient to provide a launch vehicle, it does not currently extend to the critical requirement of a landing system for Mars.<ref name="LanderAmos" /><ref>{{cite news |title=NASA drops ExoMars missions in 2013 budget |url=http://optics.org/news/3/2/23 |work=Optics |date=15 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/16/spacewatch-nasa-mars-exomars |title=Uncertainties for ExoMars |first=Alan |last=Pickup |work=Spacewatch |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=16 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archivedate=17 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317113819/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/mar/16/spacewatch-nasa-mars-exomars}}</ref>

==== Surface platform ====
{{main article|ExoMars 2020 surface platform}}

After landing on Mars in 2021, the rover will descend from the platform via a ramp. The platform is expected to image the landing site, monitor the climate, investigate the atmosphere, analyse the radiation environment, study the distribution of any subsurface water at the landing site, and perform geophysical investigations of the internal structure of Mars.<ref name="2018 lander payload">{{cite news |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/European_payload_selected_for_ExoMars_2018_surface_platform |title=European payload selected for ExoMars 2018 surface platform |work=European Space Agency (ESA) |date=27 November 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref> Following a March 2015 request for the contribution of scientific instruments for the landing system,<ref name="2018Platform">{{cite news |url=http://exploration.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=55672 |title=Announcement of Opportunity for European payload elements on the Surface Platform of the ExoMars 2018 mission |work=European Space Agency (ESA) |date=31 March 2015 |accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> there will be 13 instruments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/56933-exomars-2020-surface-platform/|title=ExoMars 2020 surface platform|website=exploration.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> Examples of the instruments on the lander include the [[HABIT (HabitAbility: Brine, Irradiation and Temperature)]] package, the METEO meteorological package, the MAIGRET magnetometer, and the [[LaRa|LaRa (Lander Radioscience)]] experiment.

The platform is expected to operate for at least one Earth year, and its instruments will be powered by solar arrays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/media/news/news-231116|title=ISS-Reshetnev chosen for ExoMars-2020 project|last=JSC ISS–Reshetnev|first=|date=|website=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref>

The ExoMar's rover includes the Pasteur instrument suite, including the [[Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer]] (MOMA), [[MicrOmega-IR]], and the [[Raman Laser Spectrometer]] (RLS). Examples of external instruments on the rover include:
*[[Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies]]
*[[Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars]]
*[[ADRON-RM]]

== Landing site selection ==
[[File:NASA-OxiaPlanum-GeologicalContext-Morphology-20140514.jpg|thumb|300px| [[Oxia Planum]], near the equator, is the selected landing site for its potential to preserve biosignatures and smooth surface ]]

A primary goal when selecting the rover's landing site is to identify a particular geologic environment, or set of environments, that would support —now or in the past— microbial life. The scientists prefer a landing site with both morphologic and mineralogical evidence for past water. Furthermore, a site with spectra indicating multiple [[Mineral hydration|hydrated minerals]] such as [[clay minerals]] is preferred, but it will come down to a balance between engineering constraints and scientific goals.<ref name="site selection 2014">{{cite news |last=Grindrod |first=Peter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2014/mar/26/life-mars-exomars-spacecraft-landing-site |title=Searching for life on Mars: where should the ExoMars rover land? |work=The Guardian |date=26 March 2014}}</ref>

Engineering constraints call for a flat landing site in a latitude band straddling the equator that is only 30° latitude from top to bottom because the rover is solar-powered and will need best sunlight exposure.<ref name="site selection 2014" /> The landing module carrying the rover will have a landing ellipse that measures about 105&nbsp;km by 15&nbsp;km.<ref name="Sites March 2014">{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26743089 |title=Europe begins Mars site selection |work=BBC News |date=27 March 2014}}</ref>

Following additional review by an ESA-appointed panel, four sites, all of which are located relatively near the equator, were formally recommended in October 2014 for further detailed analysis:<ref name="4 candidate sites">{{cite news |url=http://spaceref.com/mars/four-candidate-landing-sites-for-exomars-2018.html |title=Four Candidate Landing Sites for ExoMars 2018 |work=ESA |publisher=Space Ref |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=54707 |title=Recommendation for the Narrowing of ExoMars 2018 Landing Sites |work=ESA |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>

The delay of the rover mission to 2020 from 2018 meant that Oxia Planum was no longer the only favourable landing site due to changes in the possible [[Landing footprint|landing ellipse]]. Both Mawrth Vallis and Aram Dorsum, surviving candidates from the previous selection, could be reconsidered. ESA convened further workshops to re-evaluate the three remaining options and in March 2017 selected two sites to study in detail <ref name="2 sites">{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/Final_two_ExoMars_landing_sites_chosen|title=Final two ExoMars landing sites chosen|date=28 March 2017|work=[[European Space Agency]]|accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref>.
