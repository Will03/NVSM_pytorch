{{Dynamic list}}
These are a series of incomplete '''lists of fictional astronauts''' appearing in various media, including books, film, television shows (live or animated), radio shows, records, and comic books.

To be included in these lists, a fictional [[astronaut]] must be modeled upon actual astronauts of real-world [[space programs]], as they have actually existed since the beginning of the [[Space Age]], or were envisioned in the years leading up to the Space Age. Criteria include:
# A fictional astronaut must be human (not an alien, robot, or animal).
# A fictional astronaut must be on a flight originating from the Earth; space travellers engaging in casual voyages between other planets (as in ''[[Star Wars]]'' or ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'') are not eligible.
# A fictional astronaut must be presented as living in the period of the early [[space exploration|exploration]] of space, i.e. from the beginning of the [[Space Age]] to the present, and for a few decades into the future; currently, in the period of about 1960–2060.
# A fictional astronaut is preferably part of a real space program, like [[NASA]] or the [[Soviet space program|Soviet]]/[[Russian space program]], or fictional knockoffs of the same (e.g. ANSA, IASA).
# A fictional astronaut preferably uses [[space technology|space travel technology]] within the realm of the possible. Preference should be given to astronauts depicted using real technology (e.g. [[Apollo program|Apollo]], [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]], [[Space Shuttle]]) or close fictional knockoffs of the same.
