[[Image:Patti-presenting-wings-web.jpg|thumb|Patricia G. Smith, Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation at the FAA, presents SpaceShipOne pilot [[Michael Melvill]] the department's first commercial astronaut wings]]A '''commercial astronaut''' is a person trained to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a privately funded [[spacecraft]]. This is distinct from an otherwise non-government astronaut, for example [[Charles D. Walker|Charlie Walker]], who flies while representing a non-government corporation but with funding and/or training coming from government sources.

==Criteria==
The definition of “[[astronaut]]” and the criteria for determining who has achieved [[human spaceflight]] vary. The [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] defines spaceflight as any flight over {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} of altitude. In the [[United States]], professional, military, and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} are eligible to be awarded [[Astronaut Badge|astronaut wings]]. Until 2003, [[astronaut|professional space travelers]] were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, whether by the military or by civilian space agencies. However, with the first sub-orbital flight of the privately funded [[Scaled Composites Tier One]] in 2004, the commercial astronaut category was created.

==FAA Commercial Astronaut rating==
[[File:US - FAA Astronaut Wings.png|right|thumb|FAA Commercial Astronaut Wings]]With the advent of private commercial space flight ventures in the U.S., the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] has been faced with the task of developing a certification process for the pilots of commercial spacecraft. The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 established the FAA's [[Office of Commercial Space Transportation]] and required companies to obtain a [[launch license]] for vehicles, but at the time manned commercial flight - and the licensing of crewmembers - was not considered. The Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act has led to the issuance of draft guidelines by the FAA in February 2005 for the administration of vehicle and crew certifications.<ref>[http://www.faa.gov/airports/regional_guidance/northwest_mountain/airports_news_events/annual_conference/2005/media/commercial_space_nield.ppt ''Commercial Space Flight - New Legislation and the Industry and Developments which Impact Commercial Airports'', FAA NW Mountain Region 2005-04-05, accessed 2007-02-20]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/programs/international_affairs/media/Industry_Standards_paper_IAC_Sept_2013_FAAfinal.pdf|title=IAC-13-E6.4.5 – INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Currently, the FAA has not issued formal regulatory guidance for the issuance of a Commercial Astronaut Certificate, but as an interim measure, has established the practice of awarding "Commercial Astronaut Wings" to commercial pilots who have demonstrated the requisite proficiency. The content of 14 CFR Part 460 implies that an instrument rating and second-class medical certificate issued within the 12 months prior to the proposed qualifying flight will be included as a minimum standard.
