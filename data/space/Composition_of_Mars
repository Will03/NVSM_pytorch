Also like Earth, Mars is a [[planetary differentiation|differentiated planet]], meaning that it has a central [[planetary core|core]] made up of metallic [[iron]] and [[nickel]] surrounded by a less dense, silicate [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[crust (geology)|crust]].<ref name="Nimmo 2005">{{cite journal |last1=Nimmo |first1=Francis |last2=Tanaka |first2=Ken |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.33.092203.122637 |title=Early Crustal Evolution Of Mars |year=2005 |pages=133–161 |issue=1 |volume=33 |journal=[[Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences]] |url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~nimmo/website/version3.doc |bibcode=2005AREPS..33..133N}}</ref> The planet's distinctive red color is due to the [[oxidation]] of iron on its surface.

Much of what we know about the elemental composition of Mars comes from orbiting [[spacecraft]] and landers. (See [[Exploration of Mars]] for list.) Most of these spacecraft carry [[spectrometer]]s and other instruments to measure the surface composition of Mars by either [[remote sensing]] from orbit or ''[[in situ]]'' analyses on the surface. We also have many actual samples of Mars in the form of [[meteorites]] that have made their way to Earth.

Based on these data sources, scientists think that the most abundant chemical elements in the Martian crust, besides silicon and oxygen, are iron, [[magnesium]], [[aluminum]], [[calcium]], and [[potassium]].

Mars is fundamentally an [[Igneous rock|igneous]] planet. Rocks on the surface and in the crust consist predominantly of minerals that crystallize from [[magma]]. Most of our current knowledge about the [[mineral]] composition of Mars comes from spectroscopic data from orbiting spacecraft, ''in situ'' analyses of rocks and soils from six landing sites, and study of the Martian meteorites.<ref>{{cite journal | last1= McSween | first1= Harry Y. | title= SNC Meteorites: Clues to Martian Petrologic Evolution? | journal= Reviews of Geophysics | volume= 23 | issue= 4 |pages= 391–416 | year= 1985 | bibcode = 1985RvGeo..23..391M | doi = 10.1029/RG023i004p00391 }}</ref> Spectrometers currently in orbit include [[THEMIS]] ([[Mars Odyssey]]), OMEGA ([[Mars Express]]), and [[CRISM]] ([[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]).

=== Primary rocks and minerals ===
{{MarsRocks}}
The dark areas of Mars are characterised by the [[mafic]] rock-forming minerals [[olivine]], [[pyroxene]], and [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]. These minerals are the primary constituents of [[basalt]], a dark volcanic rock that also makes up the Earth's oceanic crust and the [[Lunar mare|lunar maria]].
[[File:Olivine valles marineris.jpg|thumb|left|Mars Odyssey THEMIS false-colour image of olivine basalts in the Valles Marineris. Layers rich in olivine appear purple.]]

The mineral olivine occurs all over the planet, but some of the largest concentrations are in [[Nili Fossae]], an area containing [[Noachian]]-aged rocks. Another large olivine-rich outcrop is in [[Ganges Chasma]], an eastern side chasm of [[Valles Marineris]] (pictured).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pretty Green Mineral -- Pretty Dry Mars?|author=Linda M.V.

Therefore, areas with large outcroppings of olivine-bearing rock indicate that liquid water has not been abundant since the rocks formed.<ref name="ISBN 0-8165-1257-4"/>

Pyroxene minerals are also widespread across the surface. Both low-calcium (ortho-) and high-calcium (clino-) pyroxenes are present, with the high-calcium varieties associated with younger [[shield volcano|volcanic shields]] and the low-calcium forms ([[enstatite]]) more common in the old highland terrain. Because enstatite melts at a higher temperature than its high-calcium cousin, some researchers have argued that its presence in the highlands indicates that older magmas on Mars had higher temperatures than younger ones.<ref>Soderblom, L.A.; Bell, J.F.

Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK, p. 11.</ref>
 
Between 1997 and 2006, the [[Thermal Emission Spectrometer]] (TES) on the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] (MGS) spacecraft mapped the global mineral composition of the planet.<ref>Christensen, P.R. et al.

Surface Type 1 (ST1) characterises the Noachian-aged highlands and consists of unaltered plagioclase- and [[clinopyroxene]]-rich basalts. Surface Type 2 (ST2) is common in the younger plains north of the dichotomy boundary and is more silica rich than ST1.[[File:PIA16217-MarsCuriosityRover-1stXRayView-20121017.jpg|thumb|150px|left|First [[X-ray crystallography#Mineralogy and metallurgy|X-ray diffraction view]] of [[Martian soil]] - [[CheMin|CheMin analysis]] reveals [[feldspar]], [[pyroxenes]], [[olivine]] and more ([[Curiosity rover]] at "[[Rocknest (Mars)|Rocknest]]", October 17, 2012).<ref name="NASA-20121030" />]]  The lavas of ST2 have been interpreted as [[andesite]]s or [[basaltic andesite]]s, indicating the lavas in the northern plains originated from more chemically evolved, volatile-rich magmas.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Bandfield | first1=J.

True intermediate and [[felsic]] rocks are present on Mars, but exposures are uncommon. Both TES and the [[Thermal Emission Imaging System]] (THEMIS) on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft have identified high-silica rocks in Syrtis Major and near the southwestern rim of the crater [[Antoniadi (Martian crater)|Antoniadi]]. The rocks have spectra resembling quartz-rich [[dacite]]s and [[granite|granitoids]], suggesting that at least some parts of the Martian crust may have a diversity of igneous rocks similar to Earth's.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Bandfield | first1=Joshua L. | title=Identification of quartzofeldspathic materials on Mars | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research | volume=109 | issue=E10 | pages=E10009 | year=2004 | doi=10.1029/2004JE002290 | bibcode=2004JGRE..10910009B}}</ref> Some geophysical evidence suggests that the bulk of the Martian crust may actually consist of [[basaltic andesite]] or andesite.

Rocks studied by [[Spirit Rover]] in Gusev crater can be classified in different ways.  The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts—also called picritic basalts.  The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic [[komatiites]].  Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic [[shergottite]]s, meteorites which came from Mars.  One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, [[picrobasalt]], and tephite.  The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts.<ref name="McSween 2004">McSween, etal.  2004.  Basaltic Rocks Analyzed by the Spirit Rover in Gusev Crater.  Science : 305. 842-845</ref>

Using SAM’s [[mass spectrometer]], scientists measured [[isotopes]] of [[helium]], [[neon]], and [[argon]] that [[cosmic rays]] produce as they go through rock. The fewer of these isotopes they find, the more recently the rock has been exposed near the surface. The 4-billion-year-old lakebed rock drilled by Curiosity was uncovered between 30 million and 110 million years ago by winds which sandblasted away 2 meters of overlying rock.

Much of the Martian surface is deeply covered by dust as fine as talcum powder. The global predominance of dust obscures the underlying bedrock, making spectroscopic identification of primary minerals impossible from orbit over many areas of the planet. The red/orange appearance of the dust is caused by [[iron(III) oxide]] ([[nanophase]] Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and the [[iron(III) oxide-hydroxide]] mineral [[goethite]].<ref name="Peplow2004">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040503/full/news040503-6.html|doi=10.1038/news040503-6 |title=How Mars got its rust |accessdate=2006-04-18 |last=Peplow |first=Mark |date=2004-05-06 |journal=Nature }}</ref>

The [[Mars Exploration Rovers]] identified [[magnetite]] as the mineral responsible for making the dust magnetic.

The global dust cover and the presence of other wind-blown sediments has made soil compositions remarkably uniform across the Martian surface.

=== Secondary (alteration) minerals ===
Minerals produced through [[hydrothermal alteration]] and [[weathering]] of primary basaltic minerals are also present on Mars. Secondary minerals include [[hematite]], [[phyllosilicates]] (clay minerals), [[goethite]], [[jarosite]], iron [[sulphates|sulfate]] minerals, [[opal|opaline silica]], and [[gypsum]]. Many of these secondary minerals require liquid water to form (aqueous minerals).

Opaline silica and iron sulphate minerals form in acidic (low pH) solutions. Sulphates have been found in a variety of locations, including near [[Juventae Chasma]], [[Ius Chasma]], [[Melas Chasma]], [[Candor Chasma]], and [[Ganges Chasma]]. These sites all contain [[fluvial]] landforms indicating that abundant water was once present.<ref>{{cite journal | last1= Weitz | first1= C.M. | last2= Milliken | first2= R.E. | last3= Grant | first3= J.A. | last4= McEwen | first4= A.S. | last5= Williams | first5= R.M.E. | last6= Bishop | first6= J.L. | last7= Thomson | first7= B.J. | title= Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter observations of light-toned layered deposits and associated fluvial landforms on the plateaus adjacent to Valles Marineris |journal= Icarus | volume= 205 | issue= 1 |pages= 73–102 | bibcode = 2010Icar..205...73W | year= 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2009.04.017 }}</ref> <!--There are 33 references at this quoted url: <ref name="sciencedirect.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00191035|title=Icarus|publisher=}}</ref> -->  Spirit rover discovered sulfates and goethite in the Columbia Hills.<ref name="agu.org">Christensen, P.R.

[[File:Huygens Crater.jpg|thumb|Huygens Crater with circle showing place where carbonate was discovered. This deposit may represent a time when Mars had abundant liquid water on its surface. Scale bar is 250 km long.]] 
Layered sedimentary deposits are widespread on Mars. These deposits probably consist of both [[sedimentary rock]] and poorly [[hardness|indurated]] or unconsolidated sediments. Thick sedimentary deposits occur in the interior of several canyons in Valles Marineris, within large craters in Arabia and [[Meridiani Planum]] (see [[Henry Crater]] for example), and probably comprise much of the deposits in the northern lowlands (e.g., [[Vastitas Borealis]] Formation).

Fluvial-deltaic deposits are present in [[Eberswalde Crater]] and elsewhere, and photogeologic evidence suggests that many craters and low lying intercrater areas in the southern highlands contain Noachian-aged lake sediments.

While the possibility of [[carbonates on Mars]] has been of great interest to exobiologists and geochemists alike, there was little evidence for significant quantities of carbonate deposits on the surface. In the summer of 2008, the TEGA and WCL experiments on the 2007 [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'']] Mars lander found between 3–5wt% (percent by weight) calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and an alkaline soil.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Boynton | first1=WV | last2=Ming | first2=DW | last3=Kounaves | first3=SP | last4=Young | first4=SM | last5=Arvidson | first5=RE | last6=Hecht | first6=MH | last7=Hoffman | first7=J | last8=Niles | first8=PB | last9=Hamara | first9=DK | last10=Quinn | first10=R.

[[Carbonates]] (calcium or iron carbonates) were discovered in a crater on the rim of Huygens Crater, located in the [[Iapygia quadrangle]]. The impact on the rim exposed material that had been dug up from the impact that created Huygens. These minerals represent evidence that Mars once had a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere with abundant moisture, since these kind of carbonates only form when there is a lot of water. They were found with the [[Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars]] (CRISM) instrument on the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]. Earlier, the instrument had detected clay minerals. The carbonates were found near the clay minerals. Both of these minerals form in wet environments.  It is supposed that billions of years ago Mars was much warmer and wetter. At that time, carbonates would have formed from water and the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. Later the deposits of carbonate would have been buried.  The double impact has now exposed the minerals. Earth has vast carbonate deposits in the form of [[limestone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-071&rn=news.xml&rst=2929|title=News - Some of Mars' Missing Carbon Dioxide May be Buried|work=NASA/JPL}}</ref>

The rocks on the plains of Gusev are a type of [[basalt]].  They contain the [[mineral]]s [[olivine]], [[pyroxene]], [[plagioclase]], and magnetite, and they look like volcanic basalt as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs).<ref>McSween, etal.  2004.  Basaltic Rocks Analyzed by the [[Spirit Rover]] in [[Gusev Crater]].  Science : 305. 842-845</ref><ref name="autogenerated2004">Arvidson, R. E., et al. (2004) Science, 305, 821-824</ref>
Much of the soil on the plains came from the breakdown of the local rocks.  Fairly high levels of [[nickel]] were found in some soils; probably from [[meteorites]].<ref>Gelbert, R., et al.  2006.

Analysis shows that the rocks have been slightly altered by tiny amounts of water.  Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited minerals, maybe [[bromine]] compounds.  All the rocks contain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder rinds of material.  One type can be brushed off, while another needed to be ground off by the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (RAT).<ref>Christensen, P.  Initial Results from the Mini-TES Experiment in Gusev Crater from the Spirit Rover.  Science: 305. 837-842.</ref>

There are a variety of rocks in the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)]], some of which have been altered by water, but not by very much water.

The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet.  All the dust was found to be magnetic.  Moreover, Spirit found the [[magnetism]] was caused by the mineral [[magnetite]], especially magnetite that contained the element [[titanium]].  One magnet was able to completely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic.<ref name="Bertelsen, P. 2004"/>  The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like [[Tharsis]] and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites.  A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces.  Something in it contains a small amount of chemically bound water.<ref name="autogenerated1">Bell, J (ed.)

Observations of rocks on the plains show they contain the minerals pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, and magnetite.  These rocks can be classified in different ways.  The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts—also called picritic basalts.  The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic [[komatiites]].  Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic [[shergottite]]s, meteorites which came from Mars.  One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, [[picrobasalt]], and tephite.  The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts.<ref name="McSween 2004"/>
Plain's rocks have been very slightly altered, probably by thin films of water because they are softer and contain veins of light colored material that may be bromine compounds, as well as coatings or rinds.  It is thought that small amounts of water may have gotten into cracks inducing mineralization processes).<ref name="McSween 2004"/><ref name="autogenerated2004"/>
Coatings on the rocks may have occurred when rocks were buried and interacted with thin films of water and dust.
One sign that they were altered was that it was easier to grind these rocks compared to the same types of rocks found on Earth.

The first rock that Spirit studied was Adirondack.  It turned out to be typical of the other rocks on the plains.

=== Columbia Hills ===
Scientists found a variety of rock types in the Columbia Hills, and they placed them into six different categories.  The six are: Adirondack, Clovis, Wishstone, Peace, Watchtower, Backstay, and Independence.  They are named after a prominent rock in each group.  Their chemical compositions, as measured by APXS, are significantly different from each other.<ref name=Squyres>{{cite journal|last1=Squyres|first1=Steven W.|last2=Arvidson|first2=Raymond E.|last3=Blaney|first3=Diana L.|last4=Clark|first4=Benton C.|last5=Crumpler|first5=Larry|last6=Farrand|first6=William H.|last7=Gorevan|first7=Stephen|last8=Herkenhoff|first8=Kenneth E.|last9=Hurowitz|first9=Joel|last10=Kusack|first10=Alastair|last11=McSween|first11=Harry Y.|last12=Ming|first12=Douglas W.|last13=Morris|first13=Richard V.|last14=Ruff|first14=Steven W.|last15=Wang|first15=Alian|last16=Yen|first16=Albert|title=Rocks of the Columbia Hills|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets|date=February 2006|volume=111|issue=E2|page=E02S11|doi=10.1029/2005JE002562|bibcode=2006JGRE..111.2S11S}}</ref> Most importantly, all of the rocks in Columbia Hills show various degrees of alteration due to aqueous fluids.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ming|first1=D.

They are enriched in the elements phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine—all of which can be carried around in water solutions.  The Columbia Hills' rocks contain basaltic glass, along with varying amounts of olivine and [[sulfate]]s.<ref name=McSween>{{cite journal|last1=McSween|first1=H. Y.|last2=Ruff|first2=S.

The olivine abundance varies inversely with the amount of sulfates.  This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce sulfates.

The Clovis group is especially interesting because the [[Mossbauer spectrometer]] (MB) detected [[goethite]] in it.<ref name="Klingelhofer, G. 2005"/> Goethite forms only in the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills's rocks. In addition, the MB spectra of rocks and outcrops displayed a strong decline in olivine presence,
although the rocks probably once contained much olivine.<ref name=Morris>{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=R. V.|last2=Klingelhöfer|first2=G.|last3=Schröder|first3=C.|last4=Rodionov|first4=D.

Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form.
Wishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and [[anhydrate]] (a sulfate).  Peace rocks showed [[sulfur]] and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected.  Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water.  The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group).  Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.
One type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], and [[iron]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ming | first1 = D. | year = 2006 | title = Geochemical and mineralogical indicators for aqueous processes in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater, Mars | url = | journal = J.

Also, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe<sup>+++</sup> form, which would happen if water had been present.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Towards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure [[silica]] were found in the soil.  The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html |title=NASA - Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref>

After Spirit stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or [[Mini-TES]] and confirmed the presence of large amounts of [[carbonate]]-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water.  The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called "Comanche."<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100603140959.htm |title=Outcrop of long-sought rare rock on Mars found |journal=Science |volume=329 |issue=5990 |pages=421–424 |doi=10.1126/science.1189667 |pmid=20522738 |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2012-01-16|bibcode=2010Sci...329..421M |last1=Morris |first1=R.

In summary, Spirit found evidence of slight weathering on the plains of Gusev, but no evidence that a lake was there.  However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering.  The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates which only form in the presence of water.  It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials.  All the dust contains a magnetic component which was identified as magnetite with some titanium.  Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.

[[Opportunity Rover]] found that the soil at [[Meridiani Planum]] was very similar to the soil at Gusev crater and Ares Vallis; however in many places at Meridiani the soil was covered with round, hard, gray spherules that were named "blueberries."<ref name="Yen, A. 2005">Yen, A., et al.  2005.  An integrated view of the chemistry and mineralogy of martian soils.  Nature.  435.:  49-54.</ref>  These blueberries were found to be composed almost entirely of the mineral [[hematite]].  It was decided that the spectra signal spotted from orbit by Mars Odyssey was produced by these spherules.  After further study it was decided that the blueberries were concretions formed in the ground by water.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>  Over time, these concretions weathered from what was overlying rock, and then became concentrated on the surface as a lag deposit.  The concentration of spherules in bedrock could have produced the observed blueberry covering from the weathering of as little as one meter of rock.<ref name="Squyres, S. 2004">Squyres, S. et al.  2004.

Soils of [[Eagle Crater]] and Meridiani Planum at the Opportunity Rover Landing Site.

The sand may have been transported from somewhere else.<ref>Christensen, P., et al.  Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover.  Science:  306. 1733-1739.</ref>

===Minerals in dust===
A Mossbauer spectrum was made of the dust that gathered on Opportunity's capture magnet.  The results suggested that the magnetic component of the dust was titanomagnetite, rather than just plain [[magnetite]], as was once thought.  A small amount of [[olivine]] was also detected which was interpreted as indicating a long arid period on the planet.  On the other hand, a small amount of hematite that was present meant that there may have been liquid water for a short time in the early history of the planet.<ref>Goetz, W., et al.  2005.  Indication of drier periods on Mars from the chemistry and mineralogy of atmospheric dust.  Nature:  436.62-65.</ref>
Because the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (RAT) found it easy to grind into the bedrocks, it is thought that the rocks are much softer than the rocks at Gusev crater.

===Bedrock minerals===
Few rocks were visible on the surface where Opportunity landed, but bedrock that was exposed in craters was examined by the suite of instruments on the Rover.<ref>Bell, J., et al.  2004.  Pancam Multispectral Imaging Results from the Opportunity Rover at Meridiani Planum.  Science:  306.1703-1708.</ref>  Bedrock rocks were found to be sedimentary rocks with a high concentration of [[sulfur]] in the form of calcium and [[magnesium sulfate]]s.  Some of the sulfates that may be present in bedrocks are [[kieserite]], sulfate anhydrate, bassanite, hexahydrite, [[epsomite]], and [[gypsum]].  [[Salt (chemistry)|Salt]]s, such as [[halite]], bischofite, antarcticite, bloedite, vanthoffite, or gluberite may also be present.<ref>Christensen, P., et al.  2004 Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover.

[[File:PIA15034 Pancam sol2769 L257F.tif|thumb|"Homestake" formation]] 
The rocks contained the sulfates had a light tone compared to isolated rocks and rocks examined by landers/rovers at other locations on Mars.  The spectra of these light toned rocks, containing hydrated sulfates, were similar to spectra taken by the [[Thermal Emission Spectrometer]] on board the [[Mars Global Surveyor]].  The same spectrum is found over a large area, so it is believed that water once appeared over a wide region, not just in the area explored by Opportunity Rover.<ref>Hynek, B.  2004.  Implications for hydrologic processes on Mars from extensive bedrock outcrops throughout Terra Meridiani.  Nature:  431. 156-159.</ref>

The [[Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer]] (APXS) found rather high levels of [[phosphorus]] in the rocks.  Similar high levels were found by other rovers at [[Ares Vallis]] and [[Gusev Crater]], so it has been hypothesized that the mantle of Mars may be phosphorus-rich.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dreibus | first1 = G. | last2 = Wanke | first2 = H. | year = 1987 | title = Volatiles on Earth and Marsw: a comparison | url = | journal = Icarus | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 225–240 | doi=10.1016/0019-1035(87)90148-5 | bibcode=1987Icar...71..225D}}</ref>  The minerals in the rocks could have originated by [[acid]] weathering of [[basalt]].  Because the solubility of phosphorus is related to the solubility of [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[rare earth elements]], they are all also expected to be enriched in rocks.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rieder | first1 = R. | year = 2004 | title = Chemistry of Rocks and Soils at Meridiani Planum from the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer | url = | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5702| pages = 1746–1749 | doi=10.1126/science.1104358| pmid = 15576611 | display-authors = etal |bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1746R }}</ref>

When Opportunity rover traveled to the rim of [[Endeavour crater]], it soon found a white vein that was later identified as being pure gypsum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20111207.html|title=NASA - NASA Mars Rover Finds Mineral Vein Deposited by Water|publisher=}}</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120125093619.htm</ref>  It was formed when water carrying gypsum in solution deposited the mineral in a crack in the rock.  A picture of this vein, called "Homestake" formation, is shown below.

Examination in 2004 of Meridiani rocks, showed the first strong ''in situ'' evidence for past water by detecting the mineral [[jarosite]], which  only forms in water.  This discovery proved that water once existed in [[Meridiani Planum]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Klingelhofer | first1 = G. | year = 2004 | title = Jarosite and Hematite at Meridiani Planum from Opportunity's Mossbauer Spectrometer | url = | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5702| pages = 1740–1745 | doi=10.1126/science.1104653| pmid = 15576610 | display-authors = etal |bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1740K }}</ref>  In addition, some rocks showed small laminations (layers) with shapes that are only made by gently flowing water.<ref name="Herkenhoff, K. 2004">{{cite journal | last1 = Herkenhoff | first1 = K. | year = 2004 | title = Evidence from Opportunity's Microscopic Imager for Water on Meridian Planum | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230854| journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5702| pages = 1727–1730 | doi=10.1126/science.1105286| pmid = 15576607 | display-authors = etal |bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1727H | type = Submitted manuscript }}</ref>  The first such laminations were found in a rock called "The Dells."  Geologists would say that the cross-stratification showed festoon geometry from transport in subaqueous ripples.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  A picture of cross-stratification, also called cross-bedding, is shown on the left.

Box-shaped holes in some rocks were caused by sulfates forming large crystals, and then when the crystals later dissolved, holes, called vugs, were left behind.<ref name="Herkenhoff, K. 2004"/>  The concentration of the element [[bromine]] in rocks was highly variable probably because it is very soluble.  Water may have concentrated it in places before it evaporated.  Another mechanism for concentrating highly soluble bromine compounds is frost deposition at night that would form very thin films of water that would concentrate bromine in certain spots.<ref name="Yen, A. 2005"/>

===Rock from impact===
One rock, "Bounce Rock," found sitting on the sandy plains was found to be ejecta from an impact crater.  Its chemistry was different from the bedrocks.  Containing mostly pyroxene and plagioclase and no olivine, it closely resembled a part, Lithology B, of the shergottite meteorite EETA 79001, a meteorite known to have come from Mars.  Bounce rock received its name by being near an airbag bounce mark.<ref name="Squyres, S. 2004"/>

===Meteorites===
Opportunity Rover found meteorites just sitting on the plains.  The first one analyzed with Opportunity's instruments was called "Heatshield Rock," as it was found near where Opportunity's heatshield landed.  Examination with the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer ([[Mini-TES]]), [[Mossbauer spectrometer]], and APXS lead researchers to, classify it as an [[IAB meteorites|IAB meteorite]].  The APXS determined it was composed of 93% [[iron]] and 7% [[nickel]].  The cobble named "Fig Tree Barberton" is thought to be a stony or stony-iron meteorite (mesosiderite silicate),<ref>Squyres, S., et al.  2009.  Exploration of Victoria Crater by the Mars Rover Opportunity.  Science:  1058-1061.</ref> while "Allan Hills," and "Zhong Shan" may be iron meteorites.

===Geological history===
Observations at the site have led scientists to believe that the area was flooded with water a number of times and was subjected to evaporation and desiccation.<ref name="Squyres, S. 2004"/>  In the process sulfates were deposited.  After sulfates cemented the sediments, hematite concretions grew by precipitation from groundwater.  Some sulfates formed into large crystals which later dissolved to leave vugs.  Several lines of evidence point toward an arid climate in the past billion years or so, but a climate supporting water, at least for a time, in the distant past.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = B. | year = 2005| title = Chemistry and mineralogy of outcrops at Meridiani Planum | url = | journal = Earth Planet.

===Detection of organics===
{{See also|Atmosphere of Mars#Methane}}
On 16 December 2014, NASA reported the ''Curiosity'' rover detected a "tenfold spike", likely localized, in the amount of [[methane]] in the [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]]. Sample measurements taken "a dozen times over 20 months" showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014, averaging "7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere." Before and after that, readings averaged around one-tenth that level.<ref name="NASA-20141216-GW"/><ref name="NYT-20141216-KC"/>

In addition, high levels of [[Organic compound|organic chemicals]], particularly [[chlorobenzene]], were detected in powder drilled from one of the rocks, named "[[List of rocks on Mars|Cumberland]]", analyzed by the Curiosity rover.<ref name="NASA-20141216-GW" /><ref name="NYT-20141216-KC" />
