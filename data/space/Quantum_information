In [[physics]] and [[computer science]], '''quantum information''' is the information of the [[quantum state|state]] of a [[quantum system]]; it is the basic entity of study in '''quantum information theory''', and can be manipulated using [[quantum information processing]] techniques. Quantum information, like classical information, can be processed using [[digital computer]]s, [[communications channel|transmitted]] from one location to another, manipulated with [[algorithm]]s, and analyzed with the computer science [[mathematics]]. While the fundamental unit of classical information is the [[bit]], the most basic unit of quantum information is the [[qubit]]. 

==Quantum information==
Quantum information differs strongly from classical information, epitomized by the [[bit]], in many striking and unfamiliar ways.  Among these are the following:

* A unit of quantum information is the [[qubit]].  Unlike classical digital states (which are discrete), a qubit is continuous-valued, describable by a direction on the [[Bloch sphere]].  Despite being continuously valued in this way, a qubit is the ''smallest'' possible unit of quantum information, as despite the qubit state being continuously-valued, it is [[EPR paradox|impossible]] to [[quantum measurement|measure]] the value precisely.
* A qubit cannot be (wholly) converted into classical bits; that is, it cannot be "read". This is the [[no-teleportation theorem]].
* Despite the awkwardly-named no-teleportation theorem, qubits can be moved from one physical particle to another, by means of [[quantum teleportation]]. That is, qubits can be transported, independently of the underlying physical particle.
* An arbitrary qubit can neither be copied, nor destroyed. This is the content of the [[no cloning theorem]] and the [[no-deleting theorem]].
* Although a single qubit can be transported from place to place (''e.g.'' via quantum teleportation), it cannot be delivered to multiple recipients; this is the [[no-broadcast theorem]], and is essentially implied by the no-cloning theorem.
* Qubits can be changed, by applying [[linear transformation]]s or [[quantum gate]]s to them, to alter their state. While classical gates correspond to the familiar operations of [[Boolean Logic|Boolean logic]], quantum gates are physical [[Unitary operator|unitary operators]] that in the case of qubits correspond to rotations of the [[Bloch sphere]].
* Due to the volatility of quantum systems and the impossibility of copying states, the storing of quantum information is much more difficult than storing classical information. Nevertheless, with the use of [[quantum error correction]] quantum information can still be reliably stored in principle. The existence of quantum error correcting codes has also led to the possibility of [[fault tolerance|fault tolerant]] [[quantum computation]].
* Classical bits can be encoded into and subsequently retrieved from configurations of qubits, through the use of quantum gates.  By itself, a single qubit can convey no more than one bit of accessible classical information about its preparation.  This is [[Holevo's theorem]].  However, in [[superdense coding]] a sender, by acting on one of two [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] qubits, can convey two bits of accessible information about their joint state to a receiver. 
* Quantum information can be moved about, in a [[quantum channel]], analogous to the concept of a classical [[communications channel]]. Quantum messages have a finite size, measured in qubits; quantum channels have a finite [[channel capacity]], measured in qubits per second.
* Quantum information, and changes in quantum information, can be quantitatively measured by using an analogue of [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]] [[information entropy|entropy]], called the [[von Neumann entropy]].  Given a [[statistical ensemble]] of quantum mechanical systems with the [[density matrix]] <math>\rho</math>, it is given by <math> S(\rho) = -\operatorname{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho). \, </math> Many of the same entropy measures in classical [[information theory]] can also be generalized to the quantum case, such as Holevo entropy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mi.ras.ru/~holevo/eindex.html|title=Alexandr S. Holevo|website=Mi.ras.ru|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> and the [[conditional quantum entropy]].
* In some cases [[quantum algorithm]]s can be used to perform computations faster than in any known classical algorithm. The most famous example of this is [[Shor's algorithm]] that can factor numbers in polynomial time, compared to the best classical algorithms that take sub-exponential time. As factorization is an important part of the safety of [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA encryption]], Shor's algorithm sparked the new field of [[post-quantum cryptography]] that tries to find encryption schemes that remain safe even when quantum computers are in play.  Other examples of algorithms that demonstrate [[quantum supremacy]] include [[Grover's algorithm|Grover's search algorithm]], where the quantum algorithm gives a quadratic speed-up over the best possible classical algorithm. The [[complexity class]] of problems efficiently solvable by a [[Quantum Computer|quantum computer]] is known as [[BQP]].
* [[Quantum key distribution]] (QKD) allows unconditionally secure transmission of classical information, unlike classical encryption, which can always be broken in principle, if not in practice.  Do note that certain subtle points regarding the safety of QKD are still hotly debated.

The study of all of the above topics and differences comprises quantum information theory.

==Relation to quantum mechanics==
{{expert needed|1=Physics|2=section|talk=Relation to quantum mechanics|reason=QM does not study|date=December 2018}}
[[Quantum mechanics]] studies how microscopic physical systems change dynamically in nature. In the field of quantum information theory, the quantum systems studied are abstracted away from any real world counterpart. A qubit might for instance physically be a [[photon]] in a [[Linear optical quantum computing|linear optical quantum computer]], an ion in a [[trapped ion quantum computer]], or it might be a large collection of atoms as in a [[Superconducting quantum computing|superconducting quantum computer]]. Regardless of the physical implementation, the limits and features of qubits implied by quantum information theory hold as all these systems are all mathematically described by the same apparatus of [[Density matrix|density matrices]] over the [[complex number]]<nowiki/>s. Another important difference with quantum mechanics is that, while quantum mechanics often studies [[infinite-dimensional]] systems such as a [[Quantum harmonic oscillator|harmonic oscillator]], quantum information theory concerns itself primarily with finite-dimensional systems.
