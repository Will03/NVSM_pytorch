'''World War&nbsp;II''' (often abbreviated to '''WWII''' or '''WW2'''), also known as the '''Second World War''', was a [[World war|global war]] that lasted from 1939 to 1945. [[World War II by country|The vast majority of the world's countries]]—including all the [[great power]]s—eventually formed two opposing [[military alliance]]s: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. A state of [[total war]] emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the [[war effort]], blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the [[List of wars by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in human history, marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]]. It included [[massacre]]s, the [[genocide]] of [[the Holocaust]], [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]], premeditated death from [[starvation]] and disease, and the only use of [[nuclear weapon]]s in war.{{sfn|Gilbert|2001|p=291}}<ref>{{cite book |title=War, Violence, and Population: Making the Body Count |author=James A.

[[Empire of Japan|Japan]], which [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|aimed to dominate]] [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], was [[Second Sino-Japanese War|at war]] with China by 1937,{{sfn|Barrett|Shyu|2001|p=6}}{{efn|Although open hostilities existed between Japan and China from 1937, neither belligerent formally declared war on the other until after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.}} though neither side had [[declaration of war|declared war]] on the other. World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939,<ref>Axelrod, Alan (2007) ''Encyclopedia of World War II, Volume 1''. Infobase Publishing. p. 659.</ref> with the [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and subsequent declarations on Germany by [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of [[military campaign|campaigns]] and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or controlled much of continental [[Europe]], and formed the Axis alliance with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and Japan. Under the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland]], [[Winter War|Finland]], [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Romania]] and the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. Following the onset of campaigns in [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East Africa]], and the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in mid 1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the [[British Empire]]. War in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], the aerial [[Battle of Britain]], the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], and the long [[Battle of the Atlantic]] followed. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched [[Operation Barbarossa|an invasion of the Soviet Union]], opening the largest land theatre of war in history. This [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] trapped the Axis, most crucially the German [[Wehrmacht]], into a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. In December 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|launched a surprise attack]] on the [[United States]] and [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|European colonies]] in the Pacific. Following an immediate U.S. declaration of war against Japan, supported by one from Great Britain, the European Axis powers quickly declared war on the U.S. in solidarity with their Japanese ally. Rapid Japanese conquests over much of the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by many in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories.

The Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical [[Battle of Midway]]; later, Germany and Italy were [[Second Battle of El Alamein|defeated in North Africa]] and then, decisively, at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943, which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasions of Sicily]] and [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], and Allied victories in the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded German-occupied France]], while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in [[Battle of West Hunan|Central China]], [[Second Guangxi Campaign|South China]] and [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], while the Allies crippled the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and captured key Western Pacific islands.

The war in Europe concluded with an [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany]] by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops, the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|suicide of Adolf Hitler]] and the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. Following the [[Potsdam Declaration]] by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] on 6 and 9 August respectively. With an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]] imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]], Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by fiat by the Allies and [[war crimes]] trials were conducted in the wake of the war both [[Nuremberg Trials|against the Germans]] and [[Japanese war crimes#War crimes trials|the Japanese]].

World War&nbsp;II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious [[great power]]s—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]].<ref name="The UN Security Council">{{Citation|title=The UN Security Council|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> The Soviet Union and United States emerged as rival [[superpower]]s, setting the stage for the nearly half-century long [[Cold War]]. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the [[decolonisation of Africa]] and [[Decolonisation of Asia|Asia]]. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[Post–World War II economic expansion|economic recovery and expansion]]. Political integration, especially [[European integration|in Europe]], emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and create a common identity.<ref>{{cite web|title=From War to Peace: A European Tale|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/eu-lecture_en.html|publisher=Nobel Lecture by the European Union|accessdate=4 January 2014|author=Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council|author2=José Manuel Durão Barroso, President of the European Commission|date=10 December 2012}}</ref>

Others follow the British historian [[A.J.P. Taylor]], who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars merged in 1941.

The exact date of the [[End of World War II in Asia|war's end]] is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the [[armistice]] of 14 August 1945 ([[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]), rather than the formal [[surrender of Japan]], which was on 2 September 1945 that officially [[End of World War II in Asia|ended the war in Asia]].

== Background ==
{{Main|Causes of World War II}}

=== Europe ===
[[World War I]] had radically altered the [[Geopolitics|political]] European map, with the defeat of the [[Central Powers]]—including [[Austria-Hungary]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]—and the 1917 [[October Revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power]] in [[Russian Republic|Russia]], which eventually led to the founding of the [[Soviet Union]]. Meanwhile, the victorious [[Allies of World War I]], such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania and Greece, gained territory, and new [[nation-states]] were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09042, Genf, Völkerbund, Sitzungssaal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[League of Nations]] assembly, held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], 1930]]

To prevent a future world war, the [[League of Nations]] was created during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]]. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through [[collective security]], military and [[Washington Naval Treaty|naval disarmament]], and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.

Despite strong [[pacifist]] sentiment [[aftermath of World War I|after World War I]],{{sfn|Ingram|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC&pg=PA76 76–8]}} its aftermath still caused [[irredentist]] and [[revanchist]] [[nationalism]] in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all of [[German colonial empire|its overseas possessions]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [[World War I reparations|reparations]] were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [[Reichswehr|armed forces]].{{sfn|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}

[[File:Nürnberg Reichsparteitag Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] at a German [[National Socialist]] political rally in [[Nuremberg]], August 1933]]

The German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and [[class collaboration]]ist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a [[world power]], promising the creation of a "[[New Roman Empire]]".{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=35}}

[[Adolf Hitler]], after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, eventually [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|became the Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933. He abolished democracy, espousing a [[New Order (Nazism)|radical, racially motivated revision of the world order]], and soon began a massive [[German re-armament|rearmament campaign]].{{sfn|Brody|1999|p=4}} Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, [[Franco-Italian Agreement|allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia]], which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced [[conscription]].{{sfn|Zalampas|1989|p=62}}

The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the [[Stresa Front]] in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards [[military globalization]]; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement|independent naval agreement]] with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe]], drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect though, the [[Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}; {{Harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}.</ref> The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August of the same year.{{sfn|Schmitz|2000|p=124}}

Hitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno treaties]] by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarising the Rhineland]] in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to [[appeasement]].{{sfn|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}} In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome–Berlin Axis]]. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which Italy would join in the following year.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=298–99}}

=== Asia ===
The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in China launched a [[Northern Expedition|unification campaign]] against [[Warlord Era|regional warlords]] and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] against its former [[Chinese Communist Party]] allies{{sfn|Preston|1998|p=104}} and [[Central Plains War|new regional warlords]]. In 1931, an [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|increasingly militaristic]] [[Empire of Japan]], which had long sought influence in China{{sfn|Myers|Peattie|1987|p=458}} as the first step of what its government saw as the country's [[Hakko ichiu|right to rule Asia]], used the [[Mukden Incident]] as a pretext to [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|launch an invasion of Manchuria]] and establish the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].{{sfn|Smith|Steadman|2004|p=28}}

China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being [[Lytton Report|condemned]] for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in [[28 January Incident|Shanghai]], [[Battle of Rehe|Rehe]] and [[Defense of the Great Wall|Hebei]], until the [[Tanggu Truce]] was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933–1936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Coogan|1993}}: "Although some Chinese troops in the Northeast managed to retreat south, others were trapped by the advancing Japanese Army and were faced with the choice of resistance in defiance of orders, or surrender. A few commanders submitted, receiving high office in the puppet government, but others took up arms against the invader. The forces they commanded were the first of the volunteer armies."</ref> After the 1936 [[Xi'an Incident]], the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a [[Second United Front|united front]] to oppose Japan.{{sfn|Busky|2002|p=10}}

[[File:Mussolini truppe Etiopia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benito Mussolini]] inspecting troops during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]], 1935]]

The [[Second Italo–Ethiopian War]] was a brief [[colonial war]] that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (also known as [[Names of Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]) by the armed forces of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (''Regno d'Italia''), which was launched from [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtCL2OYsH6wC |title=Cultural Sociology of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa: An Encyclopedia |author1=Andrea L.

Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, [[Appeasement|but the League did little]] when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's [[Covenant of the League of Nations|Covenant]].{{sfn|Barker|1971|pp=131–32}} The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but they were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=289}} Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]].{{sfn|Kitson|2001|p=231}}

When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist rebels]], led by General [[Francisco Franco]]. The Soviet Union supported the existing government, the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. Over 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the [[International Brigades]], also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this [[proxy war]] as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War II but generally favoured the Axis.{{sfn|Payne|2008|page=271}} His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of [[Blue Division|volunteers]] to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|Payne|2008|page=146}}

In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in [[Manchukuo]] had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]]. The Japanese doctrine of [[Hokushin-ron]], which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkin Gol]] in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=342}} and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of [[Nanshin-ron]], promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.<ref>{{cite web |author=Goldman, Stuart D. |date=28 August 2012 |title=The Forgotten Soviet-Japanese War of 1939 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |publisher=The Diplomat |url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/08/the-forgotten-soviet-japanese-war-of-1939/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Timothy Neeno |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Nomonhan: The Second Russo-Japanese War |publisher=MilitaryHistoryOnline.com |url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/nomonhan.aspx}}</ref>

In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]], again provoking [[Appeasement of Hitler|little response]] from other European powers.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2000|p=144}} Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the [[Sudetenland]], an area of [[Czechoslovakia]] with a predominantly [[ethnic German]] population. Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the counsel of British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and conceded this territory to Germany in the [[Munich Agreement]], which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=121–22}} Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to [[First Vienna Award|cede additional territory]] to [[Hungary]], and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's [[Zaolzie]] region.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=157}}

Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939 [[Plan Z|secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy]] to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia]] and subsequently split it into the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and a pro-German [[client state]], the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]].{{sfn|Davies|2006|loc=pp. 143–44 (2008 ed.)}} Hitler also delivered the 20 March 1939 [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|ultimatum to Lithuania]], forcing the concession of the [[Klaipėda Region]].{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=461-462}}

Immediately after that, Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland, and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/DAP-Poland/Campaign-II.html#chapter5|title=The German Campaign In Poland (1939)|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref>

With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations.

=== War breaks out in the Pacific (1941) ===
{{Main|Pacific War}}

In 1939, the United States had renounced its trade treaty with Japan, and beginning with an [[aviation gasoline]] ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing economic pressure.{{r|ibiblio_1940}} During this time, Japan launched its [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|first attack against Changsha]], a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September.{{sfn|Jowett|Andrew|2002|p=14}} Despite [[1939–40 Winter Offensive|several offensives]] by both sides, the war between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940.

Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale [[1939–40 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] in early 1940. In August, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communists]] launched an [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|offensive in Central China]]; in retaliation, Japan instituted [[Three Alls Policy|harsh measures]] in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists.{{sfn|Joes|2004|p=224}} Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces [[New Fourth Army incident|culminated in armed clashes in January 1941]], effectively ending their co-operation.{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=320}} In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during [[Battle of Shanggao]].{{sfn|Hsu|Chang|1971|p=30}} In September, Japan attempted to [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|take the city of Changsha]] again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.{{sfn|Hsu|Chang|1971|p=33}}

German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European governments in [[Southeast Asia]]. The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan some oil supplies from the [[Dutch East Indies]], but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.<ref>{{cite web |title=Japanese Policy and Strategy 1931 – July 1941 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategy and Command: The First Two Years |pp=45–66 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Strategy/Strategy-2.html}}</ref> In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East.

Since early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.<ref name=USAWWIIcp5>{{cite web |title=The decision for War |website=US Army in WWII – Strategy and Command: The First Two Years |pp=113–27 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Strategy/Strategy-5.html}}</ref> At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them.<ref name=USAWWIIcp4>{{cite web |title=The Showdown With Japan Aug–Dec 1941 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare |pp=63–96 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html}}</ref> Roosevelt reinforced [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946)]] and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any "neighboring countries".{{r|USAWWIIcp4}}

Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American-British-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. On 20 November a new government under [[Hideki Tojo]] presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina.{{r|USAWWIIcp5}} The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/pha/congress/app-d.html#363 The United States Replies].

Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific. The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|p=310}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Dower|1986|p=5}}, calls attention to the fact that "the Allied struggle against Japan exposed the racist underpinnings of the European and American colonial structure. Japan did not invade independent countries in southern Asia. It invaded colonial outposts which the Westerners had dominated for generations, taking absolutely for granted their racial and cultural superiority over their Asian subjects." Dower goes on to note that, before the horrors of Japanese occupation made themselves felt, many Asians responded favourably to the victories of the Imperial Japanese forces.</ref> To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset.{{sfn|Wood|2007|pp=11–12}} On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous [[Japanese expansion (1941–1942)|offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific]].{{sfn|Wohlstetter|1962|pp=341–43}} These included an [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the American fleets at Pearl Harbor]] and [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|the Philippines]], [[Malayan Campaign|landings in Thailand and Malaya]],{{sfn|Wohlstetter|1962|pp=341–43}} and the [[Battle of Hong Kong]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

These attacks led the [[United States declaration of war on Japan|United States]], [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Japan|United Kingdom]], China, Australia and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dunn|1998|p=157}}.

=== Axis advance stalls (1942–43) ===
[[File:Casablanca-Conference.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British PM [[Winston Churchill]] seated at the [[Casablanca Conference]], January 1943]]

On 1 January 1942, the [[Four Policemen|Allied Big Four]]{{sfn|Bosworth|Maiolo|2015|pp=313–14}}—the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the [[Declaration by United Nations]], thereby affirming the [[Atlantic Charter]],{{sfn|Mingst|Karns|2007|p=22}} and agreeing to not to sign a [[separate peace]] with the Axis powers.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=904}}

During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate [[grand strategy]] to pursue. All agreed that [[Europe first|defeating Germany]] was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, [[Operation Sledgehammer|large-scale attack]] on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies.<ref>{{cite web |title=The First Full Dress Debate over Strategic Deployment.

At the [[Casablanca Conference]] in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration, and demanded the [[unconditional surrender]] of their enemies.

By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully conquered [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]], [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]], [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], and [[Rabaul]], inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|pp=247–67, 345}} Despite stubborn [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|resistance]] by Filipino and US forces, the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.{{sfn|Lewis|1953|loc=p. 529 (Table 11)}} On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]] and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=71–74}} Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|South China Sea]], [[Battle of the Java Sea|Java Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean raid (1942)|Indian Ocean]],{{sfn|Grove|1995|p=362}} and [[Bombing of Darwin|bombed the Allied naval base]] at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia.

In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to [[Operation Mo|capture Port Moresby]] by [[amphibious assault]] and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].{{sfn|Maddox|1992|pp=111–12}} Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier [[Doolittle Raid]], was to seize [[Midway Atoll]] and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|occupy the Aleutian Islands]] in Alaska.{{sfn|Salecker|2001|p=186}} In mid-May, Japan started the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]] in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schoppa|2011|p=28}}.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lILltXBTo8oC&pg=PA19 Chevrier & Chomiczewski & Garrigue 2004], p. 19.</ref> In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans, having broken [[Japanese naval codes]] in late May, were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive [[Battle of Midway|victory at Midway]] over the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ropp|2000|p=368}}.</ref>

With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture [[Port Moresby]] by an [[Kokoda Track campaign|overland campaign]] in the [[Territory of Papua]].{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=339}} The Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern [[Solomon Islands]], primarily [[Guadalcanal]], as a first step towards capturing [[Rabaul]], the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Adrian |year=2003 |title=The Encyclopedia of Warfare: From Earliest Times to the Present Day |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=978-1-59228-027-8 |p=259}}</ref>

Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, [[Guadalcanal Campaign|the Battle for Guadalcanal]] took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the [[Oro Province|northern part of the island]], where they faced Australian and United States troops in the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]].{{sfn|Swain|2001|p=197}} Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal.

After the Guadalcanal Campaign, the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific.

In the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany [[Battle of Kursk|attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge]].

On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own [[Operation Kutuzov|counter-offensives]], thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|p=595}} giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|O'Reilly|2001|p=35}}{{sfn|Healy|1992|p=90}} The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified [[Panther–Wotan line]], but the Soviets broke through it at [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Smolensk]] and by the [[Lower Dnieper Offensive]]s.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|pp=50–55}}

In Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|annexed portions of Czechoslovakia]]) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the [[Nazi plunder|sizeable plunder]] of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.<ref>{{Harvnb|Liberman|1996|p=42}}.</ref> Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went on.<ref name="Milward 1979 138">{{Harvnb|Milward|1992|p=138}}.</ref>

In the East, the intended gains of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet [[scorched earth]] policies denied resources to the German invaders.<ref name="Milward 1992 148">{{Harvnb|Milward|1992|p=148}}.</ref> Unlike in the West, the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policy]] encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the "[[Untermensch|inferior people]]" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by [[Generalplan Ost|mass executions]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Barber|Harrison|2006|p=232}}.</ref> Although [[Resistance during World War II|resistance groups]] formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East<ref>{{Harvnb|Hill|2005|p=5}}.</ref> or the West<ref>{{Harvnb|Christofferson|Christofferson|2006|p=156}}</ref> until late 1943.

In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], essentially a Japanese [[hegemony]] which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.<ref>{{Harvnb|Radtke|1997|p=107}}.</ref> Although Japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from European domination in some territories, their excessive brutality turned local public opinion against them within weeks.<ref name="GSWW6_266" /> During Japan's initial conquest it captured {{convert|4000000|oilbbl}} of oil (~5.5×10<sup>5</sup> tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces, and by 1943 was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to {{bbl to t|50|mlt=M}}, 76 per cent of its 1940 output rate.<ref name="GSWW6_266">{{Harvnb|Rahn|2001|p=266}}.</ref>

In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.<ref name="6Econ3">{{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|p=3}}.</ref> In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.<ref name="6Econ3"/>

The United States provided about two-thirds of all the ordnance used by the Allies in terms of warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition.<ref>Mark R. Wilson, ''Destructive Creation: American Business and the Winning of World War II'' (2016) p.2.</ref> Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]].<ref name="6Econ2">{{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|p=2}}.</ref> While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the [[labour force]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Bernstein|1991|p=267}}.</ref> Allied [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffith|first=Charles|title=The Quest: Haywood Hansell and American Strategic Bombing in World War II|isbn=978-1-58566-069-8|publisher=Diane Publishing|year=1999|page=203}}</ref> and Germany's late shift to a [[war economy]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Overy|1994|p=26}}.</ref> contributed significantly.

=== Advances in technology and warfare ===

Aircraft were used for [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]], as [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[bomber]]s, and [[close air support|ground-support]], and each role was advanced considerably. Innovation included [[airlift]] (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);<ref name="EncWWII_76">{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=76}}.</ref> and of [[strategic bombing]] (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).<ref>{{Harvnb|Levine|1992|p=227}}.</ref> [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft weaponry]] also advanced, including defences such as [[radar]] and surface-to-air artillery. The use of the [[jet aircraft]] was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.<ref>{{Harvnb|Klavans|Di Benedetto|Prudom|1997}}; {{Harvnb|Ward|2010|pp=247–51}}.</ref> Although [[Missile|guided missiles]] were being developed, they were not advanced enough to reliably [[Surface-to-air missile|target aircraft]] until some years after the war.

Advances were made in nearly every aspect of [[naval warfare]], most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. Although [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, [[Battle of Taranto|actions at Taranto]], [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.<ref name="EncWWII_163">{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=163}}.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Chris|last2=Chant|first2=Chris|title=Aircraft Carriers: The World's Greatest Naval Vessels and Their Aircraft|page=7|publisher=Silverdale Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1-84509-079-1|location=Wigston, Leics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Chenoweth|first1=H.

[[Land warfare]] changed from the static front lines of [[trench warfare]] of World War&nbsp;I, which had relied on improved [[artillery]] that outmatched the speed of both [[infantry]] and [[cavalry]], to increased mobility and [[combined arms]].
