The '''Society of the Friends of the Constitution''' ({{lang-fr|Société des amis de la Constitution}}), after 1792 renamed '''Society of the Jacobins, Friends of Freedom and Equality''' (''{{lang|fr|Société des Jacobins, amis de la liberté et de l'égalité}}''), commonly known as the '''Jacobin Club''' (''Club des Jacobins'') or simply the '''Jacobins''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|æ|k|ə|b|ɪ|n}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒakɔbɛ̃|lang}}), was the most influential [[Politics|political club]] during the [[French Revolution]].

Initially founded in 1789 by [[Anti-monarchism|anti-royalist]] deputies from [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], the club grew into a nationwide [[Republicanism|republican]] movement, with a membership estimated at a half million or more.<ref name="Brinton1930"/> The Jacobin Club was heterogeneous and included both prominent parliamentary factions of the early 1790s, the [[The Mountain|Mountain]] and the [[Girondins]]. In 1792–1793, the Girondins were more prominent in leading France, the period when [[French Revolutionary Wars|war was declared]] on [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the [[List of French monarchs|monarchy]] was overthrown and the [[French First Republic|Republic]] created. In May 1793, the leaders of the Mountain faction led by [[Maximilien Robespierre]] succeeded in sidelining the Girondin faction and controlled the government until July 1794. Their time in government was characterized by high levels of political violence and for this reason the period of the Jacobin/Mountain government is also commonly referred to as the [[Reign of Terror]]. In October 1793, 21 prominent Girondins were [[guillotine]]d. The Mountain-dominated government executed 17,000 opponents nationwide, purportedly to suppress the [[War in the Vendée|Vendée insurrection]] and the [[Federalist revolts]] and to prevent any other insurrections. In July 1794, the government of Robespierre and allies was pushed out of power—Robespierre and 21 associates were executed. In November 1794, the Jacobin Club was closed.

Today, [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]] are used in a variety of senses. In Britain, where the term Jacobin has been linked primarily to the Mountain, it is sometimes used as a pejorative for [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] revolutionary politics, especially when it exhibits dogmatism and violent repression.<ref name=brown>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Charles Brockden|authorlink=Charles Brockden Brown|editor1-last=Barnard|editor1-first=Philip|editor2-last=Shapiro|editor2-first=Stephen|title=Charles Brockden Brown's Wieland, Ormond, Arthur Mervyn, and Edgar Huntly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6otAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA360|year=2009|origyear=1793–1799|publisher=Hackett Publishing|page=360|isbn=9781624662034|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> In France, Jacobin now generally indicates a supporter of a centralized republican state and strong central government powers<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Rey|editor-first=Alain|editorlink=Alain Rey|title=Dictionnaire historique de la langue française|publisher=[[Dictionnaires Le Robert]]|date=1992|isbn=978-2321000679|language=French}}</ref> and/or supporters of extensive government intervention to transform society.<ref name="Furet2007P243">{{cite book|last1=Furet|first1=François|authorlink=François Furet|last2=Ozouf|first2=Mona|title=Dictionnaire critique de la Révolution française: Idées|date=2007|series=Champs|location=Paris|publisher=Flammarion|page=243|language=French|isbn=978-2081202955}}</ref> It is also used in other related senses, indicating proponents of a state education system which strongly promotes and inculcates civic values and proponents of a strong nation-state capable of resisting any undesirable foreign interference.<ref name="Furet2007P243"/>

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
When the [[Estates General of 1789 in France]] was convened in May–June 1789 at the [[Palace of Versailles]], the club, originated as the ''[[Club Breton]]'', was composed exclusively of a group of [[Brittany|Breton]] representatives attending those Estates General.<ref name=EB1911V15WAP/> They soon were joined by deputies from other regions throughout France. Among early members were the dominating [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|comte de Mirabeau]], Parisian deputy [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Abbé Sieyès]], [[Dauphiné]] deputy [[Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave|Antoine Barnave]], [[Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve|Jérôme Pétion]], the [[Henri Grégoire|Abbé Grégoire]], [[Charles Malo François Lameth|Charles Lameth]],  [[Alexandre-Théodore-Victor, comte de Lameth|Alexandre Lameth]], [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]], the [[Armand, duc d'Aiguillon|duc d'Aiguillon]], and [[Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux|La Revellière-Lépeaux]]. At this time, meetings occurred in secret, and few traces remain concerning what took place or where the meetings were convened.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== Transfer to Paris ===
By [[the March on Versailles]] in October 1789, the club, still entirely composed of deputies, reverted to being a provincial caucus for [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] deputies from Brittany. As of October 1789, the group rented for its meetings the refectory of the [[Couvent des Jacobins de la rue Saint-Honoré|monastery of the Jacobins in the Rue Saint-Honoré]], adjacent to the seat of the Assembly.<ref name=Alpaugh2014>{{cite journal |last=Alpaugh |first=Micah |title=The British Origins of the French Jacobins: Radical Sociability and the Development of Political Club Networks, 1787–1793 |url=http://ehq.sagepub.com/content/44/4/593.abstract |date=Fall 2014 |journal=[[European History Quarterly]] |volume=44 |number=4 |pages=593–619 |doi=10.1177/0265691414546456 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}{{Subscription or libraries}}</ref> The name ''Jacobins'', given in France to the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s (because their first house in Paris was in the Rue Saint-Jacques), was first applied to the club in ridicule by its enemies.

The club was re-founded in November 1789, after an address from the London [[Revolution Society]] congratulating the French on "conquering their liberty" led National Assembly deputies to found their own Société de la Révolution.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} 

=== Growth (1789–1791) ===
[[File:JacobinClubDoor.jpg|thumb|The Jacobin Club was in the Rue Saint-Honoré, Paris]]
Once in Paris, the club soon extended its membership to others besides deputies. All citizens were allowed to enter, and even foreigners were welcomed: the English writer [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]] joined the club in this manner on 18 January 1790. Jacobin Club meetings soon became a place for radical and rousing oratory that pushed for republicanism, widespread education, universal suffrage, separation of church and state, and other reforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldhistory.abc-clio.com |title=World History: The Modern Era  |publisher=Worldhistory.abc-clio.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref> 

On 8 February 1790, the society became formally constituted on this broader basis by the adoption of the rules drawn up by [[Antoine Barnave|Barnave]], which were issued with the signature of the duc d'Aiguillon, the president. The club's objectives were defined as such:
# To discuss in advance questions to be decided by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Assembly]].
# To work for the establishment and strengthening of [[French Constitution of 1791|the constitution]] in accordance with the spirit of the preamble (that is, of respect for legally constituted authority and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]).
# To correspond with other societies of the same kind which should be formed in the realm.

At the same time the rules of order of election were settled, and the constitution of the club determined. There was to be a president, elected every month, four secretaries, a treasurer, and committees elected to superintend elections and presentations, the correspondence, and the administration of the club. Any member who by word or action showed that his principles were contrary to the constitution and the rights of man was to be expelled.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} 

By the 7th article the club decided to admit as associates similar societies in other parts of France and to maintain with them a regular correspondence. By 10 August 1790 there were already one hundred and fifty-two affiliated clubs; the [[History of France#Curtailment of Church powers (Oct. 1789–Dec. 1790)|attempts at counter-revolution]] led to a great increase of their number in the spring of 1791, and by the close of the year the Jacobins had a network of branches all over France. At the peak there were at least 7,000 chapters throughout France, with a membership estimated at a half-million or more.  It was this widespread yet highly centralised organization that gave to the Jacobin Club great power.<ref name=Brinton1930/>

=== Character (1789–1791) ===
[[File:JacobinVignette01.jpg|thumb|upright|Seal of the Jacobin Club from 1789–1792, during the transition from absolutism to constitutional monarchy]]
By early 1791, clubs like the Jacobins, the ''[[Cordeliers|Club des Cordeliers]]'' and the [[Society of the Friends of Truth|''Cercle Social'']] were increasingly dominating French political life. Numbers of men were member of two or more of such clubs. Women were not accepted as members of the Jacobin Club (nor of most other clubs), but they were allowed to follow the discussions from the balconies.  The rather high subscription of the Jacobin Club confined its membership to well-off men. The Jacobins claimed to speak on behalf of the people but were themselves not of 'the people': contemporaries saw the Jacobins as a club of the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref name=Shus-3>{{nl}} Noah Shusterman – ''De Franse Revolutie (The French Revolution).''

Chapter 3 (p. 95–139) : The Civil Constitution of the Clergy (summer 1790–spring 1791).</ref>

As far as the central society in Paris was concerned, it was composed almost entirely of [[profession]]al men (such as the lawyer [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]]) and well-to-do [[bourgeoisie]] (like the brewer [[Antoine Joseph Santerre|Santerre]]). From the start, however, other elements were also present. Besides the teenage son of the [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duc d'Orléans]], [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], a future king of France, liberal aristocrats such as the duc d'Aiguillon, the [[Victor Claude, prince de Broglie|prince de Broglie]], and the [[Louis Marie Antoine, vicomte de Noailles|vicomte de Noailles]], and the bourgeoisie formed the mass of the members. The club further included people like "père" Michel Gérard, a peasant proprietor from Tuel-en-Montgermont, in Brittany, whose rough common sense was admired as the oracle of popular wisdom, and whose countryman's waistcoat and plaited hair were later on to become the model for the Jacobin fashion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} 

The Jacobin Club supported the monarchy up until the very [[History of France#Bloodbath in Paris, Republic established (Sept. 1792)|eve of the republic (20 September 1792)]]. They did not support [[Champ de Mars Massacre#Text of the petition|the petition of 17 July 1791 for the king's dethronement]], but instead published their own petition calling for replacement of king [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]].<ref name=Shus-4>{{nl}} Noah Shusterman – ''De Franse Revolutie (The French Revolution).''

Chapter 4 (p. 141–186): The flight of the king and the decline of the French monarchy (summer 1791–summer 1792).</ref>

The departure of the conservative members of the Jacobin Club to form their own [[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillants Club]] in July 1791 to some extent radicalized the Jacobin Club.<ref name=EB1911V15WAP>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Phillips |first=Walter Alison |author-link=Walter Alison Phillips |editor-last=Chisolm |editor-first=Hugh |editor-link=Hugh Chisholm |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Jacobins, The |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41343/41343-h/41343-h.htm#ar71 |access-date=16 April 2015 |edition=11th |date=1911 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |volume=15 |location=Cambridge |pages= |quote= |ref=}}</ref>

=== Polarization between Robespierrists and Girondins (1791–1792) ===
{{further|History of France#War and internal uprisings (October 1791–August 1792)}}
Late 1791, a group of Jacobins in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] advocated war with Prussia and Austria. Most prominent among them was [[Jacques Pierre Brissot|Brissot]], other members were [[Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud|Pierre Vergniaud]], [[Claude Fauchet (revolutionist)|Fauchet]], [[Maximin Isnard]], [[Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Platière|Jean-Marie Roland]].<ref name=Shus-4/>

[[Maximilien Robespierre]], also a Jacobin, strongly pleaded against war with Prussia and Austria – but in the Jacobin Club, not in the Assembly where he was not seated. 
Disdainfully, Robespierre addressed those Jacobin war promotors as 'the faction from the Gironde'; some, not all of them, were indeed from department [[Gironde]].
The Assembly in April 1792 finally decided for war, thus following the '[[Girondins|Girondin]]' line on it, but Robespierre's place among the Jacobins had now become much more prominent.<ref name=Shus-4/>

From then on, a polarization process started among the members of the Jacobin Club, between a group around Robespierre – after September 1792 called '[[The Mountain|Montagnards]]' or 'Montagne', in English 'the Mountain' – and the Girondins. These groups never had any official status, nor official memberships. The Mountain was not even very homogenous in their political views: what united them was their aversion to the Girondins.<ref name=Shus-6>{{nl}} Noah Shusterman – ''De Franse Revolutie (The French Revolution).''

Chapter 6 (p. 223–269) : The new French republic and its enemies (fall 1792–summer 1793).</ref>

The [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], governing France from October 1791 until September 1792, was dominated by men like Brissot, Isnard and Roland: Girondins. But after June 1792, Girondins visited less and less the Jacobin Club, where Robespierre, their fierce opponent, grew more and more dominant.<ref name=Shus-5>{{nl}} Noah Shusterman – ''De Franse Revolutie (The French Revolution).''

=== Opposition between Montagnards and Girondins in the National Convention (1792–1793) ===
{{further|History of France#Bloodbath in Paris and the Republic established (September 1792)}}
On 21 September 1792, after [[History of France#Bloodbath in Paris and the Republic established (September 1792)|the fall of the monarchy]] the title assumed by the Jacobin Club after the promulgation of the constitution of 1791 (''Société des amis de la constitution séants aux Jacobins à Paris'') was changed to ''Société des Jacobins, amis de la liberté et de l'égalité'' (Society of the Jacobins, Friends of Freedom and Equality).{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} In the newly elected [[National Convention]], governing France as of 21 September 1792, [[Maximilien Robespierre]] made his comeback in the center of French power.<ref name=Shus-5/> Together with his 25-year-old protégé [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]], [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]], [[Georges Danton|Danton]] and other associates they took places on the left side on the highest seats of the session room: therefore that group around and led by Robespierre was called [[The Mountain]] (French: ''la Montagne'', ''les Montagnards''). 

Some historians prefer to identify a parliamentary group around Robespierre as Jacobins,<ref name=brown/><ref name=guard.>{{cite news |last=Shariatmadari |newspaper=the Guardian |first=David |date=27 January 2015 |title=Is it time to stop using the word 'terrorist'? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2015/jan/27/is-it-time-to-stop-using-the-word-terrorist|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref> which can be confusing because not all Montagnards were Jacobin and their primal enemies, the Girondins, were originally also Jacobins. By September 1792, Robespierre indeed had also become the dominant voice in the Jacobin Club.<ref name=Shus-6/>

Since late 1791, the [[Girondins]] became the opponents of Robespierre, but originally also Jacobins who took places on the right side of the session room of the Convention. By now, they stopped visiting the Jacobin Club.<ref name=Shus-6/>

Those parliamentary groups, Montagnards and Girondins, never had any official status, but historians estimate the Girondins in the Convention at 150 men strong, the Montagnards at 120. The remaining 480 of the 750 deputies of the Convention were called 'the Plain' (French: la Plaine) and managed to keep some speed in the debates while Girondins and Montagnards were mainly occupied with nagging the opposite side.<ref name=Shus-6/>

Most Ministries were manned by friends or allies of the Girondins, but while the Girondins were stronger than the Montagnards outside Paris, inside Paris the Montagnards were much more popular, implying that the public galleries of the Convention were always loudly cheering for Montagnards, while jeering at Girondins speaking.<ref name=Shus-6/>

On 6 April 1793, the Convention established the ''[[Committee of Public Safety|Comité de salut public]]'' (Committee of Public Prosperity, also translated as Committee of Public Safety) as sort of executive government of nine, later twelve members, always accountable to the National Convention. Initially, it counted no Girondins and only one or two Montagnards, but gradually the influence of Montagnards in the Committee grew.<ref name=Shus-6/>

=== Girondins disbarred from the National Convention ===
{{see also|History of France#Showdown in the Convention (May–June 1793)|Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793}}
Early April 1793, Minister of War Pache said to the [[National Convention]] that the 22 leaders of the Girondins should be banned. Later that month, the Girondin [[Marguerite-Élie Guadet|Guadet]] accused the Montagnard [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]] of 'preaching plunder and murder' and trying 'to destroy the sovereignty of the people'. A majority of the Convention agreed to put Marat on trial, but the court of justice quickly acquitted Marat. This apparent victory of the Montagnards intensified their antipathies of the Girondins, and more proposals were vented to get rid of the Girondins.<ref name=Shus-6/>

On both 18 and 25 May 1793, the acting president of the Convention, Isnard, a Girondin, warned that the disturbances and disorder on the galleries and around the Convention would finally lead the country to anarchy and civil war, and he threatened on 25 May: "If anything should befall to the representatives of the nation, I declare, in the name of France, that all of Paris will be obliterated". The next day, Robespierre said in the Jacobin Club that the people should "rise up against the corrupted deputies" in the Convention. On 27 May, both Girondins and Montagnards accused the other party of propagating civil war.<ref name=Shus-6/>

On 2 June 1793, the Convention was besieged in its [[Tuileries Palace]] by a crowd of around 80,000 armed soldiers, clamorously on the hand of the Montagnards. In a chaotic session a decree was adopted that day by the Convention, expelling 22 leading Girondins from the Convention, including [[Jean Denis, comte Lanjuinais|Lanjuinais]], Isnard and Fauchet.<ref name=Shus-6/><ref name=bbc,2011>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/robespierre_maximilien.shtml |title=Historic Figures: Maximilien Robespierre (1758–1794) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref>

In late June 1794, three colleagues on the [[Committee of Public Safety|Committee of Public Prosperity/Safety]] – Billaud-Varenne, Collot d'Herbois and Carnot – called Robespierre a dictator. Late July 1794, Robespierre and 21 associates including the Jacobin Saint-Just and the Montagnard Couthon [[9 Thermidor (Fall of Robespierre)|were sentenced to death by the National Convention and guillotined]].<ref name=Shus-8/>

Probably because of the high level of repressive violence – but also to discredit Robespierre and associates as sole responsibles for it{{sfn|Schama|1989|page=851}} – historians have taken up the habit to roughly label the period June 1793–July 1794 as '[[Reign of Terror]]'. 
Later and modern scholars explain that high level of repressive violence with: France was menaced by civil war  and by a coalition of foreign hostile powers, requiring the discipline of the Terror to mold France into a united Republic capable of resisting this double peril.<ref name=Haydon2006>{{cite book |editor1-last=Haydon |editor1-first=Colin |editor2-last=Doyle |editor2-first=William |editor2-link=William Doyle (historian) |title=Robespierre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VM5hh2Ssde0C&pg=PA260&lpg=PA261 |year=2006 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=260–61 |isbn=978-0521026055 |accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>

=== Closure ===
[[File:Clôture de la salle des Jacobins 1794.jpg|thumb|Engraving "Closing of the Jacobin Club, during the night of 27–28 July 1794, or 9–10 Thermidor, year 2 of the Republic"]]
With [[9 Thermidor (Fall of Robespierre)|Robespierre and other leading Montagnards and Jacobins being executed in July 1794]], Montagnards and Girondins as groups seem to have ceased to play a significant role in French history: historians make no more mention of them. Also the Jacobin Club seems not to have played a decisive role any longer.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

On [[9 thermidor]] Year II (27 July 1794), at some time in the evening, [[Louis Legendre]] was sent out to close the Jacobins club which gathered every Saturday evening.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=CMMCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR4&lpg=PR4&dq=reglement+de+la+société+des+amis+de+la+constitution&source=bl&ots=WjeyXFGRv3&sig=FfpaMMcnYBD8jWOS_rd3uR6k6sk&hl=it&sa=X&ei=gxC2T_jMMO_Y4QTmyYilCQ#v=onepage&q=président&f=false Projet de réglement pour la Société des amis de la Constitution: séante aux ...]</ref> The Jacobin club was finally disbanded on 12 November 1794.

=== Reunion of Jacobin adherents (1799) ===
An attempt to reorganize Jacobin adherents was the foundation of the ''Réunion d'amis de l'égalité et de la liberté'', in July 1799, which had its headquarters in the ''[[Salle du Manège]]'' of the [[Tuileries]], and was thus known as the ''Club du Manège''. It was patronized by [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]], and some two hundred and fifty members of [[French Directory|the two councils of the legislature]] were enrolled as members, including many notable ex-Jacobins. It published a newspaper called the ''Journal des Libres'', proclaimed the apotheosis of Robespierre and [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babeuf]], and attacked the [[French Directory|Directory]] as a ''royauté pentarchique''. But public opinion was now preponderatingly moderate or royalist, and the club was violently attacked in the press and in the streets. The suspicions of the government were aroused; it had to change its meeting-place from the Tuileries to the church of the Jacobins (Temple of Peace) in the Rue du Bac, and in August it was suppressed, after barely a month's existence. Its members avenged themselves on the Directory by supporting [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].<ref name="Maximilien Robespierre">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/robespierre-terror.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: Maximilien Robespierre: Justification of the Use of Terror |publisher=Internet Modern History Sourcebook. |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>

== Influence ==
=== Political influence ===
The Jacobin movement encouraged sentiments of patriotism and liberty amongst the populace. The movement's contemporaries, such as the King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], located the effectiveness of the revolutionary movement not "in the force and bayonets of soldiers, guns, cannons and shells but by the marks of political power". {{sfn|Schama|1989|page=279}} Ultimately, the Jacobins were to control several key political bodies, in particular the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and, through it, the National Convention, which was not only a [[legislature]] but also took upon itself [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[judiciary|judicial]] functions. The Jacobins as a political force were seen as "less selfish, more patriotic, and more sympathetic to the Paris Populace."<ref name=Bosher1989>{{cite book |last=Bosher |first=John F. |title=The French Revolution |date=1989 |publisher=W. W. Norton |page=186 |isbn=978-0393959970}}</ref> This gave them a position of charismatic authority that was effective in generating and harnessing public pressure, generating and satisfying ''sans-culotte'' pleas for personal freedom and social progress.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The Jacobin Club developed into a bureau for French [[republicanism]] and revolutionary purity, and abandoned its original ''[[laissez faire]]'' economic views in favor of [[Economic interventionism|interventionism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In power, they completed the [[The Abolition of Feudalism|abolition of feudalism]] that had been formally decided 4 August 1789, but had been held in check by a clause requiring compensation for the abrogation of the [[feudalism|feudal]] privileges.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Maximilien Robespierre entered the political arena at the very beginning of the Revolution, having been elected to represent [[Artois]] at the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates General]]. Robespierre was viewed as the quintessential political force of the Jacobin Movement, thrusting ever deeper the dagger of liberty within the despotism of the Monarchy. As a disciple of Rousseau, Robespierre's political views were rooted in Rousseau's notion of the [[social contract]], which promoted "the rights of man". {{sfn|Schama|1989|page=475}} Robespierre particularly favored the rights of the broader population to eat, for example, over the rights of individual merchants. "I denounce the assassins of the people to you and you respond, 'let them act as they will.' In such a system, all is against society; all favors the grain merchants."  Robespierre famously elaborated this conception in his speech on 2 December 1792: "What is the first goal of society? To maintain the imprescribable rights of man. What is the first of these rights? The right to exist."<ref>"Robespierre," by Mazauric, C., in "Dictionnaire historique de la Revolution francaise," ed. Albert Soboul. Presses Universitaires de France, Paris: 1989.</ref>

The ultimate political vehicle for the Jacobin movement was the Reign of Terror overseen by the Committee of Public Safety, who were given executive powers to purify and unify the Republic.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=JnnXDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT255&lpg=PT255&dq=Society+of+the+Jacobins,+Friends+of+Freedom+and+Equality&source=bl&ots=j5UyA2zt6o&sig=7ZNUyjCoH0PruC_EKCBUHGoiOsU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiFr8CusbHWAhWM5IMKHekLBgQQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&q=Society%20of%20the%20Jacobins,%20Friends%20of%20Freedom%20and%20Equality&f=false|title=Secret Societies: The Complete Guide to Histories, Rites, and Rituals|last=Redfern|first=Nick|date=2017-03-14|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=9781578596461|language=en}}</ref> The Committee instituted [[Eminent domain|requisitioning]], [[rationing]], and [[conscription]] to consolidate new citizen armies. They instituted the Terror as a means of combating those they perceived as enemies within: Robespierre declared, "the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror.".<ref name="Maximilien Robespierre"/>

The meeting place of the [[Fraternal Society of Patriots of Both Sexes]] was an old library room of the convent which hosted the Jacobins, and it was suggested that the Fraternal Society grew out of the regular occupants of a special gallery allotted to women at the Jacobin Club.<ref name=Alger1894>{{cite book|last=Alger|first=John Goldworth|authorlink=John Goldworth Alger|title=Glimpses of the French Revolution: Myths, Ideals, and Realities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUdEAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA144|date=1894|publisher=[[Sampson Low|Sampson Low, Marston & Company]]|page=144|accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref>

=== Cultural influence ===
The cultural influence of the Jacobin movement during the French Revolution revolved around the creation of the Citizen. As commented in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s 1762 book ''The Social Contract'', "Citizenship is the expression of a sublime reciprocity between individual and [[General will]]."{{sfn|Schama|1989|page=354}} This view of citizenship and the General Will, once empowered, could simultaneously embrace the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and adopt the liberal [[French Constitution of 1793]], then immediately suspend that constitution and all ordinary legality and institute [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]s that did not grant a [[presumption of innocence]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter McPhee, ed.|title=A Companion to the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hj9dY-JAzw0C&pg=PA385|date=28 September 2012|publisher=Wiley|page=385}}</ref>

The Jacobins saw themselves as constitutionalists, dedicated to the Rights of Man, and, in particular, to the Declaration's principle of "preservation of the natural rights of liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression" (Article II of the Declaration). The constitution reassured the protection of personal freedom and social progress within French society. The cultural influence of the Jacobin movement was effective in reinforcing these rudiments, developing a milieu for revolution. The Constitution was admired by most Jacobins as the foundation of the emerging republic and of the rise of citizenship.<ref name=Brinton1930P212>{{cite book|last=Brinton|first=Crane|authorlink=Crane Brinton|title=The Jacobins: An Essay in the New History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_ylOcbcAJUC&pg=PA212|date=2011|orig-year=1930|pages=212–213|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|isbn=9781412848107|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref>

The Jacobins were foes of both the Church and of atheism. They set up a new religious cult to replace Catholicism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gottschalk|first=Louis R.|authorlink=Louis R. Gottschalk|title=The Era of the French Revolution (1715–1815)|date=1929|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin Company]]|pages=258–259}}</ref> They advocated deliberate government-organized terror as a substitute for both the rule of law and the more arbitrary terror of mob violence, inheritors of a [[French Revolutionary Wars#War of the First Coalition|war]] that, at the time of their rise to power, threatened the very existence of the Revolution. Once in power the Jacobins completed the overthrow of the [[Ancien Régime]] and successfully defended the Revolution from military defeat. However, to do so, they brought the Revolution to its bloodiest phase, and the one with least regard for just treatment of individuals. They consolidated republicanism in France and contributed greatly to the [[secularism]] and the sense of nationhood that have marked all French republican regimes to this day. However, their ruthless and unjudicial methods discredited the Revolution in the eyes of many. The resulting [[Thermidorian Reaction]] shuttered all of the Jacobin clubs, removed all Jacobins from power, and condemned many, well beyond the ranks of the Mountain, to death or exile.<ref name=Bosher1988>{{cite book|last=Bosher|first=John F.|title=The French Revolution|date=1988|publisher=W.
