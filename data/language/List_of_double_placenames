{{distinguish|List of reduplicated place names}}
'''Double placenames''' prominently feature the [[placename]]s of two or more constituent geopolitical entities.

Such placenames are often created when two cities, provinces or other territories are [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] or merged, and a decision is taken to preserve the old names in [[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]] form rather than invent a new name. This is often out of consideration for local sensitivities, since the smaller entity may resent its takeover, and may demand its symbolic perpetuation within an amalgamated name so as to propagate the impression of a merger between equals.

==Styles==
In their English forms, the conjoined names may have the following patterns:
* concatenation, e.g. [[Papua New Guinea]]
* [[grammatical conjunction]], e.g. [[Trinidad and Tobago]]

The punctuation and capitalization practices in written English vary:
* merging into one word without an intermediate space, e.g. [[Budapest]]
* standing apart, e.g. [[Papua New Guinea]]
* conjunction by [[hyphen]]ation. While English-speakers are relaxed about using a hyphen or not, this punctuation once caused [[Hyphen War|controversy]] between Czechs and Slovaks
* conjunction with an [[en dash]], typically when the usage is associative, attributive or is a juxtaposition of two independent entities.
* [[CamelCase]] may sometimes be attempted, but many style guides recommend against this in formal English-language use.

{{or-section|Is this just about how ''Nordrhein-Westfalen'' is translated misleadingly as "North Rhine-Westphalia" [hyphen] instead of "North Rhine–Westphalia" [endash]? Or is it making broader claims about English- and/or German-language practices?|date=May 2017}}
Three-word names for two-part entities are often ambiguous. For example, it may not be clear whether North Rhine-Westphalia is an amalgamation between the north part of the [[Rhine Province]] on the one hand and [[Westphalia]] on the other (true) or the northern division of some pre-existing place called Rhine-Westphalia (false). While this problem does not arise in German, no entirely satisfactory punctuation of such names has been established in English. In the above case, the hyphen is often omitted because it is misleading. It has been proposed that this state's name be punctuated "North-Rhine/Westphalia" in English, but the solidus or forward slash is also ambiguous.

===Neologisms===
Some names have been merged and modified as an alternative to using [[hyphen]]ation or [[grammatical conjunction]]:
*[[BosWash]]: the [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] extending from [[Boston]] to Washington, D.C., [[CamelCase]] example (extended in fiction into a [[Boston–Atlanta Metropolitan Axis]] or BAMA covering most of the US East Coast)
*[[SeaTac, Washington|SeaTac]]: another example of CamelCase ([[Seattle]] and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]])
*[[Czechoslovakia]]: the [[Czech lands]] and [[Slovakia]]
*[[Senegambia]]: [[Senegal]] and [[Gambia]]
*[[Tanzania]]: [[Tanganyika]] and [[Zanzibar]]

===False double placenames===
[[Binomial nomenclature|Binomial]] placenames are not true double placenames, but elements in a [[hierarchical]] naming system.  They are a means of distinguishing two entities which share a parent geographic feature. Examples:
* [[Guinea-Bissau]] (official name of the country with capital [[Bissau]], as distinct from [[Guinea]], with capital [[Conakry]])
* Congo-[[Brazzaville]] and Congo-[[Kinshasa]] (from the respective capitals of what are officially [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]])

They are often used for railway stations and airports:
* [[King's Cross St Pancras tube station|King's Cross St Pancras]] This is the [[London Underground]] station serving two separate London train terminals, [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] and [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]] train stations.
* [[Paris - Orly Airport]] (one of two Paris airports)
* [[Trenton–Mercer Airport]] (actually located in [[Ewing, New Jersey|Ewing]], outside [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], both in [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]])
Trenton–Mercer is an example of a marketing decision in which a small airport tries to associate itself with a larger city. [[Ryanair]] has been criticized for promoting names for airports unusually far from the city from which they are named, such as [[Paris Beauvais Tillé Airport]] (a triple name) and [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]].

Binomial names may be seen in German-language texts to denominate parts of towns:
* [[Belsen (Bergen)|Bergen-Belsen]] (the Belsen section within the municipality of Bergen: this form is now fixed in English when referring to the Nazi concentration camp and the present memorial there)
* ''Berlin-Charlottenburg'': the district of [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin

The word "and" in its name does not always signify the union of two distinct territories:
*[[Sala y Gómez]]: one island named for two people
*[[Lewis and Clark County, Montana]]: named for [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]]

In [[dual naming]], words in two different languages have been joined by a hyphen or a slash to become the community's (or geographic feature's) official name, often because of [[language politics]]:
*[[Vitoria-Gasteiz]]: the combination of this city's Spanish name of ''Vitoria'' and [[Basque language|Basque]] name of ''Gasteiz''
*[[Dingle/Daingean Uí Chúis]]: proposed official name (combining English and Irish-language names) of a town in the [[County Kerry]] [[Gaeltacht]].
*[[Aoraki / Mount Cook]]: mountain in New Zealand with [[Māori language|Māori]] and English names combined. Many geographic features of New Zealand are officially designated in a similar way (and the country as a whole is sometimes unofficially referred to as "[[Aotearoa]] New Zealand").

Similarly, places may simply have an official name which consists of two names, such as the Australian territory of the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], which consists of the North Keeling Island and the South Keeling Islands.

===Transitional names===
Sometimes names will be concatenated during a name change.  [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] was the name of the former Rhodesia and future Zimbabwe from June 1 to December 12, 1979.
