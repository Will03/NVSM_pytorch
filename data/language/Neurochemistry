'''Neurochemistry''' is the study of [[neurochemical]]s, including [[neurotransmitter]]s and other molecules such as [[Psychoactive drug|psychopharmaceuticals]] and [[neuropeptides]], that influence the function of [[neuron]]s. This field within [[neuroscience]] examines how neurochemicals influence the operation of neurons, [[synapse]]s, and [[neural network]]s. '''Neurochemists''' analyze the [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]] of [[organic compound]]s in the nervous system, and their roles in such neural processes as [[cortical plasticity]], [[neurogenesis]], and [[Neural development|neural differentiation]].

==History==
In the 1950s, neurochemistry became a recognized scientific research discipline.<ref>{{Cite book|title = History of Neurochemistry|last = Agranoff|first = Bernard W.|date = 22 July 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of Life Sciences|doi = 10.1038/npg.els.0003465|pmid = |isbn = 978-0470016176}}</ref> The founding of neurochemistry as a discipline traces it origins to a series of "International Neurochemical Symposia", of which the first symposium volume published in 1954 was titled ''Biochemistry of the Developing Nervous System''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Siegel | first = George J.  |author2=Albers, R.W. |author3=Brady, S.T. |author4=Price, D.L.  | title = Basic Neurochemistry, 7th Ed. | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-12-088397-4}}</ref> These meetings led to the formation of the [[International Society for Neurochemistry]] and the [[American Society for Neurochemistry]]. These early gatherings discussed the tentative nature of possible neurotransmitter substances such as [[acetylcholine]], [[histamine]], [[substance P]], and [[serotonin]]. By 1972, ideas were more concrete. Neurochemicals such as [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]] were classified as "putative neurotransmitters in certain neuronal tracts in the brain."
