{{Short description|Form of translation attempting to preserve sound rather than meaning}}{{Translation sidebar}}
'''Homophonic translation''' renders a text in one language into a near-[[homophones|homophonic]] text in another language, usually with no attempt to preserve the original meaning of the text.  In one homophonic translation, for example, the English "sat on a wall" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|t|ɒ|n|ə|ˈ|w|ɔː|l}} is rendered as French ''"s'étonne aux Halles"'' {{IPA-fr|setɔnoɑl|}} (literally "is surprised at the Market"). More generally, '''homophonic transformation''' renders a text into a near-homophonic text in the same or another language: ''e.g.,'' "recognize speech" could become "wreck a nice beach".

Homophonic translation may be used to render proper nouns in a foreign language. A more elegant solution, when possible, is [[phono-semantic matching]], which attempts to have closer semantics as well as the proper sound.

Alternatively, homophonic translation may be used for humorous purpose, as [[bilingual pun]]ning ([[macaronic language]]). This requires the listener or reader to understand both the surface, nonsensical translated text, as well as the [[source text]]—the surface text then sounds like source text spoken in a foreign accent.

== Examples ==

Frayer Jerker is a homophonic translation of the French [[Frère Jacques]] (1956).<ref>{{cite book |last1= Chace |first1= Howard L. |authorlink1= Howard L.

Examples of homophonic transformation include [[Howard L. Chace]]'s "[[Ladle Rat Rotten Hut]]", written in "Anguish Languish" (English Language) and published in book form in 1956.

Other names proposed for this genre include "allographic translation",<ref>Bernard Dupriez, ''A Dictionary of Literary Devices: Gradus, A-Z'', Toronto 1991. {{ISBN|0-8020-6803-0}}. p. 462.</ref> "transphonation", or (in French) "''traducson''",<ref name=genette>''cf.'' {{cite book |title=Palimpsests |first1=Gérard |last1=Genette |author-link=Gérard Genette |first2=Channa |last2=Newman |first3=Claude |last3=Doubinsky |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KbYzNp94C9oC&pg=PA40 40–41] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbYzNp94C9oC}}</ref> but none of these is widely used.

The individual words are almost all correct French (with the exceptions that ''fallent'' is a form of the non-existent verb *''faller'' and ''Reguennes'' is a [[hapax legomenon]]), and some passages follow standard syntax and are interpretable (though nonsensical), but the result is in fact not meaningful French.
