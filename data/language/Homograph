{{Wiktionary|homograph}}

A '''homograph''' (from the {{lang-el|ὁμός}}, ''homós'', "same" and γράφω, ''gráphō'', "write") is a [[word]] that shares the same written form as another word but has a different meaning.<ref>
{{
	cite web|
	title=One of two or more words that have the same spelling but differ in origin, meaning, and sometimes pronunciation, such as fair (pleasing in appearance) and fair (market) or wind (wĭnd) and wind (wīnd)|

	}}
	</ref> However, some dictionaries insist that the words must also sound different,<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vCUTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&dq=homograph+dictionary&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMI2J_XwvfhxgIVji3bCh3O0wBB#v=onepage&q=homograph%20dictionary&f=false ''Homophones and Homographs: An American Dictionary, 4th ed.''], McFarland, 2006, p. 3.</ref> while the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] says that the words should also be of "different origin".<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: ''homograph''.</ref> In this vein, ''The Oxford Guide to Practical Lexicography'' lists various types of homographs, including those in which the words are discriminated by being in a different ''word class'', such as ''hit'', the verb ''to strike'', and ''hit'' the noun ''a blow''.<ref>Atkins, BTS.; Rundell, M., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H0rc_cnr3NYC&pg=PA192&dq=homograph+dictionary&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBWoVChMI2J_XwvfhxgIVji3bCh3O0wBB#v=onepage&q=homograph%20dictionary&f=false ''The Oxford Guide to Practical Lexicography''], OUP Oxford, 2008, 
pp. 192 - 193.</ref>

If, when spoken, the meanings may be distinguished by different pronunciations, the words are also [[heteronym (linguistics)|heteronym]]s. Words with the same writing ''and'' pronunciation (i.e. are both homographs and [[homophone]]s) are considered [[homonym]]s. However, in a looser sense the term "homonym" may be applied to words with the same writing ''or'' pronunciation. Homograph disambiguation is critically important in [[speech synthesis]], [[natural language processing]] and other fields. Identically written different senses of what is judged to be fundamentally the ''same'' word are called [[polyseme]]s; for example, ''wood'' (substance) and ''wood'' (area covered with trees).

==In English==
Examples:
*''sow'' (verb) – to plant seed
:''sow'' (noun) – female pig
where the two words are spelt identically but pronounced differently. Here confusion is not possible in spoken language but could occur in written language.

*''bear'' (verb) – to support or carry
:''bear'' (noun) –  the animal
where the words are identical in spelling and pronunciation, but differ in meaning and grammatical function. These are called [[Homonym|homonyms]].

==In Chinese==
Many Chinese [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] have homographs, called {{Linktext|多音字}} ({{zh|p=duōyīnzì}}) or {{Linktext|重形字}} ({{zh|p=chóngxíngzì}}), {{Linktext|破音字}} ({{zh|p=pòyīnzì}}).

===Old Chinese===
Modern study of [[Old Chinese]] has found patterns that suggest a system of [[affix]]es.<ref>{{cite book |title=Chinese|last=Norman|first=Jerry|authorlink=Jerry Norman (sinologist)|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-22809-1|page=84}}</ref> One pattern is the addition of the [[prefix]] {{IPA|/*ɦ/}}, which turns [[transitive verbs]] into [[intransitive verb|intransitive]] or [[passive voice|passives]] in some cases:<ref name=baxterhandbook>{{cite book |title=A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology (Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs)|last=Baxter|first=William H.|year=1992|publisher=de Gruyter Mouton|location=Berlin and New York|isbn=978-3-11-012324-1|pages=218–220}}</ref>

Another pattern is the use of a {{IPA|/*s/}} [[suffix]], which seems to create nouns from verbs or verbs from nouns:<ref name=baxterhandbook/>

===Middle Chinese===
Many homographs in Old Chinese also exist in [[Middle Chinese]]. Examples of homographs in Middle Chinese are:

===Modern Chinese===
Many homographs in Old Chinese and Middle Chinese also exist in modern Chinese varieties. Homographs which did not exist in Old Chinese or Middle Chinese often come into existence due to differences between [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]]. Other homographs may have been created due to merging two different characters into the same glyph during script reform (See [[Simplified Chinese characters]] and [[Shinjitai]]).

Some examples of homographs in [[Cantonese]] from Middle Chinese are:

|-
! Word !! Pronunciation<sub>a</sub> !! Meaning<sub>a</sub> !! Pronunciation<sub>b</sub> !! Meaning<sub>b</sub>
|-
| 易 || {{IPA|[jiː˨]}} || easy || {{IPA|[jɪk˨]}} || (v.) change
