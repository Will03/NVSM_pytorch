{{Global surveillance}}

'''Global surveillance''' refers to the [[mass surveillance]] of entire populations across national borders.<ref>{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Maureen|title=Illusions of Security: Global Surveillance and Democracy in the Post-9/11 World|year=2007|publisher=[[City Lights Books]]|location=San Francisco|isbn=0872864766|edition=1st}}</ref> Its roots can be traced back to the middle of the 20th century when the [[UKUSA Agreement]] was jointly enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States, which later expanded to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to create the present [[Five Eyes]] alliance. The alliance developed cooperation arrangements with several "third-party" nations. Eventually, this resulted in the establishment of a global surveillance network, code-named "[[ECHELON]]" (1971).<ref name="auto">{{cite news|title=Q&A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 May 2001}}</ref><ref name="Nabbali 2004 84–97">{{cite journal|last=Nabbali|first=Talitha|author2=Perry, Mark|title=Going for the throat|journal=Computer Law & Security Review|date=March 2004|volume=20|issue=2|pages=84–97|doi=10.1016/S0267-3649(04)00018-4|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364904000184|quote=It wasn't until 1971 that the UKUSA allies began ECHELON}}</ref>

== Historical background ==

{{Main|Origins of global surveillance}}

The [[origins of global surveillance]] can be traced back to the late 1940s after the [[UKUSA Agreement]] was collaboratively enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States, which eventually culminated in the creation of the global surveillance network code-named "'''[[ECHELON]]'''" in 1971.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="Nabbali 2004 84–97"/>

In the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal|1970s Watergate affair]] and a subsequent [[congressional inquiry]] led by Sen. [[Frank Church]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/preemption/telecoms.html|title=Pre-Emption - The Nsa And The Telecoms - Spying On The Home Front - FRONTLINE - PBS|work=pbs.org|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref> it was revealed that the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], in collaboration with Britain's GCHQ, had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti-[[Vietnam War]] leaders such as [[Jane Fonda]] and Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Martin |title=No Holiday |url= |location=New York |publisher=Disinformation Company Ltd |isbn=978-1-932857-29-0 }}</ref> Decades later, a multi-year investigation by the [[European Parliament]] highlighted the NSA's role in [[Industrial espionage|economic espionage]] in a report entitled 'Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information', in 1999.<ref>{{Cite report |author=Peggy Becker |date=October 1999 |title=DEVELOPMENT OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY AND RISK OF ABUSE OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION |url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/development-of-surveillance-technology-and-risk-of-abuse-of-economic-information-pbQASTOA132/downloads/QA-ST-OA-132-EN-N/QASTOA132ENN_002.pdf;pgid=y8dIS7GUWMdSR0EAlMEUUsWb00002lUIfz2M;sid=w3lJEyGE1rNJH3CegDfXtEOhYbo1Q2zn3Qs=?FileName=QASTOA132ENN_002.pdf&SKU=QASTOA132ENN_PDF&CatalogueNumber=QA-ST-OA-132-EN-N |publisher=STOA, European Parliament |page= |docket= |accessdate=31 January 2014 |quote= }}</ref>

However, for the general public, it was a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents in June 2013 that first revealed the massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic. Most of these were leaked by an ex-contractor, [[Edward Snowden]]. Even so, a number of these older global surveillance programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[XKeyscore]], and [[Tempora]] were referenced in the 2013 release of thousands of documents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/07/15/snowden-has-thousands-of-damaging-nsa-documents-says-greenwald/|title=Snowden has 'thousands' of damaging NSA documents, says Greenwald|work=MSNBC|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref> Many countries around the world, including [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] and member states of [[NATO]], have been targeted by the "[[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]]" strategic alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA—five English-speaking [[Western world|Western countries]] aiming to achieve [[Total Information Awareness]] by [[mastering the Internet]] with analytical tools such as the [[Boundless Informant]].<ref name="guardian1">{{cite news|author1=Glenn Greenwald |author2=Ewen MacAskill |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-boundless-informant-global-datamining |title=Boundless Informant: the NSA's secret tool to track global surveillance data |work=The Guardian |accessdate=12 June 2013 |location=London |date=8 June 2013}}</ref> As confirmed by the NSA's director [[Keith B.

On 6 June 2013, Britain's ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper began publishing a series of revelations by an as yet unknown American whistleblower, revealed several days later to be ex-CIA and ex-NSA-contracted systems analyst Edward Snowden. Snowden gave a cache of documents to two journalists: [[Glenn Greenwald]] and [[Laura Poitras]], Greenwald later estimated that the cache contains 15,000 – 20,000 documents, some very large and very detailed, and some very small.<ref name=cepr1>{{cite news|url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/the-americas-blog/greenwald-testifies-to-brazilian-senate-about-nsa-espionage-targeting-brazil-and-latin-america|title=Greenwald Testifies to Brazilian Senate about NSA Espionage Targeting Brazil and Latin America |author =Duran-Sanchez, Mabel|date=10 August 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref><ref name =Senado1>{{cite web|url=http://www.senado.gov.br/noticias/TV/default.asp?IND_ACESSO=S&cod_midia=269827&cod_video=267526|title=Glenn Greenwald afirma que documentos dizem respeito à interesses comerciais do governo americano|date=6 August 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref> In over two subsequent months of publications, it became clear that the NSA had operated a complex web of spying programs which allowed it to intercept Internet and telephone conversations from over a billion users from dozens of countries around the world. Specific revelations were made about China, the European Union, Latin America, Iran and Pakistan, and Australia and New Zealand, however, the published documentation reveals that many of the programs indiscriminately collected bulk information directly from central servers and Internet backbones, which almost invariably carry and reroute information from distant countries.

Due to this central server and backbone monitoring, many of the programs overlapped and interrelated among one another. These programs were often carried out with the assistance of US entities such as the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the [[FBI]],<ref name="microsoft">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data How Microsoft handed the NSA access to encrypted messages], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 12 July 2013. Retrieved 13 July 2013.</ref> was sanctioned by US laws such as the [[FISA Amendments Act]], and the necessary court orders for them were signed by the secret [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]]. Some of the NSA's programs were directly aided by national and foreign intelligence agencies, Britain's [[GCHQ]] and Australia's [[Defence Signals Directorate|DSD]], as well as by large private telecommunications and Internet corporations, such as [[Verizon]], [[Telstra]],<ref>{{cite news|author=Bridie Jabour in Sydney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/12/telstra-deal-america-government-spying |title=Telstra signed deal that would have allowed US spying |work=The Guardian |date=12 July 2013 |location=London}}</ref> [[Google]] and Facebook.<ref>The first three days of revelations were: the FISC court order that Verizon provide bulk metadata to its customers to the NSA; presentation slides explaining the cooperation of nine US internet giants through the PRISM program; and the bulk collection of Chinese users' text messages, which coincided with [[Xi Jinping]]'s visit to California to meet [[Barack Obama]].</ref>

Snowden's disclosures of the NSA's surveillance activities are a continuation of [[news leak]]s which have been ongoing since the early 2000s. One year after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], former U.S. intelligence official [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], was publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Shorrock |first= Tim |authorlink= Tim Shorrock |title= The Untold Story: Obama's Crackdown on Whistleblowers: The NSA Four reveal how a toxic mix of cronyism and fraud blinded the agency before 9/11 |journal= The Nation |date= 15 April 2013 |url= http://www.thenation.com/article/173521/obamas-crackdown-whistleblowers }}</ref>

Further disclosures followed. On 16 December 2005, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report under the headline "[[George W.

The newspaper released a report on 11 May 2006, regarding the NSA's "massive database" of phone records collected from "tens of millions" of U.S. citizens. According to ''USA Today'', these phone records were provided by several telecom companies such as [[AT&T]], [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] and [[BellSouth]].<ref name="USATODAY1">{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm|title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls|last=Leslie Cauley|first=|work=|access-date=|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|date=11 May 2006}}</ref> In 2008, the security analyst [[Babak Pasdar]] revealed the existence of the so-called "Quantico circuit" that he and his team discovered in 2003 when brought on to update the carrier's security system.

In an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' published on 12 August 2013, former NSA Director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] admitted that "We (the NSA) steal secrets. We're number one in it". Hayden also added: "We steal stuff to make you safe, not to make you rich".<ref name="spiegellaurapoitras"/>

According to documents seen by the news agency [[Reuters]], these "secrets" were subsequently funnelled to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.<ref name="reuters3">{{cite news|title=Exclusive: U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805|agency=Reuters|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=5 August 2013}}</ref> Federal agents are then instructed to "recreate" the investigative trail in order to "cover up" where the information originated.<ref name="reuters3" />

=== Contact chaining ===

[[File:NSA Syanpse Data Model.png|500px|right|thumb|''[[The New York Times]]'', citing documents leaked by Snowden, reported in September 2013 on the NSA's "push to exploit phone and e-mail data of Americans after it lifted restrictions in 2010", which enables "large-scale graph analysis on very large sets of communications metadata".<ref>{{cite news|title=Documents on N.S.A.

According to The ''Times'', the NSA can "augment the communications data with material from public, commercial and other sources, including [[bank code]]s, [[insurance]] information, [[Facebook]] profiles, [[Manifest (transportation)|passenger manifests]], [[Voter database|voter registration rolls]] and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location information, as well as [[property]] records and unspecified [[tax]] data".<ref name="nsasocial"/> Such types of data were collected from U.S. citizens as well as foreign nationals.<ref name="nsasocial"/>]]

The NSA uses the analysis of phone call and e-mail logs of American citizens to create sophisticated graphs of their social connections that can identify their associates, their locations at certain times, their travelling companions and other personal information.<ref name="nsasocial">{{cite news|title=N.S.A.

According to [[top secret]] NSA documents leaked by Snowden, during a single day in 2012, the NSA collected [[e-mail]] [[address book]]s from:

* 22,881 [[Gmail]] accounts<ref name="wapo1">{{cite news|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani |title=NSA collects millions of e-mail address books globally|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-address-books-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=20 December 2013|date=1 November 2013}}</ref>

* 105,068 [[Outlook.com|Hotmail]] accounts<ref name="wapo1"/>
* 444,743 [[Yahoo!]] accounts<ref name="wapo1"/>

Each day, the NSA collects contacts from an estimated 500,000 [[Contact list|buddy lists]] on live-chat services as well as from the inbox displays of Web-based e-mail accounts.<ref name="wapo1"/> Taken together, the data enables the NSA to draw detailed maps of a person's life based on their personal, professional, religious and political connections.<ref name="wapo1"/>

=== Data transfer ===

Federal agencies in the United States:  Data gathered by these surveillance programs is routinely shared with the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).<ref name=microsoftencrypt>{{cite web|author1=Glenn Greenwald |author2=Ewen MacAskill |author3=Laura Poitras |author4=Spencer Ackerman |author5=Dominic Rushe |title=Microsoft handed the NSA access to encrypted messages|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=22 December 2013}}</ref> In addition, the NSA supplies domestic intercepts to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), and other law enforcement agencies.<ref name="reuters3" />

Foreign countries: As a result of the NSA's [[secret treaty|secret treaties]] with foreign countries, data gathered by its surveillance programs are routinely shared with countries who are signatories to the [[UKUSA Agreement]]. These foreign countries also help to operate several NSA programs such as '''[[XKeyscore|XKEYSCORE]]'''. (See [[Global surveillance#International cooperation|International cooperation]].)

=== Financial payments monitoring ===

A special branch of the NSA called "'''Follow the Money'''" (FTM) monitors international payments, banking and credit card transactions and later stores the collected data in the NSA's financial databank, "'''Tracfin'''".<ref name="nsafin">{{cite web|title='Follow the Money': NSA Spies on International Payments|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/spiegel-exclusive-nsa-spies-on-international-bank-transactions-a-922276.html|publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]''|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

=== Mobile phone location tracking ===

[[Mobile phone tracking]] refers to the act of attaining the position and coordinates of a mobile phone. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the NSA has been tracking the locations of mobile phones from all over the world by tapping into the cables that connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as well as foreign ones. In the process of doing so, the NSA collects more than 5 billion records of phone locations on a daily basis. This enables NSA analysts to map cellphone owners' relationships by correlating their patterns of movement over time with thousands or millions of other phone users who cross their paths.<ref name=wapo52013>{{cite news|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani |title=NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations-worldwide-snowden-documents-show/2013/12/04/5492873a-5cf2-11e3-bc56-c6ca94801fac_story.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA is tracking people right now|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/how-the-nsa-is-tracking-people-right-now/634/|accessdate=6 December 2013|date=4 December 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=FASCIA: The NSA's huge trove of location records|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/what-is-fascia/637/|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 December 2013|author1=Ashkan Soltani |author2=Matt DeLong }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA uses cellphone tracking to find and 'develop' targets|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/national/how-the-nsa-uses-cellphone-tracking-to-find-and-develop-targets/2013/12/04/d9114d52-5d1f-11e3-95c2-13623eb2b0e1_video.html|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Reporter explains NSA collection of cellphone data|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/politics/reporter-explains-nsa-collection-of-cellphone-data/2013/12/04/67b85252-5d26-11e3-95c2-13623eb2b0e1_video.html|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|title=The NSA says it 'obviously' can track locations without a warrant.

In order to decode private conversations, the NSA has cracked the most commonly used cellphone encryption technology, [[A5/1]]. According to a classified document leaked by Snowden, the agency can "process encrypted A5/1" even when it has not acquired an encryption key.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Craig Timberg |author2=Ashkan Soltani |title=By cracking cellphone code, NSA has capacity for decoding private conversations|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/by-cracking-cellphone-code-nsa-has-capacity-for-decoding-private-conversations/2013/12/13/e119b598-612f-11e3-bf45-61f69f54fc5f_story.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref> In addition, the NSA uses various types of cellphone infrastructure, such as the links between carrier networks, to determine the location of a cellphone user tracked by [[Visitor Location Registers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA pinpoints a mobile device|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/how-the-nsa-pinpoints-a-mobile-device/645/#document/p2/a135576|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref>

=== Infiltration of smartphones ===

As worldwide sales of [[smartphone]]s grew rapidly, the NSA decided to take advantage of the smartphone boom. This is particularly advantageous because the smartphone contains a variety of data sets that would interest an intelligence agency, such as social contacts, user behaviour, interests, location, photos and [[credit card]] numbers and passwords.<ref name="spiegel201399"/>

According to the documents leaked by Snowden, the NSA has set up [[task force]]s assigned to several smartphone manufacturers and [[operating systems]], including [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPhone]] and [[iOS]] operating system, as well as [[Google]]'s [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile operating system.<ref name="spiegel201399"/> Similarly, Britain's [[GCHQ]] assigned a team to study and crack the [[BlackBerry]].<ref name="spiegel201399"/> In addition, there are smaller NSA programs, known as "scripts", that can perform surveillance on 38 different features of the [[iOS 3]] and [[iOS 4]] operating systems. These include the [[map]]ping feature, [[voicemail]] and photos, as well as [[Google Earth]], [[Facebook]] and [[Yahoo! Messenger]].<ref name="spiegel201399">{{cite web|author1=Laura Poitras |author2=Marcel Rosenbach |author3=Holger Stark |title=iSpy: How the NSA Accesses Smartphone Data|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/how-the-nsa-spies-on-smartphones-including-the-blackberry-a-921161.html|publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]''|accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref>

=== Infiltration of commercial data centers ===

In contrast to the '''[[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]]''' surveillance program, which is a front-door method of access that is nominally approved by the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISA court]], the '''[[Muscular (surveillance program)|MUSCULAR]]''' surveillance program is noted to be "unusually aggressive" in its usage of unorthodox hacking methods to infiltrate Yahoo! and Google [[data centre]]s around the world. As the program is operated overseas ([[United Kingdom]]), the NSA presumes that anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner, and is, therefore, able to collect content and metadata on a previously unknown scale from U.S. citizens and residents.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html|title=NSA infiltrates links to Yahoo, Google data centers worldwide, Snowden documents say|first1=Barton|last1=Gellman|first2=Ashkan|last2=Soltani|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=30 October 2013|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> According to the documents leaked by Snowden, the MUSCULAR surveillance program is jointly operated by the NSA and Britain's [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] agency.<ref name="How we know">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/04/how-we-know-the-nsa-had-access-to-internal-google-and-yahoo-cloud-data/|title=How we know the NSA had access to internal Google and Yahoo cloud data|first1=Barton|last1=Gellman|first2=Ashkan|last2=Soltani|first3=Andrea|last3=Peterson|work=The Washington Post|date=4 November 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref> (See [[Global surveillance#International cooperation|International cooperation]].)

=== Infiltration of anonymous networks ===

The [[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]] have made repeated attempts to spy on Internet users communicating in secret via the anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]. Several of their clandestine operations involve the implantation of malicious code into the computers of anonymous Tor users who visit infected websites. In some cases, the NSA and GCHQ have succeeded in blocking access to the anonymous network, diverting Tor users to insecure channels. In other cases, the NSA and the GCHQ were able to uncover the identity of these anonymous users.<ref>{{cite news|title=Secret NSA documents show campaign against Tor encrypted network|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secret-nsa-documents-show-campaign-against-tor-encrypted-network/2013/10/04/610f08b6-2d05-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Craig Timberg |author3=Steven Rich }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NSA slideshow on 'The TOR problem'|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-slideshow-on-the-tor-problem/499/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013|author1=Steven Rich |author2=Matt DeLong }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Timothy B.|title=Everything you need to know about the NSA and Tor in one FAQ|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-nsa-and-tor-in-one-faq/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NSA report on the Tor encrypted network|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-research-report-on-the-tor-encryption-program/501/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=GCHQ report on 'MULLENIZE' program to 'stain' anonymous electronic traffic|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/gchq-report-on-mullenize-program-to-stain-anonymous-electronic-traffic/502/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NSA and GCHQ target Tor network that protects anonymity of web users|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013|author1=James Ball |author2=Bruce Schneier |author3=Glenn Greenwald }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|title=Attacking Tor: how the NSA targets users' online anonymity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Tor Stinks' presentation – read the full document|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-stinks-nsa-presentation-document|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tor: 'The king of high-secure, low-latency anonymity'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-high-secure-internet-anonymity|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}</ref>

=== Monitoring of hotel reservation systems ===

Under the '''[[Royal Concierge]]''' surveillance program, Britain's GCHQ agency uses an automated monitoring system to infiltrate the [[hotel reservation system|reservation system]]s of at least 350 luxury [[hotel]]s in many different parts of the world.<ref name="spirgelconcierge">{{cite web|author1=Laura Poitras |author2=Marcel Rosenbach |author3=Holger Stark |title='Royal Concierge': GCHQ Monitors Hotel Reservations to Track Diplomats|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/gchq-monitors-hotel-reservations-to-track-diplomats-a-933914.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=17 November 2013|date=17 November 2013}}</ref> Other related surveillance programs involve the wiretapping of room telephones and fax machines used in targeted hotels, as well as the monitoring of computers, hooked up to the hotel network.<ref name="spirgelconcierge"/>

=== [[Virtual reality]] surveillance ===

The U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), and Britain's [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) have been conducting surveillance on the networks of many online games, including [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs) such as [[World of Warcraft]], as well as [[virtual world]]s such as [[Second Life]], and the [[Xbox]] gaming console.<ref>{{cite news|author1=MARK MAZZETTI |author2=JUSTIN ELLIOTT |title=Spies Infiltrate a Fantasy Realm of Online Games|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/world/spies-dragnet-reaches-a-playing-field-of-elves-and-trolls.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=12 December 2013|date=9 December 2013}}</ref>

== Political espionage ==

According to the April 2013 summary of disclosures, the NSA defined its "intelligence priorities" on a scale of "1" (highest interest) to "5" (lowest interest).<ref name="spiegellaurapoitras"/> It classified about 30 countries as "3rd parties", with whom it cooperates but also spies on:

* '''Main targets''': China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan were ranked highly on the NSA's list of spying priorities, followed by France, Germany, Japan, and Brazil. The [[European Union]]'s "international trade" and "economic stability" are also of interest.<ref name="spiegellaurapoitras"/> Other high priority targets include Cuba, Israel, and North Korea.<ref name="WaPo20130829">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/black-budget-summary-details-us-spy-networks-successes-failures-and-objectives/2013/08/29/7e57bb78-10ab-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html|title=U.S. spy network's successes, failures and objectives detailed in 'black budget' summary|authors=Barton Gellman and Greg Miller|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=29 August 2013|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>
* '''Irrelevant''': From a US intelligence perspective, countries such as Cambodia, Laos and Nepal were largely irrelevant, as were governments of smaller European Union countries such as Finland, Denmark, Croatia and the Czech Republic.<ref name="spiegellaurapoitras"/>

Other prominent targets included members and adherents of the Internet group known as "[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]",<ref name="spiegellaurapoitras"/> as well as potential whistleblowers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maass|first=Peter|title=How Laura Poitras Helped Snowden Spill His Secrets|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=13 August 2013}}</ref> According to Snowden, the NSA targeted reporters who wrote critically about the government after 9/11.<ref>{{cite web|last=Easley|first=Jonathan|title=Snowden: NSA targeted journalists critical of government after 9/11 |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/316751-snowden-nsa-targeted-journalists-critical-of-government-after-911|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref>

As part of a joint operation with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), the NSA deployed secret eavesdropping posts in eighty U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide.<ref name="spiegel1000"/> The headquarters of [[NATO]] were also used by NSA experts to spy on the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Laura Poitras |author2=Marcel Rosenbach |author3=Fidelius Schmid |author4=Holger Stark |title=Attacks from America: NSA Spied on European Union Offices|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/nsa-spied-on-european-union-offices-a-908590.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>
