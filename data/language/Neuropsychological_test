'''Neuropsychological tests''' are specifically designed tasks used to measure a psychological function known to be linked to a particular brain structure or pathway.<ref>Boyle, G.J., Saklofske, D.H., & Matthews, G. (2012). (Eds.), SAGE Benchmarks in Psychology: Psychological Assessment, Vol. 3: Clinical Neuropsychological Assessment. London: SAGE. {{ISBN|978-0-85702-270-7}}</ref> Tests are used for [[cognitive neuropsychology|research]] into brain function and in a [[clinical neuropsychology|clinical]] setting for the diagnosis of deficits. They usually involve the systematic administration of clearly defined procedures in a formal environment. Neuropsychological tests are typically administered to a single person working with an examiner in a quiet office environment, free from distractions. As such, it can be argued that neuropsychological tests at times offer an estimate of a person's peak level of cognitive performance. Neuropsychological tests are a core component of the process of conducting [[neuropsychological assessment]], along with personal, interpersonal and contextual factors.

Most neuropsychological tests in current use are based on traditional [[psychometric]] theory. In this model, a person's [[raw score]] on a test is compared to a large general population [[normative]] sample, that should ideally be drawn from a comparable population to the person being examined. Normative studies frequently provide data stratified by age, level of education, and/or ethnicity, where such factors have been shown by research to affect performance on a particular test. This allows for a person's performance to be compared to a suitable [[control group]], and thus provide a fair assessment of their current cognitive function.

According to Larry J. Seidman, the analysis of the wide range of neuropsychological tests can be broken down into four categories. First is an analysis of overall performance, or how well people do from test to test along with how they perform in comparison to the average score. Second is left-right comparisons: how well a person performs on specific tasks that deal with the left and right side of the body. Third is pathognomic signs, or specific test results that directly relate to a distinct disorder. Finally, the last category is differential patterns, which are strange test scores that are typical for specific diseases or types of damage.<ref> Seidman, Larry J. (1998). Neuropsychological testing. Harvard Mental Health Letter, 14 (11), 4-6.</ref>

==Categories==
Most forms of cognition actually involve multiple cognitive functions working in unison, however tests can be organised into broad categories based on the cognitive function which they predominantly assess.<ref>{{cite book |title=Neuropsychological Assessment |last1=Lezak |first1=Muriel D. |last2=Howieson |first2=Diane B. |last3=Bigler |first3=Erin D. |last4=Tranel |first4=Daniel |date=2012 |edition=Fifth |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-539552-5 |url=http://global.oup.com/academic/product/neuropsychological-assessment-9780195395525 |accessdate=17 June 2014 |laysummary=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8895431&fileId=S1355617713000337 |laysource=Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society |laydate=17 June 2014 |ref=harv}}</ref> Some tests appear under multiple headings as different versions and aspects of tests can be used to assess different functions.

===Intelligence===
[[Intelligence]] testing in a research context is relatively more straightforward than in a clinical context. In research, intelligence is tested and results are generally as obtained, however in a clinical setting intelligence may be impaired so estimates are required for comparison with obtained results. [[Premorbid]] estimates can be determined through a number of methods, the most common include: 
comparison of test results to expected achievement levels based on prior education and occupation and the use of [[hold test]]s which are based on cognitive faculties which are generally good indicators of intelligence and thought to be more resistant to cognitive damage, e.g. language.

*[[Wechsler Test of Adult Reading|Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR)]]

===Memory===
[[Memory]] is a very broad function which includes several distinct abilities, all of which can be selectively impaired and require individual testing. There is disagreement as to the number of memory systems, depending on the psychological perspective taken. From a clinical perspective, a view of five distinct types of memory, is in most cases sufficient.<ref>{{cite book |title=Neuropsychological Assessment |last1=Lezak |first1=Muriel D. |last2=Howieson |first2=Diane B. |last3=Bigler |first3=Erin D. |last4=Tranel |first4=Daniel |date=2012 |edition=Fifth |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-539552-5 |url=http://global.oup.com/academic/product/neuropsychological-assessment-9780195395525 |accessdate=17 June 2014 |laysummary=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8895431&fileId=S1355617713000337 |laysource=Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society |laydate=17 June 2014 |ref=harv}}</ref> '''Semantic memory''' and '''episodic memory''' (collectively called [[declarative memory]] or explicit memory); '''procedural memory''' and '''priming''' or perceptual learning (collectively called [[non-declarative memory]] or implicit memory) all four of which are long term memory systems; and '''working memory''' or short term memory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mayes, A.

===Dementia specific===
[[Dementia]] testing is often done by way of testing the cognitive functions that are most often impaired by the disease e.g. memory, orientation, language and problem solving. Tests such as these are by no means conclusive of deficits, but may give a good indication as to the presence or severity of dementia.
*[[Clinical Dementia Rating]]
*Dementia Rating Scale

===Batteries assessing multiple neuropsychological functions===
There are some test batteries which combine a range of tests to provide an overview of cognitive skills. These are usually good early tests to rule out problems in certain functions and provide an indication of functions which may need to be tested more specifically.

== Benefits of Neuropsychological Testing ==
The most beneficial factor of neuropsychological assessment is that it provides an accurate diagnosis of the disorder for the patient when it is unclear to the psychologist what exactly he/she has. This allows for accurate treatment later on in the process because treatment is driven by the exact symptoms of the disorder and how a specific patient may react to different treatments. The assessment allows the psychologist and patient to understand the severity of the deficit and to allow better decision-making by both parties.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://newyorkassessment.com|title = Neuropsychological and Psychoeducational Testing for Children and Adults|date = December 2015|access-date = February 2016|website = New York Assessment|publisher = }}</ref> It is also helpful in understanding deteriorating diseases because the patient can be assessed multiple times to see how the disorder is progressing.
