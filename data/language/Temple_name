'''Temple names''' are commonly used when naming most [[List of Chinese monarchs|Chinese]], [[List of monarchs of Korea|Korean]] ([[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] dynasties), and [[List of monarchs of Vietnam|Vietnamese]] (such dynasties as [[Trần dynasty|Trần]], [[Lý dynasty|Lý]], and [[Lê dynasty|Lê]]) monarchs. They should not be confused with [[Chinese era name|era name]]s and [[posthumous name]]s.

Compared to posthumous names, the use of temple names is more exclusive. Both titles were given after death to a ruler, but unlike the often elaborate posthumous name, a temple name almost always consists of only two [[Chinese characters|character]]s:

# an adjective: chosen to reflect the circumstances of the emperor's reign (such as "Martial" or "Lamentable").  The vocabulary overlaps with that of posthumous titles' adjectives, but for one emperor, the temple name's adjective character usually does not repeat as one of the many adjective characters in his posthumous name. The usual exception is "Filial" (孝). The founders are almost always either "High" (高) or "Grand" (太).
# "emperor": either ''zǔ'' (祖) or ''zōng'' (宗).
#* ''Zu'' ("forefather") implies a progenitor, either a founder of a dynasty or a new line within an existing one. ''Zu'' is also given to monarchs with great accomplishment. The equivalent in Korean is ''jo'' (조), and ''tổ'' in Vietnamese.
#* ''Zong'' ("ancestor") is used in all other rulers. It is rendered as ''jong'' (종) in Korean, and ''tông'' in Vietnamese.

The "temple" in "temple name" refers to the "[[Imperial Ancestral Temple|grand temple]]" (太廟), also called "great temple" (大廟) or "ancestral temple" (祖廟), where [[crown prince]]s and other royalty gathered to worship their ancestors.  The ancestral tablets in the grand temple recorded the temple names of the rulers.

In earlier times, only rulers had temple names, such as Taihao (太昊). Temple names were assigned sporadically from the [[Shang dynasty]] and regularly from the [[Tang dynasty]].  Some [[Han dynasty|Han]] emperors had their temple names permanently removed by their descendants in 190 AD. Temple names are the usual way to refer to emperors from the Tang dynasty up to the [[Ming dynasty]]. For the Ming dynasty and [[Qing dynasty]] (from 1368 AD), [[Chinese era name|era name]]s are often used instead.

In Korea, temple names are used to refer to kings of the early Goryeo (until 1274 AD), and kings and emperors of Joseon. For the [[Korean Empire]], era names should be used, but the temple names are often used instead.<ref>{{cite book|title=Korea: a historical and cultural dictionary|author1=Keith Pratt |author2=Richard Rutt |author3=James Hoare |year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-0464-7}}</ref> In Vietnam, most rulers are known by their temple names, with the exception of [[Tây Sơn dynasty|Tây Sơn]] and [[Nguyễn dynasty|Nguyễn]] monarchs, who are better known by their era names.

Numerous individuals who did not serve as monarch during their lifetime were posthumously promoted to "emperor" or "king" by their descendants and given temple names.
