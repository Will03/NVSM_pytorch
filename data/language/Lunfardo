'''Lunfardo''' (from the Italian ''lumbardo'' (it is not proven) or inhabitant of [[Lombardy]] in the local dialect) is a [[dialect]] originated and developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the lower classes in [[Buenos Aires]] and from there spread to other cities nearby, such as the surrounding area [[Greater Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario]] and [[Montevideo]]. <ref>[http://www.agenciaelvigia.com.ar/historia_del_lunfardo.htm Lunfardo history, with historical accounts in newspapers of the nineteenth century.]</ref><ref>[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=lunfardo Definition of the word "Lunfardo"according to the RAE.]</ref> 

Originally, Lunfardo was a slang used by criminals and soon by other people of the lower and lower-middle classes. Later, many of its words and phrases were introduced in the vernacular and disseminated the [[Rioplatense Spanish|Spanish]] of [[Argentina]], and [[Uruguay]]. Nevertheless, since the early 20th century, Lunfardo has spread among all social strata and classes by habitual use or because it was common in the lyrics of [[tango music|tango]].

==Origin==
Lunfardo (or ''lunfa'' for short) began as prison slang in the late 19th century so guards would not understand prisoners. According to Oscar Conde, the word came from "lumbardo" (the inhabitants of the region [[Lombardia]] in [[Italy]], the origin of most of the Italians in Argentina in the early 19th century).<ref>Conde. "Un estudio sobre el habla popular de los argentinos". Introduction</ref>  However, the vernacular Spanish of mid-19th century Buenos Aires as preserved in the dialogue of [[Esteban Echeverría|Esteban Echeverría's]] short story [[The Slaughter Yard]] (El matadero) is already a prototype of Lunfardo.<ref>The story may be read on Wikisource: https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/El_Matadero.</ref>

==Etymology==

Most sources believe that Lunfardo originated among criminals, and later became more commonly used by other classes. Circa 1870, the word ''lunfardo'' itself (originally a deformation of ''[[Lombard language|lombardo]]'' in several Italian dialects) was often used to mean "outlaw".

==Lunfardo today==
Today, some Lunfardo terms have entered the language spoken all over Argentina and Uruguay, although a great number of Lunfardo words have fallen into disuse or have been modified in the era of [[suburbanization]]. Furthermore, the term "Lunfardo" has become synonymous with "speech of Buenos Aires" or "Porteño", mainly of the inhabitants of the [[City of Buenos Aires]], as well as its surrounding areas, [[Greater Buenos Aires]]. The Montevideo speech has almost as much "lunfardo slang" as the Buenos Aires speech. Conde says the lunfardo (much like the [[cocoliche]]) can be considered a kind of Italian dialect mixed with Spanish words, specifically the one spoken in [[Montevideo]].  In other words, the lunfardo is an ''interlanguage variety'' of the Italian dialects spoken by immigrants in the areas of Buenos Aires and Montevideo.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[Argentina]], any [[neologism]] that reached a minimum level of acceptance is considered, by default, a Lunfardo term. The original slang has been immortalized in numerous [[tango music|tango]] lyrics.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Conde has expressed that the Lunfardo is not so much a dialect but a kind of local language of the Italian immigrants, mixed with Spanish and some French words.<ref>Oscar Conde: Lunfardo. Un estudio sobre el habla popular de los argentinos; pág. 43</ref> He believes that Lunfardo is not a criminal slang, since most of the lunfardo words are not related to crime.<ref>Conde; p. 55</ref>

According to Conde, Lunfardo

{{Quote|...is a vernacular, or to put it more clearly, is a vocabulary of popular speech in Buenos Aires that spread first throughout the  River Plate area and later to the whole country ... The use of this lexicon reminds speakers of their identity but also of their roots... lunfardo is possibly the only argot that was originally formed, and in great measure, from Italian immigrant terms.  [''Es un modo de expresión popular o, para decirlo más claramente, un vocabulario del habla popular de Buenos Aires…que se ha extendido primero a toda la región del Río de la Plata y luego al país entero…el uso de este léxico les recuerda a sus usuarios quiénes son, pero también de dónde vienen…el lunfardo es posiblemente el único que en su origen se formó, y en un alto porcentaje, con términos italianos inmigrados''].<ref>Conde; p. 109</ref>}}

==Characteristics==

Lunfardo words are inserted in the normal flow of [[Rioplatense Spanish]] sentences, but grammar and pronunciation do not change. Thus, an average Spanish-speaking person reading tango lyrics will need, at most, the translation of a discrete set of words.

Tango lyrics use lunfardo sparsely, but some songs (such as ''El Ciruja'', or most lyrics by Celedonio Flores) employ lunfardo heavily. "Milonga Lunfarda" by [[Edmundo Rivero]] is an instructive and entertaining primer on lunfardo usage.

A characteristic of lunfardo is its use of [[word play]], notably ''[[vesre]]'' (from "[al] revés"), reversing the syllables, similar to English [[back slang]], French [[verlan]] or Greek [[ποδανά|podaná]]. Thus, ''tango'' becomes ''gotán'' and ''café con leche'' (coffee with milk) becomes ''feca con chele''.

Lunfardo employs metaphors such as ''bobo'' ("dumb") for the [[heart]], who "works all day long without being paid" or ''bufoso'' ("snorter") for [[pistol]].

Finally, there are words that are derived from others in Spanish, such as the verb ''abarajar'', which means to stop a situation or a person (such as ''to stop your opponent's blows with the blade of your knife'') and is related to the verb "barajar", which means to cut or shuffle a deck of cards.

==Modern slang==

Since the 1970s, it is a matter of debate whether newer additions to the slang of Buenos Aires qualify as lunfardo.  Traditionalists argue that lunfardo ''must'' have a link to the argot of the old underworld, to tango lyrics, or to racetrack slang. Others maintain that the colloquial language of Buenos Aires is lunfardo by definition.

Some examples of modern talk:

* ''Gomas'' (lit. ''tires'') - woman's breasts
* ''Maza'' (lit. ''mace'' or ''sledgehammer'') - superb
* ''Curtir'' (lit. ''to tan'') - to be involved in
* ''Curtir fierros'' can mean "to be into car mechanics" or "to be into firearms", ''Fierro'' is the Old Spanish form of ''hierro'' (iron). In Argentine parlance, it can mean a firearm or anything related to metals and mechanics, for example a racing car.
* ''Zafar'' - to barely get by; Zafar is actually a standard Spanish verb (originally meaning ''to extricate oneself'') that had fallen out of use and was restored to everyday Buenos Aires speech in the 1970s by students, with the meaning of "barely passing (an examination)"
* ''Trucho'' - counterfeit, fake; Trucho is from old Spanish slang ''truchamán'', which in turn derives from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''turjeman'' ("translator", referring specifically to a person who accosts foreigners and lures them into [[tourist trap]]s). [[Folk etymology]] derives this word from ''trucha'' ([[trout]]), or from the Italian ''[[wikt:trucco|trucco]]'', something made fake on purpose. [http://www.libertaddigital.com/php3/opi_desa.php3?cpn=22645 Reference (Spanish)]

Many new terms had spread from specific areas of the dynamic Buenos Aires cultural scene: invented by screenwriters, used around the arts-and-crafts fair in Plaza Francia, culled from the vocabulary of [[psychoanalysis]].

==Influence from [[Cocoliche]]==
Lunfardo was influenced by Cocoliche, a dialect of [[Italian Argentine|Italian immigrants]].<ref>[http://cvc.cervantes.es/literatura/aispi/pdf/14/14_073.pdf  Cocoliche e Lunfardo: l'italiano dell'Argentina (in Italian).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222045910/http://cvc.cervantes.es/literatura/aispi/pdf/14/14_073.pdf |date=2016-02-22 }}</ref>  Many  [[cocoliche]] words were transferred to Lunfardo in the first half of the 20th century. For example:-
* ''manyar'' (to eat) from [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Lombard language|Lombard]] "magnar" (''mangiare'' in Italian) 
* ''lonyipietro'' (fool)
* ''fungi'' (mushroom) -> in Lunfardo: hat
* ''vento'' (wind) -> in Lunfardo: money
* ''matina'' (morning) from Italian "mattina"
* ''mina'' (girl) from [[Lombard language|Lombard]] "mina" (''busty woman'' or ''prostitute'') 
* ''laburar'' (to work) from Italian "lavorare"
* ''minga'' (nothing) from [[Lombard language|Lombard]] "minga" (negative particle like ''not'' in English or ''ne pas'' in French)
* ''yeta'' (bad luck) from [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] "[[wikt:iettatore|iettatore]]"
* ''yira'' (to go for a walk) from Italian "girare"
* ''salute'' (cheers) from Italian "salute"
* ''fiaca'' (laziness) from Italian "fiacca"

Some Italian linguists,<ref>A. Cancellier. ''Italiano e spagnolo a contatto nel Rio de La Plata'' Università di Milano. Milano, 2006</ref> because of the Cocoliche influences, argue that the Lunfardo can be considered a ''[[pidgin]]'' of the [[Italian language]].

==Suffixes==

A rarer feature of Porteño speech that can make it completely unintelligible is the random addition of suffixes with no particular meaning, usually making common words sound reminiscent of Italian surnames. These endings include -''etti'', -''elli'' ''eli'', -''oni'', -''eni'', -''anga'', -''ango'', -''enga'', -''engue'', -''engo'', -''ingui'', -''ongo'', -''usi'', -''ula'', -''usa'', -''eta'', among others.
