{{For|the ancient Roman toponym and the Romantic-era personification of Germany and German-speaking peoples|Germania}}

'''Germanía''' is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term for the [[argot]] used by [[crime|criminals]] or in [[prison|jails]] in [[Spain]] during 15th and 16th centuries. Its purpose is to keep outsiders out of the conversation. The ultimate origin of the word is the Latin word ''germanus'', through Catalan ''germà'' (brother).

Some documentation for it occurs in [[picaresque]] works as early as the [[Spanish Golden Century]], such as in [[Francisco de Quevedo|Quevedo's]] ''[[El Buscón]]''.<ref>Christopher J. Pountain, ''A History of the Spanish Language Through Texts'' (Routledge, 2000), 159.</ref>  Some writers used it in poetry for comical effect.

After the arrival of the [[Romani people]] and their frequent imprisonment, ''germanía'' incorporated much vocabulary from [[Romany language|Romany]] and its descendant, the ''[[Caló language|caló]]'' jargon. As time passed, several words entered popular use and even standard Spanish, losing their value for secrecy. ''Germanía''  survives today in the ''[[cheli]]'' jargon.

==War of the Germanías==
{{main|Revolt of the Brotherhoods}}
The term '''''germanía''''' ("brotherhood" in Catalan—compare with [[Galician language|Galician]] ''irmandade'' and Castilian ''hermandad'') originated from the name of a revolt against the local nobility in [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], Spain during the sixteenth century.  Subsequently, the term referred to the argot used by these communities and, eventually, it referred to improper argot.

==Use in Literature==
Characters in the original Spanish version of [[Arturo Pérez-Reverte|Arturo Pérez-Reverte's]] [[Captain Alatriste]] series make use of germanía. Pérez-Reverte gave a speech on the subject of germanía to the Real Academia Española de la Lengua after they invited him to join the academy for the work he had done on the series.<ref>Barbara Hoffert, "Q&A Arturo Pérez-Reverte", ''[[Library Journal]]'', p. 77, 2005-4-15, translated to English by Carmen Ospina.</ref>
