'''Word games''' (also called word game [[puzzle]]s) are spoken or board games often designed to test ability with language or to explore its properties.

Word games are generally used as a source of [[entertainment]], but can additionally serve an [[education]]al purpose. Young children can enjoy playing games such as [[Hangman (game)|Hangman]], while naturally developing important language skills like spelling. While Hangman is a seriously dark game, what we like to focus on is the development of the children.  Researchers have found that adults who regularly solved [[crossword]] puzzles, which require familiarity with a larger [[vocabulary]], had better brain function later in life.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rd.com/culture/crossword-puzzles-can-make-you-smarter/|title=Yes, Doing Crossword Puzzles CAN Make You Smarter {{!}} Reader's Digest|date=2017-07-25|work=Reader's Digest|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-US}}</ref>

Popular word-based [[Game show|game shows]] have been a part of television and radio throughout broadcast history, including [[Spelling Bee (game show)|Spelling Bee]] (the first televised game show) and [[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]] (the longest-running syndicated game show in the United States).

== Categories of word game ==

=== Letter arrangement games ===
In a letter arrangement game, the goal is to form words out of given letters. These games generally test vocabulary skills as well as lateral thinking skills. Some examples of letter arrangement games include [[Scrabble]], [[Upwords]], [[Bananagrams]], [[Countdown (game show)|''Countdown'']], and Paperback.

=== Paper and pencil games ===

[[File:Crossword solving using ballpoint pen.jpg|thumb|A crossword puzzle]]In a paper and pencil game, players write their own words, often under specific constraints. For example, a [[crossword]] requires players to use clues to fill out a grid, with words intersecting at specific letters. Other examples of paper and pencil games include [[Hangman (game)|Hangman]], [[Scattergories]], and [[Word search|word searches]].

=== Semantic games ===

Semantic games focus on the [[semantics]] of words, utilising their meanings and the shared knowledge of players as a mechanic. [[Mad Libs]], [[Blankety Blank|''Blankety'' ''Blank'']], and [[Codenames (board game)|Codenames]] are all semantic games. 

== Modern word games ==
As part of the modern "Golden Age" of board games, designers have created a variety of newer, non-traditional word games, often with more complex rules. Games like Codenames, Decrypto, and Anomia were all designed after 2010, and have earned widespread acclaim<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/the-best-games-and-gear-for-game-night/|title=The best games and gear for game night|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/14/board-games-ticket-to-ride-new-york-and-decrypto|title=Board games: Ticket to Ride New York and Decrypto|last=Duffy|first=Owen|date=2018-08-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/21/the-best-trivia-board-games|title=The Best Trivia Board Games|last=Thrower|first=Matt|date=2018-02-21|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}</ref>.
