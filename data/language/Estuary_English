'''Estuary English''' is an [[regional accents of English|English accent]] associated with the area along the [[River Thames]] and its [[Thames Estuary|estuary]]. Phonetician [[John C. Wells]] proposed a definition of Estuary English as "Standard English spoken with the accent of the southeast of England". Estuary English may be compared with [[Cockney]], and there is some debate among linguists as to where Cockney speech ends and Estuary English begins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/ee-faqs-jcw.htm |title=Estuary English Q and A - JCW |publisher=Phon.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universalteacher.org.uk/lang/joanna-ryfa-estuary.pdf|title=Estuary English - A controversial Issue?|author=Joanna Ryfa|date=2003|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> In October 1984, David Rosewarne in the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]''  suggested that it may eventually replace [[Received Pronunciation]] in the southeast.<ref name=rosewarne>{{cite web|url=https://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/rosew.htm |title=Rosewarne, David (1984).

==Name==
The scholar Alan Cruttenden uses the term '''London Regional General British'''<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gimson|2014|pp=81–82}}</ref><ref name="phon">{{cite web|title=Phonetics at Oxford University|url=http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/general-british|accessdate=17 May 2015}}</ref> in preference to the popular term 'Estuary English'.

The names listed above may be abbreviated:
* Estuary English → EE
* London Regional General British → London General,<ref name="crut82">{{Harvcoltxt|Gimson|2014|p=82}}</ref> London Regional GB,<ref name="phon"/> London RGB<ref name="crut82"/>

Some authors<ref>Such as {{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982}}</ref> use different names for EE closer to Cockney ('''''Popular London''''') and EE closer to Received Pronunciation ('''''London Regional Standard''''' or '''''South-Eastern Regional Standard''''').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=302–303}}</ref>

Note that some other authors<ref>Such as {{Harvcoltxt|Gimson|2014}}</ref> use the name '''''Popular London''''' to refer to Cockney itself.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gimson|2014|p=89}}</ref>

==Status as accent of English==
The boundary between Estuary English and Cockney is far from clearcut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/maidment.htm | title=Estuary English: Hybrid or Hype?| last=Maidment|first=J. A.| year=1994|work= Paper presented at the 4th New Zealand Conference on Language & Society, Lincoln University, Christchurch, New Zealand, August 1994.| publisher=[[University College London]]|accessdate=2009-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/haenni1999.pdf|last=Haenni| first=Ruedi| year=1999| title=The case of Estuary English: supposed evidence and a perceptual approach| work=[[University of Basel]] dissertation| publisher=University College London|accessdate=2009-04-21}}</ref> Several writers have argued that Estuary English is not a discrete accent distinct from the accents of the London area. The sociolinguist [[Peter Trudgill]] has written that the term "Estuary English" is inappropriate because "it suggests that we are talking about a new variety, which we are not; and because it suggests that it is a variety of English confined to the banks of the Thames estuary, which it is not. The label actually refers to the lower middle-class accents, as opposed to working-class accents, of the Home Counties Modern Dialect area".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Trudgill|1999|p=80}}</ref> [[Peter Roach (phonetician) | Peter Roach]] comments, "In reality there is no such accent and the term should be used with care. The idea originates from the sociolinguistic observation that some people in public life who would previously have been expected to speak with an RP accent now find it acceptable to speak with some characteristics of the London area... such as glottal stops, which would in earlier times have caused comment or disapproval".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roach|first1=Peter|title=English Phonetics and Phonology|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-71740-3|page=4}}</ref> 

{{Harvcoltxt|Foulkes|Docherty|1999}} state "All of its [EE's] features can be located on a sociolinguistic and geographical continuum between [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] and [[Cockney]], and are spreading not because Estuary English is a coherent and identifiable influence, but because the features represent neither the standard nor the extreme non-standard poles of the continuum".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Foulkes|Docherty|1999|p=11}}</ref> In order to tackle these problems put forward by expert linguists, {{Harvcoltxt|Altendorf|2016}} argues that Estuary English should be viewed as a folk category rather than an expert linguistic category. As such it takes the form of a perceptual prototype category that does not require discrete boundaries in order to function in the eyes (and ears) of lay observers of language variation and change.<ref> {{Harvcoltxt|Altendorf|2016}}</ref>

Estuary English is characterised by the following features:

* [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|Non-rhoticity]].
* Use of [[intrusive R]]: pronouncing {{IPA|/r/}} in places that etymologically no {{IPA|/r/}} is present to prevent consecutive vowel sounds. For instance, ''drawing'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ˈdrɔːrɪŋ/}}.
* Presence of several vowel splits<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pronunciationstudio.com/a-london-accent/|title=A London Accent - Pronunciation Studio|website=pronunciationstudio.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref>:
** [[English-language vowel changes before historic l#Wholly–holy split|Wholly-holy split]],<ref name="ryfa">[http://www.universalteacher.org.uk/lang/joanna-ryfa-estuary.pdf Estuary English: A Controversial Issue?] by Joanna Ryfa, from universalteacher.org.uk</ref> so ''wholly'' {{IPA|/ˈhɒʊli/}} is pronounced differently from ''holy'' {{IPA|/ˈhəʊli/}}.
** [[Phonological history of English high back vowels#Foot-strut split|Foot-strut split]] so ''foot'' {{IPA|/fʊt/}} does not rhyme with ''strut'' {{IPA|/strʌt/}}.
** [[Phonological history of English short A#Trap-bath split|Trap-bath split]] so ''trap'' {{IPA|/træp/}} has a different vowel to ''bath'' {{IPA|/bɑːθ/}}.
** Another split that has been reported is the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} split, which causes ''board'' {{IPA|/bɔːd/}} to be pronounced differently from ''bored'' {{IPA|/bɔəd/}}.<ref name="parsons39">{{Harvcoltxt|Parsons|1998|p=39}}</ref> {{IPA|/ɔː/}} (phonetically {{IPA|[ɔʊ]}} or {{IPAblink|oː}})<ref name="parsons39"/> appears before consonants, and {{IPA|/ɔə/}} (phonetically {{IPA|[ɔə]}} or {{IPAblink|ɔː}})<ref name="parsons39"/> appears at a morpheme boundary.<ref name="parsons39"/> However, {{Harvcoltxt|Przedlacka|2001}} states that both {{IPA|/ɔː/}} and {{IPA|/ɔə/}} may have the same monophthongal quality {{IPAblink|ɔː}}.<ref name="przed43">{{Harvcoltxt|Przedlacka|2001|p=43}}</ref>
* [[T glottalization|T glottalisation]]: the non-initial, most-commonly final {{IPA|/t/}} is a [[glottal stop]] instead of an [[alveolar stop]]: ''can't'' (pronounced {{IPA|[kɑːnʔ]}}).
* [[Yod-coalescence]], the use of the affricates {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}} and {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}} instead of the clusters {{IPA|[dj]}} and {{IPA|[tj]}} in words like ''dune'' and ''Tuesday''. Thus, the words sound like ''June'' and ''choose day'', respectively.
* Realization of non-prevocalic {{IPA|/l/}} different from that found in traditional RP; four variants are possible:
** [[L-vocalization|''L''-vocalisation]], the use of {{IPA|[o]}}, {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, or {{IPA|[ɯ]}} in places that RP uses {{IPA|[ɫ]}} in the final positions or in a final consonant cluster: ''sold'' (pronounced {{IPA|[sɔʊd]}}). In London, that may even occur before a vowel: ''girl out'' {{IPA|[ɡɛo ˈæoʔ]}}.<ref name="ashby">{{Harvcoltxt|Ashby|2011}}</ref> In all phonetic environments, male London speakers were at least twice as likely to vocalize the dark l as female London speakers.<ref name="ashby"/>
** According to {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}, the vocalized dark l is sometimes an unoccluded lateral approximant, which differs from the RP {{IPA|[ɫ]}} only by the lack of the alveolar contact.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=193}}</ref>
** Coda {{IPA|/l/}} pronounced as clear {{IPAblink|l}}, as in most accents of [[Irish English]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Przedlacka|2001}} notes that in her study, "all four Essex speakers have a clear {{IPA|[l]}} in ''pull''."<ref name="przed45">{{Harvcoltxt|Przedlacka|2001|p=45}}</ref> In [[New Zealand English]], word-final clear {{IPA|/l/}}, as opposed to usual in that variety vocalised {{IPA|[ɯ]}},<ref name="baueretal101">{{Harvcoltxt|Bauer|Warren|Bardsley|Kennedy|2007|p=101}}</ref> has also been reported for some speakers.<ref name="baueretal101"/> A reverse process, clear {{IPAblink|l}} realised as dark {{IPAblink|ɫ}}, has not been reported in Estuary English.
** Alternation between the vocalized {{IPA|[o ~ ʊ ~ ɯ]}}, dark non-vocalized {{IPA|[ɫ]}} and clear non-vocalized {{IPA|[l]}}, depending on the word.<ref name="przed45"/>
[[Image:Wide Southeastern GOAT on a vowel chart.svg|thumb|250px|A possible realization of Estuary {{IPA|/əʊ/}} on a vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Lodge|2009|p=175}}]]
* It has been suggested that [[th-fronting|''th''-fronting]] is "currently making its way" into Estuary English, for example those from [[Isle of Thanet]] often refer to Thanet as "Plannit Fannit" (Planet Thanet).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Altendorf|1999}}</ref>
* Vowel changes:
** {{IPA|/iː/}} (as in {{sc2|FLEECE}}) can be realised as {{IPAblink|iː}}, {{IPA|[ɪi]}} or {{IPA|[əi]}},<ref name="przed43"/> with the first two variants predominating.<ref name="przed42">{{Harvcoltxt|Przedlacka|2001|p=42}}</ref> Before the dark l, it is sometimes a centering diphthong {{IPA|[iə]}}.<ref name="przed43"/>
** {{IPA|/uː/}} (as in {{sc2|GOOSE}}) can be realised in many different ways, such as monophthongs {{IPAblink|ʏː}}, {{IPAblink|ɪ|ɪ̝ː}}, {{IPAblink|ʉː}}, {{IPAblink|ɨː}}, {{IPA|[ʉ̠ː]}}, {{IPAblink|u|u̟ː}}<ref name="przed43"/> and diphthongs {{IPA|[ɘɵ]}}, {{IPA|[ɘʏ]}}, {{IPA|[ʏɨ]}} and {{IPA|[ʊu]}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Przedlacka|2001|pp=43–44}}</ref> Front pronunciations ({{IPAblink|ʏː}}, {{IPAblink|ɪ|ɪ̝ː}}, {{IPA|[ɘʏ]}} and {{IPA|[ʏɨ]}}) are more often encountered in female speakers.<ref name="przed43"/> Before the l, it is always back.<ref name="wells94">{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1994}}</ref>
** {{IPA|/ʊ/}} can be central (rounded {{IPAblink|ʊ̈}} or unrounded {{IPAblink|ɪ̈}})<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Lodge|2009|p=174}}</ref> near-front {{IPAblink|ʏ}},<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Altendorf|Watt|2004|pp=188 and 191–192}}</ref> or simply near-back {{IPAblink|ʊ}}, as in RP. Only the last variant appears before the dark l.
** {{IPA|/ɔː/}} (as in {{sc2|THOUGHT}}), according to {{Harvcoltxt|Przedlacka|2001}}, can be pronounced in two different ways: diphthongal {{IPA|[oʊ]}} in closed syllables and {{IPA|[ɔə]}} or {{IPA|[ɔ̝ə]}} in open syllables<ref name="przed43"/> and monophthongal {{IPAblink|ɔː}}.<ref name="przed43"/> According to {{Harvcoltxt|Parsons|1998}}, it is either {{IPA|[ɔʊ]}} or {{IPAblink|oː}} before consonants, and either {{IPA|[ɔə]}} or {{IPA|[ɔː]}} at a morpheme boundary.<ref name="parsons39"/>
** {{IPA|/ʌ/}} (as in {{sc2|STRUT}}) can be realised as {{IPAblink|ɒ}}, {{IPAblink|ʌ}}, {{IPAblink|ɐ}}, {{IPA|[ɐ̟]}} or {{IPAblink|æ}},<ref name="przed43"/> with {{IPAblink|ɐ}} being predominant.<ref name="przed43"/> The first two variants occur mostly before {{IPA|/ŋ/}}.<ref name="przed43"/> The last two variants are more often used by females.<ref name="przed43"/>
** {{IPA|/æ/}} (as in {{sc2|TRAP}}) can be realised as {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPA|[a̝]}}, {{IPAblink|æ}}, {{IPA|[ɛ̞]}} or {{IPAblink|ɛ}}.<ref name="przed43"/><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Altendorf|Watt|2004|p=188}}. They list {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPA|[a̝]}} and {{IPAblink|æ}}.</ref> A somewhat retracted front {{IPA|[a̠]}} has been reported for some speakers in Reading.<ref name="alt188">{{Harvcoltxt|Altendorf|Watt|2004|p=188}}</ref>
** {{IPA|/əʊ/}} (as in {{sc2|GOAT}}) may be realised in a couple of different ways. According to {{Harvcoltxt|Przedlacka|2001}}, it is any of the following: {{IPA|[əʊ]}}, {{IPA|[ɐʊ]}}, {{IPA|[əʏ]}} or {{IPA|[ɐʏ]}}. The last two are more often used by females.<ref name="przed44">{{Harvcoltxt|Przedlacka|2001|p=44}}</ref> She also notes a fully rounded diphthong {{IPA|[oʊ]}} (found in some speakers from Essex),<ref name="przed44"/> as well as two rare monophthongal realizations, namely {{IPAblink|ɐː}} and {{IPAblink|o̞ː}}.<ref name="przed44"/> According to {{Harvcoltxt|Lodge|2009}}, Estuary {{IPA|/əʊ/}} may be pronounced {{IPA|[ɑːɪ̯̈]}} or {{IPA|[ɑːʏ̯̈]}}, with the first element somewhat lengthened and much more open than in RP and the second element being near-close central, with or without lip rounding.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Lodge|2009|p=175}}</ref>
** {{IPA|/eɪ/}} (as in {{sc2|FACE}}), according to {{Harvcoltxt|Przedlacka|2001}}, can be realised as {{IPA|[ɛ̝ɪ]}}, {{IPA|[ɛɪ]}}, {{IPA|[ɛ̞ɪ]}} or {{IPA|[æɪ]}},<ref name="przed44"/> with {{IPA|[ɛɪ]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ̞ɪ]}} being predominant.<ref name="przed44"/> According to {{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1994}}, it can be realised as {{IPA|[eɪ]}}, {{IPA|[ɛɪ]}}, {{IPA|[æɪ]}}, {{IPA|[ɐɪ]}} or {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}}.<ref name="wells94"/>
** {{IPA|/aɪ/}} (as in {{sc2|PRICE}}) can be realised as {{IPA|[aɪ]}}, {{IPA|[a̠ɪ]}}, {{IPA|[ɑ̟ɪ]}}, {{IPA|[ɒ̟ɪ]}}, {{IPA|[ɑɪ]}} or {{IPA|[ɒɪ]}}.<ref name="przed44"/>
** {{IPA|/aʊ/}} (as in {{sc2|MOUTH}}) can be realised as {{IPA|[aʊ]}}, {{IPA|[aʏ]}}, {{IPA|[æə]}}, {{IPA|[æʊ]}} or {{IPA|[æʏ]}}.<ref name="przed44"/> {{IPA|[a]}} denotes a front onset {{IPAblink|a}}, not a central one {{IPAblink|ä|a̠}}.<ref name="przed44"/>
* [[English-language vowel changes before historic /l/|Vowel mergers before historic {{IPA|/l/}}:]]
** {{IPA|/iːl/}} (as in {{sc2|REEL}}) merges with {{IPA|/ɪəl/}} (as in {{sc2|REAL}}).<ref name="wells94"/> 
** {{IPA|/ɔɪl/}} (as in {{sc2|OIL}}) merges with {{IPA|/ɔɪəl/}} (as in {{sc2|ROYAL}}).<ref name="wells94"/>
** {{IPA|/aʊl/}} (as in {{sc2|OWL}}) merges with {{IPA|/aʊəl/}} (as in {{sc2|VOWEL}}).<ref name="wells94"/>
** Other possible mergers include the following:
*** {{IPA|/iːl/}} (as in {{sc2|FEEL}}) can merge with {{IPA|/ɪl/}} (as in {{sc2|FILL}}).<ref name="wells94"/> Since {{IPA|/ɪəl/}} merges with {{IPA|/iːl/}},<ref name="wells94"/> it also participates in this merger.
*** {{IPA|/uːl/}} (as in {{sc2|POOL}}) can merge with both {{IPA|/ʊl/}} (as in {{sc2|PULL}}) and {{IPA|/ɔːl/}} (as in {{sc2|PAUL}}).<ref name="wells94"/>
*** {{IPA|/eɪl/}} (as in {{sc2|VEIL}}) can merge with both {{IPA|/æl/}} (as in {{sc2|VAL}}) and {{IPA|/aʊəl/}} (as in {{sc2|VOWEL}}).<ref name="wells94"/>
*** {{IPA|/ɛl/}} (as in {{sc2|WELL}}) can merge with {{IPA|/ɜːl/}} (as in {{sc2|WHIRL}}).<ref name="wells94"/>
*** {{IPA|/aɪl/}} (as in {{sc2|CHILD'S}}) can merge with {{IPA|/ɑːl/}} (as in {{sc2|CHARLES}}).<ref name="wells94"/>
*** {{IPA|/ɒl/}} (as in {{sc2|DOLL}}) can merge with {{IPA|/ɒʊl/}} (as in {{sc2|DOLE}}).<ref name="wells94"/>

Despite the similarity between the two dialects, the following characteristics of [[Cockney]] pronunciation are generally not present in Estuary English:

* [[H-dropping]] in stressed words ({{IPA|[æʔ]}} for ''hat'')<ref name="wells94"/>
* Monophthongal ({{IPAblink|æː}} or {{IPAblink|aː}}) realization of {{IPA|/aʊ/}} (as in {{sc2|MOUTH}}).<ref name="wells94"/>

==Use==
Estuary English is widely encountered throughout the south and the southeast of England, particularly among the young. Many consider it to be a [[working-class]] accent, but it is often used by lower middle classes as well. In the debate that surrounded a 1993 article about Estuary English, a London businessman claimed that RP was perceived as unfriendly and so Estuary English was now preferred for commercial purposes.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Crystal|2003|p=327}}</ref>

Some people adopt the accent as a means of "blending in" to appear to be more working class or in an attempt to appear to be "a common man". That affectation of the accent is sometimes derisively referred to as "[[Mockney]]". A move away from traditional RP accents is almost universal among middle-class young people.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crystal|first=David|title=RP and its successors|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/yourvoice/feature2_4.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 April 2011}}</ref>

The term "Estuary English" is sometimes used with [[pejorative]] [[connotation]]s: [[Sally Gunnell]], a former Olympic athlete who became a [[television presenter]] for [[Channel 4]] and the [[BBC]], quit the BBC, announcing she felt "very undermined" by the network's lack of support after she was widely criticised for her "uninspiring interview style" and "awful estuary English".<ref>{{cite web| title=BBC undermined me so I quit, says Gunnell| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-374122/BBC-undermined-I-quit-says-Gunnell.html| publisher=[[The Mail on Sunday]]| date=15 January 2006| accessdate=2009-04-21| author=Jo Knowsley}}</ref>
