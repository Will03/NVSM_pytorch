"'''School of suspicion'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->" is a phrase coined by [[Paul Ricœur]] in ''[[Freud and Philosophy]]'' (1965) to capture a common spirit that pervades the writings of [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Ricoeur |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Ricœur |others=Denis Savage (transl.) |title=Freud and Philosophy.

==Overview==
According to literary theorist [[Rita Felski]], it is "a distinctively modern style of interpretation that circumvents obvious or self-evident meanings in order to draw out less visible and less flattering truths;
<blockquote>"{{bracket|Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche}} share a commitment to unmasking 'the lies and [[illusion]]s of [[consciousness]]'; they are the architects of a distinctively modern style of interpretation that circumvents obvious or self-evident meanings in order to draw out less visible and less flattering truths ... Ricoeur's term has sustained an energetic after-life within religious studies, as well as in philosophy, intellectual history, and related fields."<ref>{{Cite journal | publisher = Media culture | url = http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/view/431 | first = Rita | last = Felski | authorlink=Rita Felski |title = Critique and the Hermeneutics of Suspicion | journal = M/C Journal | volume = 15 | number = 1 | year = 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

Felski also notes that "The 'hermeneutics of suspicion' is the name usually bestowed on [a] technique of reading texts against the grain and between the lines, of cataloging their omissions and laying bare their contradictions, of rubbing in what they fail to know and cannot represent."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Felski |first=Rita |title=Context Stinks |url=http://kclunc19.web.unc.edu/files/2014/10/FelskiRita-Context-Stinks.pdf |journal=[[New Literary History]] |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location=[[Baltimore, Maryland]] |date=Autumn 2011 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=573-591 |doi=10.1353/nlh.2011.0045}}</ref> In that sense, it can be seen as being related to [[Critique of ideology|ideology critique]].

==Types==
[[Ruthellen Josselson]] explains that "Ricoeur distinguishes between two forms of hermeneutics: a hermeneutics of faith which aims to restore meaning to a text and a hermeneutics of suspicion which attempts to decode meanings that are disguised."<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://ruthellenjosselson.com/articles/josselson.ni.14-1.1e.pdf |first=Ruthellen |last=Josselson |authorlink=Ruthellen Josselson |title=The Hermeneutics of Faith and the Hermeneutics of Suspicion |journal=Narrative Inquiry |publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] |location=[[Amsterdam]] |volume=14 |issue=1 |date=1 July 2004 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1075/ni.14.1.01jos |ISSN=1387-6740 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206142102/http://ruthellenjosselson.com/articles/josselson.ni.14-1.1e.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2016 |df= }}</ref>
