This is a '''list of the [[Etymology|etymologies]] of [[continent]] names''' as they are currently found on Earth.

== [[Africa]] ==

The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] used the name ''Africa terra'' – "land of the Afri" (plural, or "Afer" singular) – for the northern part of the continent that corresponds to modern-day [[Tunisia]].  The origin of ''Afer'' may be the Phoenician ''afar'', dust; the [[Afri]] tribe, who dwelt in Northern Africa around the area of [[Carthage]]; [[Greece|Greek]] ''aphrike'' (*ἀφρίκη), without cold; or [[Latin]] ''aprica'', sunny.

The name "Africa," which was originally used by the Romans to refer to present-day Tunisia, only began to be stretched to encompass a larger area when the provinces of [[Tripolitania]], [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] were subdued to the Diocesis of Africa, following the administrative restructuring of [[Diocletian]]. Later, when [[Justinian I]] reconquered lands of the former [[West Roman Empire]], all the regions from the [[Chelif River]] to the [[Gulf of Sidra]] were annexed to the [[Byzantine Empire]] as the "[[Exarchate of Africa]]".

During the Middle Ages, as the Europeans increased their knowledge and awareness of the size of the African continent, they progressively extended the name of Africa to the rest of the continent.

== [[Americas|America]] ==

{{Main|Naming of the Americas}}

The continents of North and South America (also [[Continent#Number|sometimes deemed]] as a single continent, America) are thought to be named after the Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] (who styled himself ''Americus Vespucius'' in [[Latin]]). Amerigo Vespucci was named after [[Emeric of Hungary (saint)|Saint Emeric]] of [[Hungary]].  Vespucci, following his four voyages exploring the coastlines of Venezuela and Brazil, first developed the idea that the newly discovered western land was in fact a continent. The German cartographer [[Martin Waldseemüller]] created the earliest known map showing the name ''America'', which he applied to the South American continent only. One later antique map labels the two landmasses "North America or Mexicana" and "South America or Peruana"{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}.

An alternative theory was proposed by the local Bristol antiquarian [[Alfred Hudd]] who proposed that the word America had evolved from Amerike or ap Meryk, based on a lost manuscript which he claimed to have seen. Alfred Hudd was an aristocrat who belonged to the [[Clifton Antiquarian Club]] of Bristol, founded in 1884 to arrange meetings and excursions for the study of objects of archaeological interest in the West of England and South Wales. He also collected butterflies, was a naturalist and member of the [[Bristol Naturalists' Society]]. Hudd proposed that the word "America" was originally applied to a destination across the western ocean, possibly an island or a fishing station in Newfoundland. After the king of Denmark and ruler of Iceland had cut off trade for fish, England sent out expeditions to find new sources. Hudd suggested Amerike's sponsorship made his name known in Bristol in association with the North American destinations prior to other mapmaking or voyages. The writer Jonathan Cohen noted he made a conjectural leap to reach that conclusion, and no extant evidence supports it.<ref>[http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html Jonathan Cohen, "The naming of America: fragments we've shored against ourselves"], early version appeared in ''American Voices'', 1998; this version at his website at Stony Brook University, accessed 10 july 2011</ref> In the 21st century, the scholar John Davies briefly mentioned the story as a kind of Welsh patriot piece.<ref name="John Davies">{{cite web|title=Wales and America|author=John Davies|url=http://spruce.flint.umich.edu/~ellisjs/Davies.PDF|accessdate=2008-11-30|publisher=''North American Journal of Welsh Studies,'' Vol. 1, Volume 1, Number 1-2, (Winter-Summer)|page=12|year=2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216234202/http://spruce.flint.umich.edu/~ellisjs/Davies.PDF|archivedate=2008-12-16|df=}}</ref>

== [[Antarctica]] ==

The word ''Antarctica'' comes from Greek ''antarktikos'' (ἀνταρκτικός), from ''anti'' (ἀντί) and ''arktikos'' (ἀρκτικός) "Arctic". Literally "opposite to the Arctic (opposite to the North)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O27-Antarctic.html|title=Antarctic facts, information, pictures - Encyclopedia.com articles about Antarctic|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=antarctic&searchmode=none|title=antarctic - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anti-|title=anti- - Origin and meaning of prefix anti- by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref> ''Arktikos'' comes from ''Arktos'', the Greek name for the constellation of the Great Bear [[Ursa Major]], visible only in the Northern Hemisphere, which comes from the ancient Greek word ἄρκτος ({{IPA-el|ˈarktos|lang}}), which means "bear".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=arctic&searchmode=none|title=arctic - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>

== [[Asia]] ==
The word ''Asia'' originated from the Ancient Greek word Ἀσία,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=asia|title=asia - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref> first attributed to [[Herodotus]] (about 440 BCE) in reference to [[Anatolia]] or to the [[Persian Empire]], in contrast to [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]].

It originally was just a name for the east bank of the [[Aegean Sea]], an area known to the [[Hittites]] as [[Assuwa]]. In early Classical times, the [[Greeks]] started using the term "Asia" to refer to the whole region known today as [[Anatolia]] (the peninsula which forms the Asian portion of present-day [[Turkey]]). The Roman Empire referred to the entire [[Lydia]]n region of what is now northeastern Turkey as the [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]]. Eventually, however, the name had been stretched progressively further east, until it came to encompass the much larger land area with which we associate it today, while the Anatolian Peninsula started being called "[[Asia Minor]]" or "The Lesser Asia" instead.

The deeper root of the etymology can only be guessed at. The following two possibilities have been suggested: 
* It could have originated from the [[Aegean languages|Aegean]] root "''Asis''" which means "muddy and silty" as a description of the eastern shores of the Aegean Sea.
* It could derive from the borrowed [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] root "''Asu''", which means varyingly "rising" or "light", of course a directional referring to the sunrise, Asia thus meaning 'Eastern Land'.

However, since the [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''Asia'' is in all likelihood related to [[Hittite language|Hittite]] [[Assuwa]], the etymology of one has to account for the other as well.

Personified in [[Greek mythology]] by the deity of the [[Asia (mythology)|same name]].

== [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] ==
The word ''Australia'' means "Southern Land" in [[New Latin]], adapted from the legendary pseudo-geographical ''[[Terra Australis Incognita]]'' ("Unknown Southern Land") dating back to the Roman era. First appearing as a corruption of the Spanish name for an island in [[Vanuatu]] in 1625,<ref>[[Purchas, Samuel]]. "[http://memory.loc.gov/service/rbc/rbdk/d0404/02951422.jpg A note of Australia del Espíritu Santo, written by Master Hakluyt]", in ''Hakluytus Posthumus'', Vol. IV, pp. 1422-1432. 1625.</ref> "Australia" was slowly popularized following the advocacy of the [[European maritime exploration of Australia|British explorer]] [[Matthew Flinders]] in his 1814 description of his circumnavigation of the island.<ref name="Flind">Flinders, Matthew. ''[http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/encounter/collection/B12985211_259_3.htm A Voyage to Terra Australis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111005442/http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/encounter/collection/B12985211_259_3.htm |date=2012-11-11 }}''. 1814.</ref> [[Lachlan Macquarie]], a [[Governor of New South Wales]], used the word in his dispatches to England and recommended it be formally adopted by the Colonial Office in 1817.<ref>Letter of 12 December 1817.

== [[Europe]] ==
[[File:Vase Europa and the bull.jpg|thumb|Image possibly depicting [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]]]
The name ''Europe'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''Europa'', which in turn derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Europa (mythology)|Εὐρώπη]], from εὐρύς ''eurys'' "wide" and ὤψ ''ops'' "face"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Europe|title=Europe - Origin and meaning of the name Europe by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref> (PIE ''*wer-'', "broad" ''*okw-'', "eye"). In [[Greek mythology]], Europa was the beautiful daughter of a Phoenician king named [[Agenor]] or Phoenix. When [[Zeus]] saw her, he transformed himself into a bull and approached her and her playing friends. She climbed onto the bull's back and it swam off to Crete, where she had three sons with it ([[Minos]], [[Rhadamanthus]] and [[Sarpedon]], the first two of which constitute, together with [[Aeacus]], the three judges of the [[Hades|underworld]]).

Another possibility, proposed by [[Ernest Klein]], is that it derives from the ancient Sumerian and Semitic root "Ereb", which carries the meaning of "darkness" or "descent", a reference to the region's western location in relation to Mesopotamia, the Levantine Coast, Anatolia, and the Bosporus. Thus the term would have meant the "land of the setting of the Sun" or, more generically, "Western land".

Greeks had sometimes used the term Europe only for the area inhabited by them, roughly corresponding in modern terms to the region between former Yugoslavia in the north and Turkey in the south. Through the centuries, however, it came to denote the whole land mass which is called Europe today.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511496813|title=The idea of Europe: from antiquity to the European Union|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|date=2002|publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center Press ; Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780511496813|location=Washington, DC; Cambridge; New York|pages=|language=English|chapter=Europe: Conceptualizing a Continent|chapter-url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam031/2001025960.pdf|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511496813}}</ref>

== [[Oceania]] ==
The word ''Oceania'' comes from the English word [[ocean]] for 'a large body of water'. It is ultimately derived from Greek [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BD%A8%CE%BA%CE%B5%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%8C%CF%82 Ὠκεανός] (''Okeanos''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=ocean&searchmode=none|title=ocean - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref> the great river or sea surrounding the disk of the Earth. Personified, in Greek Mythology, as [[Oceanus]], son of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and husband of [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]].

===[[Zealandia]]===
Zealandia ({{IPAc-en|z|iː|ˈ|l|æ|n|d|i|ə}}), also known as the New Zealand continent or Tasmantis, is a nearly submerged continental fragment that sank after breaking away from Australia 60–85 Ma (million years) ago, and most of it (93%) remains submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean. It derives its name from the island country of [[New Zealand]] which occupies the vast majority of its non-submerged land.

===[[Pangaea]]===
The name ''Pangaea/Pangea'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] ''pan'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|πᾶν}}}}, "all, entire, whole") and ''[[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|Γαῖα}}}}, "[[Mother goddess|Mother Earth]], land").<ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite web|title=Pangaea|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Pangaea&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref>{{refn|As "Pangaea", it appears in [[Greek mythology]] as [[Pangaea (mountain)|a mountain battle site]] during the [[Titanomachia]].
