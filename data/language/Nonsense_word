A '''stunt word''' is a nonsense word used for a special effect, or to attract attention, as part of a performance. Such words are a feature of the work of [[Dr. Seuss]] ("Sometimes I am quite certain there's a Jertain in the curtain").<ref>''Encyclopedic Graded Grammar'', Vol 2, {{ISBN|1-4357-4069-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2nLSaQKKHQ0C&pg=PA925&dq=%22stunt+word%22&lr= p. 925]</ref>
