This is an (incomplete) list of major textual variants in the [[New Testament]], with a focus on differences between [[Categories of New Testament manuscripts|categories of New Testament manuscript]].

* The [[Textus Receptus]] ([[Latin]]: "received text") is the name subsequently given to the succession of printed [[Greek language|Greek]] texts of the [[New Testament]] which was first collated by [[Desiderius Erasmus]] in the 16th century. It constituted the translation base for the translation of the New Testament into [[English language|English]] by [[William Tyndale]], the [[King James Version]], and most other [[Protestant reformation|Reformation-era]] New Testament translations throughout Western and [[Central Europe]].
* The Majority Text represents the [[Byzantine text-type]], which was used in Eastern Greek speaking churches and was dominant from the late [[middle ages]] onwards. It is similar to the Textus Receptus.
* The modern [[textual criticism|critical text]] (e.g. [[Novum Testamentum Graece]]) is close to the [[Alexandrian text-type]], which accounts for some of the earliest New Testament manuscripts; it stands behind most modern English translations of the New Testament including the [[American Standard Version]], [[New International Version]], [[Revised Standard Version]], [[New Revised Standard Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Jerusalem Bible]], [[New American Bible]], [[English Standard Version]], and others.

For a more comprehensive list which includes many minor variants, see [[Textual variants in the New Testament]].
