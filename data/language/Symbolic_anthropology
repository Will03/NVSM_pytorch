'''Symbolic anthropology''' or, more broadly, '''symbolic and interpretive anthropology''', is the study of cultural symbols and how those symbols can be used to gain a better understanding of a particular society. It is often viewed in contrast to [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]].{{by whom|date=December 2012}}{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} According to [[Clifford Geertz]], "[b]elieving, with [[Max Weber]], that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning".<ref>{{cite book |last=Geertz |first=Clifford |title=The Interpretation of Cultures |year=1973 |publisher=Basic Books |pages=5}}</ref>

Prominent symbolic anthropologists include [[Clifford Geertz]], [[David M. Schneider|David Schneider]], [[Victor Turner]] and [[Mary Douglas]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
