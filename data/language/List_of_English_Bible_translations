{{EnglishTranslations}}
The [[Bible]] has been [[translation|translated]] into [[Bible translations by language|many languages]] from the [[biblical languages]] of [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]], [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]]. The Latin [[Vulgate]] translation was dominant in [[Western Christianity]] through the Middle Ages. Since then, the Bible has been translated into [[Bible translations by language|many more languages]]. [[English Bible translations]] also have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium.

Included when possible are dates and the source language(s) and, for incomplete translations, what portion of the text has been translated.  Certain terms that occur in many entries are linked at the bottom of the page.

Because different groups of Jews and Christians differ on the true content of the Bible, the "incomplete translations" section includes only translations seen by their translators as incomplete, such as Christian translations of the New Testament alone.  Translations such as Jewish versions of the [[Tanakh]] are included in the "complete" category, even though Christians traditionally have considered the Bible to consist properly of more than just the Tanakh.

| Modern English
| 2006
|
| The RSV-2CE is a slight update of the 1966 Revised Standard Version - Catholic Edition.  It removes archaic pronouns (thee, thou) and accompanying verb forms (didst, speaketh), revises passages used in the lectionary according to the Vatican document Liturgiam authenticam and elevates some passages out of RSV footnotes when they reflect Catholic teaching. For instance, the RSV-2CE renders "almah" as "virgin" in Isaiah 7:14, restores the term "begotten" in John 3:16 and other verses, uses the phrase "full of grace" instead of "favored one" in Luke 1:28, and substitutes "mercy" for "steadfast love" (translated from the Hebrew hesed) throughout the Psalms. As with the original RSV, gender-neutral language is not used when it has no direct referent in original language of the text.
