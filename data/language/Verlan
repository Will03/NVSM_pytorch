'''''Verlan''''' ({{IPA-fr|vɛʁˈlɑ̃}}) is an [[argot]] in the [[French language]], featuring inversion of [[syllable]]s in a word, and is common in [[slang]] and youth language.  It rests on a long French tradition of transposing syllables of individual words to create slang words.<ref name=Lefkowitz>{{cite book |last=Lefkowitz |first=Natalie |title=Talking Backwards, Looking Forwards: The French Language Game Verlan |date=1991 |publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag |isbn=3823340735 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOk9Pldx7i0C}}</ref>{{rp|50}} The name ''verlan'' is an example: it is derived from inverting the sounds of the syllables in ''l'envers'' ({{IPA-fr|lɑ̃ˈvɛʁ|}}, "the inverse", frequently used in the sense of "back-to-front").

== General characteristics and structure ==

===Word formation===
{{Wiktionary category|moredescriptivetext=examples of ''verlan'' words|category=Verlan}}
Words in ''verlan'' are formed by switching the order in which syllables from the original word are pronounced.  For example, ''français'' {{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃ˈsɛ|}} becomes ''céfran'' {{IPA-fr|sefˈʁɑ̃|}}.

''Verlan'' generally retains the pronunciation of the original syllables.  In particular, French words that end in a ''[[e muet|⟨e⟩ muet]]'' (such as ''[[wikt:femme|femme]]'') and words that end in a pronounced consonant and which usually have an ''⟨e⟩ muet'' added at the end (such as ''[[wikt:flic|flic]]'') retain the sound of the ''⟨e⟩ muet'' in ''verlan''. In addition, ''verlan'' often drops the final vowel sound after the word is inverted, so ''femme'' and ''flic'' become ''meuf'' and ''keuf,'' respectively.

Different rules apply for one-syllable words, and words with multiple syllables may be verlanised in more than one way.  For example, ''cigarette'' may yield ''garetsi'' or ''retsiga''.<ref name=Valdman>{{cite journal |last=Valdman |first=Albert |title=La Langue des faubourgs et des banlieues: de l'argot au français populaire |journal=The French Review |volume=73 |issue=6 |year=2000 |language=fr}}</ref>

===Vocabulary===
Some ''verlan'' words, such as ''meuf'', have become so commonplace that they have been included in the ''[[Petit Larousse]]''<ref>See the [[Petit Larousse]] itself. These words are also given on the Larousse website:  [http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/keuf keuf] [http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/meuf meuf] [http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/ripou ripou]</ref> and a doubly "verlanised" version was deemed necessary, so the singly verlanised ''meuf'' became ''feumeu''; similarly, the ''verlan'' word ''[[beur]]'', derived from ''arabe'', has become accepted into popular culture such that it has been re-verlanised to yield ''rebeu''.<ref name=Valdman/><ref name=LefkowitzReview>{{cite journal |title=Verlan: talking backwards in French |first=Natalie J |last= Lefkowitz |journal=[[The French Review]] |volume=63 |issue=2 |year=1989}}</ref>

Some verlan words, which are now well incorporated in common French language, have taken on their own significance, or at least certain connotations that have changed their meaning.<ref name=LefkowitzReview/> For example, the word ''meuf'', which can still be used to refer to any woman, also refers to the speaker's girlfriend, when used in the possessive form (''ma meuf'' → my girl); while the original word ''femme'' would refer to the speaker's wife when used in the same way (''ma femme'' → my wife). Such words retain a cultural significance from the time at which they appeared in common language. Widely spread in the second half of the 20th century, ''beur'' generally refers to first-generation immigrants from northern Africa in France. The re-verlanised word ''rebeu'' is much more recent, and is used to refer rather to second-generation Arab immigrants in France, and their social attitude.{{Check|date=September 2014}}

In theory, any word can be translated into ''verlan'', but only a few expressions are used in everyday speech. Verbs translated into ''verlan'' cannot be conjugated easily. There is no such thing as a ''verlan'' grammar, so generally verbs are used in the infinitive, past participle or [[Imperfect|progressive]] form.  For example:
*''J'étais en train de pécho une bebon''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionnairedelazone.fr/dictionary/definition/bebon |title=Définition de bebon |work=dictionnairedelazone.fr |language=fr}}</ref> ("I was hitting on a hot chick") is said, but not ''je pécho[ais]''.

===Spelling===

The study of written ''verlan'' is difficult as it is primarily passed down orally, without standardized spelling. While some still argue that the letters should be held over from the original word, in the case of ''verlan'', most experts agree that words should be spelled as to [[pronunciation spelling|best approximate pronunciation]].  ''Verlan'' is preferred to ''versl'en''.
The French author [[Auguste Le Breton]] uses numerous examples of ''verlan'', for instance in ''[[Du rififi chez les hommes]]''.

==Cultural significance==

''Verlan'' is less a language than a way to set apart certain words.<ref name=Valdman/> Many verlan words refer either to [[sex]] or [[recreational drug use|drug]]s, related to the original purpose of keeping communication secret from institutions of social control. ''Verlan'' is generally limited to one or two key words per sentence. ''Verlan'' words and expressions are mixed within a more general ''[[argot]]ique'' language.

''Verlan'' is used by people to mark their membership in, or exclusion from, a particular group (generally young people in the cities and ''[[banlieue]]s'', although some French upper-class youth have also started using it as their slang); it is a tool for marking and delineating group identity.<ref name=Valdman/>  Speakers rarely create a ''verlan'' word on the fly; rather, their ability to use and understand words from an accepted set of known ''verlan'' terms allows them to be identified as part of a ''verlan''-speaking group. Lefkowitz claims that the best speakers of the language are often the worst students, those most needing to hide from authority.<ref name=Lefkowitz/>{{rp|61}}

Some ''verlan'' words have gained mainstream currency. Examples of ''verlan'' in cultural mainstream include the 1984 comedy ''Les Ripoux'' (''[[My New Partner]]'') (''ripou'' is verlan for ''pourri'', or rotten, and refers to a corrupt policeman); and the 1977 hit "[[Laisse béton]]" by singer [[Renaud]] (''béton'' is ''verlan'' for ''tomber'' and the phrase means "drop it").

''Verlan'' is popular as a form of expression in [[French hip-hop]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Rosen | first=Jody | date=10 November 2005 | title=David Brooks, Playa Hater | work=[[Slate Magazine]] | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2130120 | accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref>  Artists claim that it fits well with the musical medium because "form ranks way over substance".<ref>{{cite web | last=St. Alse | first=Yaka | date=21 January 2005 | title=Notes to 'Wardsback'  | work=Open Brackets: Lost in Translation | url=http://openbrackets.com/article/640/wardsback | accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref>

The stage name of Belgian pop artist and songwriter [[Stromae]] (real name Paul Van Haver) is ''verlan'' for "[[wikt:maestro#French|maestro]]".<ref>{{cite web | last=Sayare | first=Scott | date=10 October 2013 | title=Stromae: Disillusion, With a Dance Beat  | work=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/arts/15iht-stromae15.html?_r=0}}</ref>

''Voltaire'', the nom-de-plume of [[Voltaire|François-Marie Arouet]], is possibly a ''verlan'' word for [[Airvault]].
