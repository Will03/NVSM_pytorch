'''Noogenesis''' is the emergence and evolution of [[intelligence]].<ref name=wordinfo>[http://wordinfo.info/unit/1410 Noogenesis // Word Info about English Vocabulary]</ref>

== Term origin ==
Noo, [[nous]] ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|n|aʊ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|n|uː|s}}) – from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: νόος|νόος]]}}, has synonyms in other languages {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: 智慧|智慧]]}} ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]), is a term that currently encompasses the semantics: [[mind]], [[intelligence]], [[intellect]], [[reason]]; [[wisdom]]; [[insight]], [[intuition]],  [[thought]], - in a single phenomenon.<ref>{{citation |title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles|edition=3 |page=1417|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref><ref>See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fos νόος]'' in [[Liddell & Scott]], on the [[Perseus Project]].</ref><ref>See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dintellectus2 intellectus]'' in [[Lewis & Short]], on the [[Perseus Project]].</ref>

Noogenesis was first mentioned in the posthumously published in 1955 book ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'' by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], an [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and philosopher, in a few places:
{{quote|"With and within the crisis of reflection, the next term in the series manifests itself. Psychogenesis has led to man. Now it effaces itself, relieved or absorbed by another and a higher function—the engendering and subsequent development of the mind, in one word noogenesis. When for the first time in a living creature instinct perceived itself in its own mirror, the whole world took a pace forward."<ref>[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper & Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 181.</ref> "There is only one way in which our minds can integrate into a coherent picture of noogenesis these two essential properties of the autonomous centre of all centres, and that is to resume and complement our Principle of Emergence."<ref>[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man.

Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper & Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 273.</ref> "To make room for thought in the world, I have needed to ' interiorise ' matter : to imagine an energetics of the mind; to conceive a noogenesis rising upstream against the flow of entropy; to provide evolution with a direction, a line of advance and critical points..."<ref>[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper & Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 290.</ref> —"[[Omega point]]".}}
The lack of any kind of definition of the term has led to a variety of interpretations reflected in the book,<ref>Glycerio, M. L. & Paulsen, J. B. (1999). Is Noogenesis Progressing? Richmond, VA. [http://sites.google.com/site/pellegrinodellavvenire/la-noosfera-e-lo-sviluppo-del-pensiero/teilhard-de-chardin-and-the-formation-of-the-noosphere/from-noosphere-to-fheosphere-cyclotrons-cyberspace-and-teilhard-de-chardin-vision-of-cosmic-love/noosfera-oggi/is-noogenesis-progressing]</ref><ref>Steinhart E.

The most widespread interpretation is thought to be "the emergence of mind, which follows geogenesis, [[biogenesis]] and [[wikt:Hominization|anthropogenesis]], forming a new sphere on [[Earth]]—[[noosphere]]".

A new understanding of the term "noogenesis" as an evolution of the intellect was proposed by A. Eryomin. A hypothesis based on [[recapitulation theory]] links the evolution of the human brain to the development of human civilization. The parallel between the number of people living on Earth and the number of neurons becomes more and more obvious leading us to viewing global intelligence as an analogy for human brain.
All of the people living on this planet have undoubtedly inherited the amazing cultural treasures of the past, be it production, social and intellectual ones. We are genetically hardwired to be a sort of "live RAM" of the global intellectual system. Alexey Eryomin suggests that humanity is moving towards a unified self-contained informational and intellectual system.  His research has shown the probability of Super Intellect realizing itself as Global Intelligence on Earth. We could get closer to understanding the most profound patterns and laws of the Universe if these kinds of research were given enough attention. Also, the resemblance between the individual human development and such of the whole human race has to be explored further if we are to face some of the threats of the future.<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2005/26/67197.html Krivosheev S.

Therefore, generalizing and summarizing: 
{{quote|"Noogenesis—the expansion process in space and development in time (evolution) of intelligent systems (intelligent matter). Noogenesis represents a set of natural, interconnected, characterized by a certain temporal sequence of structural and functional transformations of the entire hierarchy and set of interacting among themselves on the basic structures and processes ranging from the formation and separation of the rational system to the present (the phylogenesis of the nervous systems of organisms; the evolution of humanity as [[autonomy|autonomous]] intelligent systems) or death (in the course of ontogenesis of the human brain)".<ref>Eryomin A.L.

== Aspects of emergence and evolution of mind ==

=== To the parameters of the phenomenon "noo", "intellectus" ===
The emergence of the human mind is considered to be one of the five fundamental phenomenons of [[emergent evolution]].<ref>[https://global.britannica.com/science/emergence-science Emergence. Encyclopædia Britannica. 2017.]</ref> 
To understand the mind, it is necessary to determine how human thinking differs from other thinking beings. Such differences include the ability to generate calculations, to combine dissimilar concepts, to use mental symbols, and to think abstractly.<ref>[http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html Hauser M. The Origin of the Mind // Scientific American. - 2009. September. 301. - P. 44-51.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325141142/http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html |date=2010-03-25 }}</ref>
The knowledge of the phenomenon of intelligent systems—the emergence of reason (noogenesis) boils down to:

* Emergence and evolution of the "[[Homo sapiens|sapiens]]" (phylogenesis);
* A conception of a new idea ([[insight]], [[creativity]] synthesis, [[intuition]], [[decision-making]], [[eureka (word)|eureka]]);
* Development of an individual mind (ontogenesis );
* Appearance of the Global Intelligence concept.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

Several published works which do not employ the term "noogenesis", however, address some patterns in the emergence and functioning of the human intelligence: [[working memory]] capacity  ≥ 7,<ref>Read D.W.
