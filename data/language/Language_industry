The '''language industry''' is the sector of activity dedicated to facilitating multilingual communication, both oral and written. According to the European Commission's Directorate-General of Translation, the language industry comprises the activities of translation, interpreting, subtitling and dubbing, software and website globalisation, language technology tools development, international conference organisation, language teaching and linguistic consultancy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Language industry web platform|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/translation/programmes/languageindustry/platform/index_en.htm|publisher=EC DG Translation|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref> According to the Canadian Language Industry Association, this sector comprises translation (with interpreting, subtitling and localisation), language training and language technologies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our industry|url=http://www.ailia.ca/Our+Industry|publisher=Language Industry Association|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref> The European Language Industry Association limits the sector to translation, localisation, internationalisation and globalisation.<ref>{{cite web|title=ELIA membership application|url=http://www.elia-association.org/index.php?id=101&no_cache=1|publisher=European Language Industry Association|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>  An older, perhaps outdated view confines the language industry to computerised [[language processing]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.btb.gc.ca/btb.php?lang=eng&cont=700#l|title=Glossary - Translation Bureau|publisher=[[Public Works and Government Services Canada]]|accessdate=2009-04-12}}</ref> and places it within the [[information technology industry]]. An emerging view expands this sector to include [[Editing#Editing_services|editing]] for authors who write in a second language—especially English—for international communication.<ref>{{cite book|title=Supporting research writing: roles and challenges in multilingual settings|year=2013|publisher=Chandos|location=Oxford|pages=257–268|last=Matarese|first=Valerie.

The persons who facilitate multilingual communication by offering individualized services—translation, interpreting, editing or language teaching—are called [[language professional]]s.

== Evolution ==
Translation as an activity exists at least since mankind started developing [[trade]] millennia ago; so, if we include [[interpreting]], it is no exaggeration to say that the origins of language industry are older than those of [[written language]].

Modern language industry has developed rapidly following availability of the [[internet]]. Achievements of the industry include the ability to quickly translate long texts into many languages. This has created new challenges as compared with the traditional activity of translators, such as that of [[quality assurance]]. There are various [[Translation-quality standards|quality standards]] such as the  [[International Organization for Standardization]]'s ISO 17100,  [[EN 15038]] in Europe, the CAN CGSB 131.10 in Canada and ASTM F2575-06 in the USA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030122045/|title=BS EN 15038:2006  Translation services. Service requirements|publisher=[[BSI Group]]|accessdate=2009-04-12}}</ref>

A study commissioned by the EC's Directorate-General for Translation estimated the language industry in European member states to be worth 8.4 billion euro in 2008.<ref>{{cite book|title=The size of the language industry in the EU|year=2009|publisher=European Commission DG Translation|isbn=978-92-79-14181-2|url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/EU-Bookshop-Site/en_GB/-/EUR/ViewPublication-Start?PublicationKey=HC8009985}}</ref>  The largest portion, 5.7 billion euro, was ascribed to the activities of translation, interpreting, software localisation and website globalisation. Editing was not taken into consideration. The study projected an annual growth rate of 10% for the language industry. At the time the study was published, in 2009, the language industry was less affected by the economic crisis than other industry sectors. 

One field of research in the industry includes the possibility of [[machine translation]] fully replacing human translation.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of TMI|last=Paul |first=Michael |author2=Andrew Finch |author3=Eiichiro Sumita  |title=Reducing human assessment of machine translation quality to binary classifiers|year=2007|pages=154–162|url=http://www.mt-archive.info/TMI-2007-Paul.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-12}}</ref>

==Controversies==
Rates for translation services have become a big discussion topic nowadays{{when?|date=January 2014}},<ref>

Apart from this, phenomena such as [[crowdsourcing]] appear in large-scale translations.<ref>
