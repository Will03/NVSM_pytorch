__NOTOC__
'''Yinglish''' words (also referred to colloquially as '''Hebronics''') are [[neologism]]s created by speakers of [[Yiddish]] in [[English-speaking countries]], sometimes to describe things that were uncommon in the old country. [[Leo Rosten]]'s book ''[[The Joys of Yiddish]]''<ref>{{harvp|Rosten|1970}}</ref> uses the words ''Yinglish'' and ''Ameridish'' to describe new words, or new meanings of existing Yiddish words, created by English-speaking persons with some knowledge of Yiddish. Rosten defines "Yinglish" as "Yiddish words that are used in colloquial English" (such as ''kibitzer)''<ref>{{harvp|Rosten|1970|p=ix}}</ref> and Ameridish as words coined by Jews in the United States;<ref>{{harvp|Rosten|1970|p=x}}</ref> his use, however, is sometimes inconsistent. According to his definition on page x, ''alrightnik'' is an Ameridish word; however, on page 12 it is identified as Yinglish.

''The Joys of Yiddish'' describes the following words as Yinglish except where noted as Ameridish:

* '''alrightnik''', '''alrightnikeh''', '''alrightnitseh'''&nbsp;– male, female, female individual who has been successful; ''nouveau riche''<ref>{{harvp|Rosten|1970|p=12}}</ref>
* '''bleib shver''' &nbsp;– from German ''bleibt schwer'', meaning ''remains difficult'' - unresolved problem, especially in [[Talmud]] learning (cf. [[wikt:תיקו]])
* '''[[blintz]]''' (Yinglish because the true Yiddish is ''blintzeh'')<ref>{{harvp|Rosten|1970|p=42}}</ref>
* '''bluffer''', '''blufferkeh'''&nbsp;– male, female person who bluffs<ref>{{harvp|Rosten|1970|p=43}}</ref>
* '''boarderkeh''', '''bordekeh'''&nbsp;– (Ameridish) female paying boarder<ref>{{harvp|Rosten|1970|p=44}}</ref>
* '''boychick''', '''boychikel''', '''boychiklekh''' – young boy, kiddo, handsome<ref>{{harvp|Rosten|1970|p=49}}</ref>
* '''bulbenik''' (Ameridish)&nbsp;– an actor who muffs his lines, from ''bilbul'' - mixup (alternative theory - ''bulba'', literally ''potato'', figuratively ''error'')<ref>{{harvp|Rosten|1970|p=56}}</ref>
* '''bummerkeh''' (Ameridish)&nbsp;– a female bum
* '''chutzpah''' (Ameridish)&nbsp;– audacity
* '''cockamamy''' false, ersatz, crazy (of an idea), artificial, jury-rigged (prob. from Eng. "decalcomania," a "decal," a sticker, a cheap process for transferring images from paper to glass.)
