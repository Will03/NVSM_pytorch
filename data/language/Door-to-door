'''Door-to-door''' is a [[canvassing]] technique that is generally used for [[sales]], [[marketing]], [[advertising]], or [[Political campaign|campaigning]], in which the person or persons walk from the door of one house to the door of another, trying to sell or advertise a product or service to the general public or [[Information gathering|gather information]]. People who use this sales approach are often called traveling salesmen, or the [[Archaism|archaic]] name drummer, to "drum up" business. This technique is also sometimes called direct sales. A variant of this involves [[cold calling]] first, when another sales representative attempts to gain agreement that a salesperson should visit.

==Model==
Products or services sold door-to-door are generally in one of seven industries: cable, telecommunications, solar, energy, security, landscaping and construction.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2016/10/door-door-solar-sales-back/|title=Door-to-door solar sales is back—but why?|date=2016-10-04|work=Solar Power World|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US}}</ref> There are also many multi-level marketing products sold door-to-door.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlmlaw.com/library/guides/dortodor.htm|title=MLM Law -  Door-to-Door Sales- Attorney Specializing in Multilevel Marketing and Direct Selling Reese, Poyfair, Richards|website=www.mlmlaw.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-07}}</ref> The industries accounting for the largest share of direct-sales revenue include construction and telecommunications.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3403859/ns/business-us_business/t/revival-door-to-door-marketing/#.WgIp7BOPIWo|title=A revival for door-to-door marketing|date=2003-11-12|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}</ref> The largest subset of these would be the home improvement products/services where items sold could be new or repaired roofs, [[siding]], new replacement windows, and decorative stone. {{As of|2008}} the [[business model]] of many companies that participate in this type of [[direct marketing]] has changed with the growth of the [[Information Age]]. Products sold door-to-door are now more likely to be more subtle in nature: such as sheets of [[coupon]]s to events or local businesses, [[season ticket]]s to local professional sports teams (both of these are known in the industry as "Cert [or certificate] Sales", or subscriptions to home [[Pay television|television services]] or [[Broadband Internet access|broadband internet]] services. [[Telecommunications]] companies like [[Verizon Communications]] ([[Verizon FiOS|FiOS]]), Comcast (Cable [[cable television|television]] and [[Cable Internet|internet]]) and [[AT&T]] ([[U-verse]]) all contract with various marketing companies for nationwide sales fulfillment at the residential level. While the practice of the salesman carrying a bag of goods on his shoulder to sell to the public declined with advances made in technology and internet selling, there has been a resurgence of door-to-door selling in recent years, especially in the energy and solar industries ([[SolarCity]]) ([[Vivint Solar Inc.]]).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sweet|first1=Cassandra|title=SolarCity Aims to Cut Marketing Costs as Competition Heats Up|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/solarcity-aims-to-cut-marketing-costs-as-competition-heats-up-1474563276|website=The Wall Street Journal (wsj.com)|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2017-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Door-todoor Sales: The Forgotten Channel|url=https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/consumer_products_retail_door_to_door_sales/|publisher=Boston Consulting Group}}</ref>

==Banning and regulation==
In the [[United States]], some communities attempted to criminalize this form of selling by passing what is known as a [[Green River Ordinance]] which bans all door-to-door sales.  In 1933, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld such a law valid <ref>Town of Green River v. Fuller Brush Co. (1933) 65 F.2d 112</ref> but in 1976 the Supreme Court extended the First Amendment to commercial speech<ref>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. (1976) 425 U.S. 748 (96 S.Ct. 1817)</ref> and in 1980 set forth a four-pronged test regarding the regulation of door-to-door selling:<ref>Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp v. Public Service Comm. (1980) 447 U.S. 557, (100 S.Ct. 2343)</ref>

# The pitch itself must not regard things that are in themselves illegal and must be truthful to be protected by the First Amendment.<ref>Edenfield v. Fane: Project 80’s Inc. v. Cit of Pocatello (1988) 876 F.2d 711.</ref>
# Assertive governmental interest is substantial.
# The regulation directly advances point 2.
# If the regulation is necessary to serve that interest (i.e. demonstrating “no solicitation” signs and already existing trespass laws are not sufficient).

If a regulation meets these criteria, it is most likely legal.

New technologies have also changed door-to-door sales' efficacy and appeal for organizations. Expansive databases of American households pull together demographic information, consumer data, and past-canvassing profiles to allow precise targeting of potential buyers. Corporations no longer knock on all the doors in an area, instead they focus on people most likely to buy their products or services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.polisapp.com/dnv-gl-webinar|title=DNV GL Webinar|website=Polisapp.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-07}}</ref>
