Today it is nearly extinct, and fewer than 100 people still speak it.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2015/01/17/377734363/do-you-harp-a-slib-of-the-ling-one-small-towns-opaque-language Stina Sieg, "Do You Harp A Slib Of The Ling?

==History and description==
Although based on English, many of Boontling's unusual words are unique to [[Boonville, California|Boonville]], California.  [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], and some [[Pomoan languages|Pomoan]] and Spanish words also contribute to this jargon.<ref>Haddock, Vicki. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/05/MN158281.DTL "Hamlet's Dying Lingo"] in ''San Francisco Chronicle'', February 5, 2001.</ref>  Boontling was invented in the late nineteenth century and had quite a following at the turn of the twentieth century.  It is now mostly spoken by aging counter-culturists and native [[Anderson Valley]] residents.  Because the town of Boonville only has a little over 700 residents, Boontling is an extremely esoteric jargon, and is quickly becoming archaic.  It has over a thousand unique words and phrases.

===Origins===
The Anderson Valley, of which Boonville is the largest town, was an isolated farming, ranching, and logging community during the late nineteenth century. There are several differing versions as to the origin of Boontling. Some assert that the jargon was created by the women, children, and young men in the hop fields and sheep shearing sheds as a means of recreation, and that it spread through the community as the children continued using it when they grew up.<ref name="A Little Boont">[http://www.andersonvalleymuseum.org/boontling.html ''A Little Boont''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409032302/http://www.andersonvalleymuseum.org/boontling.html |date=April 9, 2007 }} at the Anderson Valley Museum</ref> Myrtle R. Rawles explains that Boontling was started by the children of Boonville as a language game which enabled them to speak freely in front of elders without being understood.<ref>Rawles, Myrtle R. (1967); ''Boontling: The Strange Boonville Language''. Mendocino Historical Society, p.3</ref> It is believed that the jargon originated from Ed (Squirrel) Clement and Lank McGimsey, circa 1890.

===Documentation===
Based on interviews of family and neighbors, Rawles wrote an article, "'Boontling': Esoteric Speech of Boonville, California," published in 1966 by the California Folklore Society (presently Western States Folklore Society) in ''Western Folklore'', Volume 25, No. 2, and reprinted under the title ''Boontling, or the strange Boonville language'' by the Mendocino County Historical Society in 1967.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007FTRGQ ''Boontling, or the strange Boonville language''] at Amazon.com</ref>
Researcher Charles C. Adams studied the lingo in the 1960s and wrote a doctoral dissertation based on his research. In 1971 [[University of Texas Press]] published his book, ''Boontling: an American Lingo'', which included an extensive dictionary.<ref>"Hamlet's Dying Lingo" in ''San Francisco Chronicle''</ref> Boontling briefly enjoyed a national audience in the mid-1970s when a Boontling speaker named Bobby (Chipmunk) Glover was a regular guest on the well-known ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on the [[NBC]] television network. Boontling historian Jack (Wee Fuzz) June appeared on the game show ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' and was so well known by this point that panelist [[Kitty Carlisle]] had to disqualify herself from the judging.
Because Boontling is a spoken jargon rather than a written one, spellings of its words vary greatly. Most spellings were not formalized until the 1970s, primarily by the writings of Jack (Wee Fuzz) June.
