'''Toponymy''' is the study of place names ([[wikt:toponym|toponyms]]), their origins, meanings, use, and [[wiktionary:typology|typology]].<ref>{{cite book |first=F.J. |last=Ormeling Sr. |chapter=Terms used in geographical names standardization |editor-first=T.R. |editor-last=Tichelaar |title=Proceedings of the Workshop on Toponymy held in Cipanas, Indonesia |date=16-18 October 1989 |location=Cibinong |publisher=Bakosurtanal}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word "toponymy" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''tópos'' (τόπος) "place" and ''ónoma'' (ὄνομα) "name". Toponymy is itself a branch of  [[onomastics]], the study of names of all kinds.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Approaches to Research in Toponymy |first=Jan |last=Tent |pages=65-74 |date=29 April 2015 |doi=10.1179/0027773814Z.000000000103 |volume=63 |issue=2 |journal=[[Names (journal)|Names]] |publisher=[[Tandfonline]]}}</ref>

==Meaning and history==
''Toponym'' is the general name for any place or geographical entity.<ref>''United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names, London, 10–31 May 1972.'' 1974. New York: United Nations. Dept. of Economic and Social Affairs, p. 68.</ref> Related, more specific types of toponym include ''[[Hydronymy|hydronym]]'' for a body of water and ''oronym'' for a mountain or hill. A ''toponymist'' is one who studies toponymy.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word "toponymy" first appeared in English in 1876; since then, toponym has come to replace "place-name" in professional discourse among [[geographer]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} It can be argued that the first toponymists were the storytellers and poets who explained the origin of specific place names as part of their tales; sometimes place-names served as the basis for the [[etiology|etiological]] legends. The process of [[folk etymology]] usually took over, whereby a false meaning was extracted from a name based on its structure or sounds. Thus, the toponym of [[Hellespont]] was explained by Greek poets as being named after [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], daughter of [[Athamas]], who drowned there as she crossed it with her brother [[Phrixus]] on a flying golden ram. The name, however, is probably derived from an older language, such as [[Pelasgian]], which was unknown to those who explained its origin. [[George R. Stewart]] theorized, in his book ''Names on the Globe'', that ''Hellespont'' originally meant something like "narrow Pontus" or "entrance to Pontus", "Pontus" being an ancient name for the region around the [[Black Sea]], and by extension, for the sea itself.<ref>{{cite book | last = Stewart | first = George Rippey | date=7 August 1975| title = Names on the Globe | publisher =  Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-501895-0  |edition= 1st | pages =  }}</ref>

Place names provide the most useful geographical reference system in the world. Consistency and accuracy are essential in referring to a place to prevent confusion in everyday business and recreation. A toponymist, through well-established local principles and procedures developed in cooperation and consultation with the [[United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names]] (UNGEGN), applies the science of toponymy to establish officially recognized geographical names. A toponymist relies not only on maps and local histories, but interviews with local residents to determine names with established local usage. The exact application of a toponym, its specific language, its pronunciation, and its origins and meaning are all important facts to be recorded during name surveys.

Scholars have found that toponyms provide valuable insight into the historical geography of a particular region. In 1954 [[F. M. Powicke]] said of place-name study that it "uses, enriches and tests the discoveries of archaeology and history and the rules of the [[Philology|philologists]]".<ref>Powicke, reviewing Armstrong, Mawer, Stenton and Dickins ''The Place-Names of Cumberland'' (1950–53) in ''The English Historical Review'' '''69'''  (April 1954), p 312.</ref> Toponyms not only illustrate ethnic settlement patterns, but they can also help identify discrete periods of immigration.<ref>{{cite journal | last = McDavid | first = R.I. | year = 1958 | title = Linguistic Geographic and Toponymic Research | journal = Names | issue = 6 | pages = 65–73 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Kaups | first = M. | year = 1966 | title = Finnish Place Names in Minnesota: A Study in Cultural Transfer | journal = The Geographical Review| issue = 56 | pages = 377–397 | doi = 10.2307/212463 | volume = 56 | publisher = Geographical Review, Vol. 56, No. 3 | jstor = 212463 }}</ref><ref>Kharusi, N. S. & Salman, A. (2011) The English Transliteration of Place Names in Oman. Journal of Academic and Applied Studies Vol. 1(3) September 2011, pp. 1–27 Available online at www.academians.org</ref>

Toponymists are responsible for the active preservation of their region's culture through its toponymy. They typically ensure the ongoing development of a geographical names data base and associated publications, for recording and disseminating authoritative hard-copy and digital toponymic data. This data may be disseminated in a wide variety of formats, including hard-copy topographic maps as well as digital formats such as [[geographic information system]]s and [[Google Maps]].

==Issues==
In 2002, the [[United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names]] acknowledged that while common, the practice of naming geographical places after living persons could be problematic. As such, the [[United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names]] recommends that it be avoided and that national authorities should set their own guidelines as to the time required after a person's death for the use of a commemorative name.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=oxVSKQ6bv2AC&lpg=PA75&ots=HYsuggZiAT&dq=E%2FCONF.94%2F3&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=living%20person&f=false |title=Eighth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names |date=2002 |website=United Nations. Department of Economic and Social Affairs |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>

In the same vein, authors Pinchevski and Torgovnik considers the naming of streets as a political act in which holders of the legitimate monopoly to name aspire to engrave their ideological views in the social space.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pinchevski |first=Amit  |last2=Torgovnik |first2=Efraim |date=May 2002 |title=Signifying passages: the signs of change in Israeli street names |url= |journal=Media, Culture & Society |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1177/016344370202400305 |access-date=}}</ref> Similarly, the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] practice of
[[Street or road name#Street renaming|renaming streets]], as both the celebration of triumph and the repudiation of the old regime is another issue of toponymy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Azaryahu |first1=Maoz |date=2009 |title=Critical Toponymies: The Contested Politics of Place Naming |trans-title= |chapter= Naming the past: The significance of commemorative street names|url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=xg1GAepFft8C&lpg=PA227&dq=toponymy%20ideology&pg=PA56#v=snippet&q=%22naming%20the%20past%22&f=false|language= |location= |publisher=Routledge  |isbn= |subscription= |quote= }}</ref>  Also, in the context of [[Russian nationalism|Slavic nationalism]], the name of [[Saint Petersburg]] was changed to the more Slavic sounding ''Petrograd'' from 1914 to 1924,<ref>{{cite book |last1= Lincoln |first1=Bruce |date=2000 |title= Sunlight at Midnight: St. Petersburg and the Rise of Modern Russia|trans-title=|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jPMM7Abnk6EC&lpg=PA219&ots=IzWqgHkIh5&dq=petrograd%20slavic%20nationalism&pg=PA219#v=onepage&q=petrograd%20slavic%20nationalism&f=false |language= |location= |publisher=Basic Books |isbn= |subscription= |quote= }}</ref> then to ''Leningrad'' following the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and back to ''Saint-Peterburg'' in 1991  after the fall of the Soviet Union. After 1830, in the wake of the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the establishment of an independent Greece, Turkish, Slavic and Italian place names were Hellenized, as an effort of "toponymic cleansing". This nationalization of place names can also manifest itself in a [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] context.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Rose-Redwood |first=Reuben |date=2009 |title=Geographies of toponymic inscription: new directions in critical place-name studies |url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Reuben_Rose-Redwood/publication/249872329_Geographies_of_toponymic_inscription_New_directions_in_critical_place-name_studies/links/53fb7bc10cf2364ccc03f389.pdf|journal=Progress in Human Geography |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |page= 460 |doi= |access-date=|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Frictions sometimes arise between countries because of toponymy, as illustrated by the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] in which [[Greece]] has claimed the name ''Macedonia'', as well as the [[Persian Gulf naming dispute]]. Over the years, it has also been noted that a map producer used the name [[Persian Gulf]] in a 1977 map of [[Iran]] while retaining "''Arabian Gulf''" in another 1977 map focusing on the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], underlying the occasional spilling of place names issues into the economic sphere.<ref>{{cite journal |date=2004 |title= Toponymy and Geopolitics: The Political Use — and Misuse — of Geographical Names|url=http://www.iwp.edu/docLib/20131022_KadmonToponomyandGeopolitics.pdf |journal=The Cartographic Journal |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= 10.1179/000870404X12897|access-date=}}</ref>
