The village is located across the Qudiyalçay River (or Kudyal River) from the larger town of [[Quba]]. It is the primary settlement of Azerbaijan's population of highland, or [[mountain Jews]] who make up the population of approximately 4,000.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=oZCOAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA124|title=Ethnic Groups of North, East, and Central Asia: An Encyclopedia|first=James B.|last= Minahan|year=2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1610690184|page=124}}</ref> The most widely spoken language in Qırmızı Qəsəbə is [[Juhuri]].

The settlement is sometimes referred to as the Red Town or the Red Village, possibly because of the red tiling used on many of the roofs.<ref name=css/> Other sources attribute the name to the protected status the town received during the Soviet period, when it was shielded from persecution during World War II.<ref name=atlasob/>

== Geography ==
Initially spread throughout the mountainous region, the Jewish population of the highlands became centered around Qaba.<ref name=atlasob>{{cite web|title=Krasnaya Sloboda (Qırmızı QƏsƏbƏ)|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/krasnaya-sloboda-qirmizi-q-s-b|website=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> The settlement is sometimes referred to as the Red Town or the Red Village, possibly because of the red tiling used on many of the roofs.<ref name=css/>

=== Quba ===
{{Main|Quba}}

Quba is one of the popular regions of Azerbaijan. In the past, the guests visiting Azerbaijan were invited to visit Quba because of its proximity to the capital city. [[Lezgins]], [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tats]], [[Khinalug people]], [[Budukh people]] and [[Kryts people]] were living in peace and friendship with Turks in Quba for centuries. Qırmızı, being located in Quba where the mountain Jews reside, is also important in promoting Quba.<ref name=azerb>{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerb.com/az-krasnaya.html|title=Krasnaya Sloboda|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Quba-Azerbaijan|title=Quba|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

===Demographics===
Officially, Jews were registered with 213,138 people in 34 settlements of the Caucasus in 1881. Over the past hundred years, along with highland Jews, other ethnolinguistic groups or the regions - Ashkenazi, Krymchaks, Kurdish Jews, and Georgian Jews also lived in Azerbaijan. However, since the 19th century, the majority of Jewish population of republic is consisting of mountainous Jews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.azernews.az/travel/67543.html|title=Krasnaya Sloboda – unique settlement of Jews in Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/azerbaijan-virtual-jewish-history-tour|title=Azerbaijan Virtual Jewish History Tour|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Synagogue at Qırmızı Qəsəbə.jpg|thumb|left|Inside a renovated "Giləki" (Hilaki) Synagogue<ref name="Qırmızı qəsəbə Giləki sinaqoqu">{{cite web|title=Qırmızı qəsəbə "Giləki" sinaqoqu|url=http://scwra.gov.az/structure/20/?Q%C4%B1rm%C4%B1z%C4%B1%20q%C9%99s%C9%99b%C9%99%20%E2%80%9CGil%C9%99ki%E2%80%9D%20sinaqoqu|website=scwra.gov.az|accessdate=12 April 2017|language=en}}</ref>]]

The first Jewish settlement in the area was named "Kulgat" on the left bank of the Gudjalchay, just a few kilometers from present day Qırmızı. The old grave stones in the Kulgat area and other evidences that partially had been destroyed during the attacks of the Nadir Shah proves that the Jews had lived here.

While the highland Jews had been in the area around Quba since at least the 13th century, the formal creation of Krasnaya Sloboda is traced back to the 18th century. In 1742 the Khan of Quba, [[Fatali Khan]], gave the Jews permission to set up a community free of persecution across the river from the city of Quba.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Jerusalem of the Caucasus|journal=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/386/ad48cd0/|accessdate=9 March 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Originally referred to as Yevreiskaya ''[[Sloboda]]'' (Jewish Settlement), the name was changed to Krasnaya Sloboda (Red Settlement) under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule.

The Jews who moved here from different places lived in 9 settlements. The Jews from Gilan moved to the settlement in the 1780. The Gilaki settlement of the Gilani Jews located in the center of the Red settlement. People coming from [[Baku]] and Quba lived in the settlement of Mizrahi ("East"). Migration from different locations influenced the diversity of employment. For example, Jews moving from mountainous regions were engaged in various agricultural fields, and people who immigrated from Iran were engaged in trade.

The massive settlement in the Red town began in 1731. After the death of Huseynali Khan in 1758, his son Fatali Khan was leader of Quba khanate. Khan highly appreciating the loyalty, wisdom, and industriousness of the mountain Jews, gave them a great opportunity for engaging in agriculture, gardening, trade, and crafts. Favorable living conditions created for Jews in Quba caused the relocation of Jews from other villages, such as [[Qusar District|Qusar]], [[Uçgün|Ucgun]], [[Şuduq|Shudukh]], Griz, and even from [[Baku]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and other places to Quba.

Finally, mountain Jews who escaped attacks and persecutions joined the shelter of heading Husseinanli Khan in Quba. The Quba Khanate, which were developing during the years of Hussein Khan (1722-1758) and his son Fatali Khan (1758-1789), consist of the northern lands of Azerbaijan and southern [[Dagestan]], from [[Derbent]] to [[Lankaran District|Lankaran]]. Since 1722, mountain Jews have settled in the territory of Gudyalchay.<ref name=azerb/>

Among Russian Jews, the town once was known as "little Jerusalem".<ref>{{cite web|title=Jewish shtetl in Azerbaijan survives amid Muslim majority|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-shtetl-in-azerbaijan-survives-amid-muslim-majority/|website=The Times of Israel}}</ref> Located at the intersection of East and West, more than 40 minorities and ethnic groups live in [[Azerbaijan]], including [[Talyshs]], [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]], [[Lezgins]], [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Georgians]], [[Poles]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/112/504c92fb/|title=JEWS IN AZERBAIJAN: A HISTORY SPANNING THREE MILLENNIA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

The town has had an influx of financial support from relatives living in [[Israel]] and features the new Bet Knesset Synagogue.<ref>{{cite web|title=It's an all-Jewish town, but no, it's not in Israel|url=https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/it-s-an-all-jewish-town-but-no-it-s-not-in-israel-1.25044|website=www.thejc.com}}</ref> However, after Azerbaijan's independence in 1991, many residents emigrated to [[Israel]], the [[United States]], and [[Europe]], and the population dropped from the roughly 18,000 that lived there during the era of Communism.<ref>{{cite web|title=JOURNEY INTO THE UNREAL|url=http://www.shalom-magazine.com/Article.php?id=470309|website=www.shalom-magazine.com|publisher=SHALOM}}</ref>

== Religious practice ==
The Jewish residents continue their worship in the remaining synagogues. Only eight of the thirteen synagogues have been preserved in the settlement.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Two synagogues exist in Qırmızı Qəsəbə: "Altı günbəz" (Grand) synagogue which was built in 1888 and renovated in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|title=Qırmızı qəsəbə "Altı günbəz" sinaqoqu|url=http://scwra.gov.az/structure/21/?Q%C4%B1rm%C4%B1z%C4%B1%20q%C9%99s%C9%99b%C9%99%20%E2%80%9CAlt%C4%B1%20g%C3%BCnb%C9%99z%E2%80%9D%20sinaqoqu|website=scwra.gov.az|accessdate=12 April 2017|language=en}}</ref> and "Giləki" (Hilaki) synagogue which was built in 1896 and renovated recently.<ref name="Qırmızı qəsəbə Giləki sinaqoqu"/>

Synagogues do not have a special call during worship. People come and pray because they know the time of worship. Morning worship begins at 8am. The afternoon worship comes at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. and at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. evening worship. Following tradition, women do not worship in the synagogue though may come to synagogues on holidays.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Residents speak in 3 language: [[Judeo-Tat]] which mountain Jews speak in daily life, Russian and Azerbaijan language. The majority of residents of this settlement have also mastered English. One of the two schools here is taught in Azerbaijani or Russian.<ref name=css>{{Cite web|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/articles/article.html/52398/pdf|title=Azerbaijan’s Jewish enclave|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>
