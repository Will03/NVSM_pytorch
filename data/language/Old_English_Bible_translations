The '''Old English Bible translations''' are the partial [[Bible translation|translations of the Bible]] prepared in medieval [[England]] into the [[Old English language]]. The translations are from Latin texts, not the original languages.

Many of these translations were in fact [[Bible gloss]]es, prepared to assist [[cleric]]s whose grasp of [[Latin]] was imperfect and circulated in connection with the [[Vulgate|Vulgate Latin Bible]] that was standard in [[Western Christianity]] at the time.  Old English was one of very few early medieval vernacular languages the Bible was translated into,{{sfn|Stanton|2002|p=101|ps=: "There was very little translation of the Bible into any Western vernacular in the Middle Ages, and as with other kinds of texts, English was precocious in this regard. The portions of the Bible translated into Old English are among the earliest vernacular versions of the Latin Bible in Western Europe"}} and featured a number of incomplete [[Bible]] translations, some of which were meant, like the Paris Psalter<ref>MS fonds latin 8824, not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Paris Psalter]]</ref> or Ælfric's Hexateuch, to be circulated.{{sfn|Stanton|2002|p=126, 162}}

== Early history (600-874) ==
Information about translations is limited before the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664. [[Aldhelm]], [[Bishop of Sherborne]] and [[Abbot of Malmesbury]] (639–709), is thought to have written an Old English translation of the [[Psalms]], although this is disputed.{{according to whom|date=March 2015}}

[[Cædmon]] (~657–684) is mentioned by Bede as one who sang poems in Old English based on the Bible stories, but he was not involved in translation per se.

[[Bede]] (c. 672–735) produced a translation of the [[Gospel of John]] into Old English, which he is said to have prepared shortly before his death.  This translation is lost; we know of its existence from Cuthbert of Jarrow's account of Bede's death.{{sfn|Dobbie|1937}}

The ''[[Vespasian Psalter]]''{{sfn|Wright|1967}} (~850–875) is an [[interlinear gloss]] of the [[Book of Psalms]] in the [[Mercian dialect]].<ref>See also {{harvnb|Roberts|2011}}, which looks at three Anglo-Saxon glossed psalters and how layers of gloss and text, language and layout, speak to the meditative reader.</ref>  Eleven other Anglo-Saxon (and two later) [[psalter]]s with Old English glosses are known.{{sfn|Roberts|2011|p=74|ps=, n. 5}}{{sfn|Gretsch|2000|p=85–87}} The earliest are probably the early-9th-century red glosses of the [[Blickling Psalter]] ([[Pierpont Morgan Library]], M.776).{{sfn|Roberts|2011|p=61}}{{sfn|McGowan|2007|p=205}} The latest Old English gloss is contained in the 12th-century [[Eadwine Psalter]].{{sfn|Harsley|1889}}  The Old English material in the [[Tiberius Psalter]] of around 1050 includes a continuous interlinear gloss of the psalms.

== Alfred and the House of Wessex (875-999) ==
As England was consolidated under the [[House of Wessex]], led by descendants of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Edward the Elder]], translations continued. King Alfred (849–899) circulated a number of passages of the Bible in the vernacular. These included passages from the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Pentateuch]], which he prefixed to a code of laws he promulgated around this time.  Alfred is also said to have directed the Book of Psalms to have been translated into Old English, though scholars are divided on Alfredian authorship of the Paris Psalter collection of the first fifty Psalms.{{sfn|Colgrave|1958}}{{sfn|Treschow|Gill|Swartz|2012|ps=, §19ff}}

Between 950 and 970, [[Aldred the Scribe]] added a gloss in the [[Northumbrian dialect]] of Old English (the ''Northumbrian Gloss on the Gospels'') to the ''[[Lindisfarne Gospels]]'' as well as a foreword describing who wrote and decorated it. Its version of The [[Lord's Prayer]] is as follows:
::''Suae ðonne iuih gie bidde fader urer ðu arð ðu bist in heofnum & in heofnas; sie gehalgad noma ðin; to-cymeð ric ðin. sie willo ðin suae is in heofne & in eorðo. hlaf userne oferwistlic sel us to dæg. & forgef us scylda usra suae uoe forgefon scyldgum usum. & ne inlæd usih in costunge ah gefrig usich from yfle''

At around the same time (~950–970), a priest named Farman wrote a gloss on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] that is preserved in a manuscript called the ''[[Rushworth Gospels]]''.{{sfn|Stevenson|Waring|1854–1865}}

In approximately 990, a full and freestanding version of the four Gospels in idiomatic Old English appeared in the [[West Saxon dialect]] and are known as the ''[[Wessex Gospels]]''.  Seven manuscript copies of this translation have survived. This translation gives us the most familiar Old English version of {{Bibleref|Matthew|6:9–13}}, the [[Lord's Prayer]]:
::''Fæder ure þu þe eart on heofonum, si þin nama gehalgod. To becume þin rice, gewurþe ðin willa, on eorðan swa swa on heofonum.  Urne gedæghwamlican hlaf syle us todæg, and forgyf us ure gyltas, swa swa we forgyfað urum gyltendum.  And ne gelæd þu us on costnunge, ac alys us of yfele. Soþlice.''

At about the same time as the Wessex Gospels (~990), the priest [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] produced an independent translation of the [[Pentateuch]] with books of [[Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]]. His translations were used for the illustrated [[Old English Hexateuch]].

== Late Anglo-Saxon translations (after 1000) ==
The [[Cædmon manuscript|Junius manuscript]] (initially ascribed to Cædmon) was copied about 1000. It includes Biblical material in vernacular verses: Genesis in two versions (''[[Genesis A]]'' and ''[[Genesis B]]''), ''[[Exodus (poem)|Exodus]]'', ''[[Daniel (Old English poem)|Daniel]]'', and ''[[Christ and Satan]]'', from the apocryphal [[Gospel of Nicodemus]].

The three related manuscripts, [[Royal 1 A. xiv]] at the British Library, [[Bodley 441]] and [[Hatton gospels|Hatton 38]] at the Bodleian Library, are written in Old English, although produced in the late 12th century. Hatton 38 is noted as being written in the latest Kentish form of West Saxon.{{sfn|MS. Hatton 38|2011|ps=, [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/medieval/hatton/images/aaq0196.gif vol. 2, pt. 2, p. 837]}} They cover the four Gospels, with one section (Luke 16.14–17.1) missing from both manuscripts, Hatton and Royal.{{sfn|Kato|2013}}

In 1066, the [[Norman Conquest of England]] marked the beginning of the end of the Old English language. Translating the Bible into Old English gradually ended with the movement from Old English to [[Middle English]], and eventually there were attempts to provide [[Middle English Bible translations]].
