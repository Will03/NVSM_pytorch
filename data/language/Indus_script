The '''Indus script''' (also known as the '''Harappan script''') is a corpus of symbols produced by the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] during the [[Kot Diji]] and [[Mature Harappan]] periods between 3500 and 1900 BCE. Most inscriptions containing these symbols are extremely short, making it difficult to judge whether or not these symbols constituted a [[Writing system|script]] used to record a language, or even symbolise a [[writing system]].<ref name="Locklear">{{cite web |first1=Mallory |last1=Locklear |quote="After a century of failing to crack an ancient script, linguists turn to machines." |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14371450/indus-valley-civilization-ancient-seals-symbols-language-algorithms-ai |title=Science: Machine learning could finally crack the 4,000-year-old Indus script |work=[[The Verge]] |location=Manhattan, New York, NY |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}</ref> In spite of many attempts,<ref>(Possehl, 1996)</ref> ‘the script’ has not yet been deciphered, but efforts are ongoing.

The first publication of a seal with Harappan symbols dates to 1875, in a drawing by [[Alexander Cunningham]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cunningham|first1=Alexander|title=Harappa|journal=Archaeological Survey of India: Report for the Years 1872-3|date=1875|volume=5|pages=105–108}}</ref> Since then, over 4,000 inscribed objects have been discovered, some as far afield as [[Mesopotamia]]. In the early 1970s, [[Iravatham Mahadevan]] published a [[text corpus|corpus]] and [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] of Indus inscriptions listing 3,700 seals and 417 distinct signs in specific patterns. He also found that the average inscription contained five symbols and that the longest inscription contained only 14 symbols in a single line.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-civilization-cracking-the-indus-script-1.18587 Ancient civilization_ Cracking the Indus script _ Nature News & Comment]</ref>

Another possibility for continuity of the Indus tradition is in the [[Megalithic Graffiti Symbols|megalithic culture graffiti symbols]] of southern and central India (and [[Sri Lanka]]), which probably do not constitute a linguistic script but may have some overlap with the Indus symbol inventory.

In Tamil Nadu, a broken potsherd was found in Marungur which had Tamil-Brahmi and Indus engravings.
<ref>http://www.ttamil.com/2018/02/story-or-history-of-writingpart20.html?m=1 </ref>
This shows that Indus script and Brahmi script have co-existed before Indus script was lost.

==Corpus==
Early examples of the symbol system are found in an [[Early Harappan]] and [[Indus valley civilisation|Indus civilisation]] context, dated to possibly as early as the 35th century BCE.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

===Late Harappan===
After 1900 BCE, the systematic use of the symbols ended, after the final stage of the Mature Harappan civilization. A few Harappan signs have been claimed to appear until as late as around 1100 BCE, the beginning of the [[Iron Age in India]]. Onshore explorations near [[Bet Dwarka]] in [[Gujarat]] revealed the presence of late Indus seals depicting a three-headed animal, an earthen vessel inscribed in what is claimed to be a late Harappan script and a large quantity of pottery. The [[thermoluminescence dating|thermoluminescence date]] for the pottery is 1528 BCE. That evidence has been used to claim that a late Harappan script was used until around 1500 BCE.<ref>Sullivan, S. M. (2011) Indus Script Dictionary, page viii</ref>
In 2014, a cave in the state of Kerala was found to have Indus script engravings.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:The 'Ten Indus Scripts' discovered near the northern gateway of the Dholavira citadel.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>Ten [[Indus script|Indus characters]] from the northern gate of [[Dholavira]], dubbed the [[Dholavira Signboard]].</center>]]
The characters are largely pictorial but include many abstract signs. The inscriptions are thought to have been written mostly from right-to-left (because there are several instances of the symbols being compressed on the left side, as if the writer is running out of space at the end of the row there), but they sometimes follow a [[boustrophedonic]] style. The number of principal signs is about 400. Since that is considered too large a number for each character to be a phonogram, the script is generally believed to instead be [[Logogram|logo-syllabic]].

== Decipherability question ==

An opposing hypothesis that has been offered by [[Michael Witzel]] and Steve Farmer, is that these symbols are nonlinguistic signs, which symbolise families, clans, gods, and religious concepts and are similar to components of [[coats of arms]] or [[totem poles]].<ref>Farmer ''et al.'' (2004)</ref> In a 2004 article, Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel presented a number of arguments stating that the Indus script is nonlinguistic. The main ones are the extreme brevity of the inscriptions, the existence of too many rare signs (which increase over the 700-year period of the Mature Harappan civilization) and the lack of the random-looking sign repetition that is typical of language.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lawler | first1 = Andrew | year = 2004 | title = The Indus script: Write or wrong? | url = | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = | pages = 2026–2029 | doi=10.1126/science.306.5704.2026}}</ref>

[[Asko Parpola]], reviewing the Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel thesis in 2005, stated that their arguments "can be easily controverted".<ref>(Parpola, 2005, p. 37)</ref> He cited the presence of a large number of rare signs in Chinese and emphasised that there was "little reason for sign repetition in short seal texts written in an early logo-syllabic script". Revisiting the question in a 2007 lecture,<ref>(Parpola, 2008).</ref> Parpola took on each of the 10 main arguments of Farmer ''et al.'', presenting counterarguments for each.

A 2009 paper<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rao|first=R.P.N.|title=Entropic Evidence for Linguistic Structure in the Indus Script|doi=10.1126/science.1170391 |journal=Science|volume=324|date=6 May 2009|url=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/ScienceIndus.pdf|pmid=19389998|pages=1165|display-authors=etal}}</ref> published by [[Rajesh P.N. Rao|Rajesh P N Rao]], [[Iravatham Mahadevan]] and others in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' also challenged the argument that the Indus script might have been a nonlinguistic symbol system. The paper concluded that the [[conditional entropy]] of Indus inscriptions closely matched those of linguistic systems like the Sumerian logo-syllabic system, Rig Vedic Sanskrit etc., but they are careful to stress that by itself does not imply that the script is linguistic. A follow-up study presented further evidence in terms of entropies of longer sequences of symbols beyond pairs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rao|first=R.P.N.|title=Probabilistic Analysis of an Ancient Undeciphered Script|journal=IEEE Computer|volume=43 | issue = 4|pages=76–80|date=April 2010|url=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rao/ieeeIndus.pdf|doi=10.1109/mc.2010.112}}</ref> 
However, Sproat claimed that there existed a number of misunderstandings in Rao ''et al.'', including a lack of discriminative power in their model, and argued that applying their model to known non-linguistic systems such as Mesopotamian deity symbols produced similar results to the Indus script. Rao et al.'s argument against Sproat's claims and Sproat's reply were published in ''[[Computational Linguistics (journal)|Computational Linguistics]]'' in December 2010.<ref>[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/toc/coli/36/4 Computational Linguistics], Volume 36, Issue 4, December 2010.</ref> The June 2014 issue of [[Language (journal)|''Language'']] carries a paper by Sproat that provides further evidence that the methodology of Rao ''et al.'' is flawed.<ref>R.

== Attempts at decipherment ==
{{Further information|Harappan language}}
[[File:Indus script.jpg|thumb|A few tablets with Indus script.]]
Over the years, numerous [[decipherment]]s have been proposed, but there is no established scholarly consensus.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective|page=136|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pmAuAsi4ePIC&pg=PA136&dq=|author=Gregory L. Possehl}}</ref> The following factors are usually regarded as the biggest obstacles for a successful decipherment:
* The underlying language has not been identified though some 300 loanwords in the [[Rigveda]] are a good starting point for comparison.<ref>FBJ Kuiper, Aryans in the Rigveda, Amsterdam/Atlanta 1991</ref><ref>M. Witzel underlines the prefixing nature of these words and calls them Para-Munda, a language related to but not belonging to Proto-Munda; see:
Witzel, M. Substrate Languages in Old Indo-Aryan (Ṛgvedic, Middle and Late Vedic), EJVS Vol. 5,1, 1999, 1-67</ref>
* The average length of the inscriptions is less than five signs, the longest being only 26 signs long<ref>[http://www.safarmer.com/indus/longestinscription.htm Longest Indus inscription]</ref>, although recent findings have revealed copper plates belonging to the mature Harappan period, one of them having 34 characters inscribed onto it.<ref>Shinde, V. & Willis, R.J., (2014). A New Type of Inscribed Copper Plate from Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilisation . Ancient Asia . 5 , p . Art. 1 . DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/aa.12317</ref>
* No bilingual texts (like a [[Rosetta Stone]]) have been found.

The topic is popular among amateur researchers, and there have been various (mutually exclusive) decipherment claims.<ref>see e.g. [[Egbert Richter]] and [[N. S. Rajaram]] for examples.</ref>

=== Dravidian hypothesis ===
[[File:Brahmi and Indus seal proposed connection.jpg|thumb|A proposed connection between the [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] and Indus scripts, made in the 19th century by [[Alexander Cunningham]].]]
The Russian scholar [[Yuri Knorozov]] suggested, based on computer analysis, the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] language as the most likely candidate for the underlying language of the script.<ref>(Knorozov 1965)</ref> Knorozov's suggestion was preceded by the work of [[Henry Heras]], who also suggested several readings of signs based on a proto-Dravidian assumption.<ref>(Heras, 1953)</ref>

The Finnish scholar [[Asko Parpola]] wrote that the Indus script and Harappan language "most likely belonged to the Dravidian family".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate|page=183|author=Edwin Bryant|publisher=Oxford|isbn=9780195169478}}</ref> Parpola led a Finnish team in the 1960s-80s that, like Knorozov's Soviet team worked towards investigating the inscriptions using computer analysis. Based on a proto-Dravidian assumption, the teams proposed readings of many signs. A number of people agreed with the suggested readings of Heras and Knorozov. One such reading was legitimised  when the Dravidian word for both 'fish' and 'star', "min" was hinted at through drawings of both the things together on Harappan seals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indus Script|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/indus.html|website=ancient scripts.com}}</ref> A comprehensive description of Parpola's work until 1994 is given in his book ''Deciphering the Indus Script.''<ref>(Parpola, 1994)</ref>

[[Iravatham Mahadevan]], another historian who supports the Dravidian hypothesis, says, "we may hopefully find that the proto-Dravidian roots of the Harappan language and South Indian Dravidian languages are similar. This is a hypothesis [...] But I have no illusions that I will decipher the Indus script, nor do I have any regret".<ref>[http://www.harappa.com/script/mahadevantext.html#14 Interview at Harrappa.com]</ref> Commenting on his 2014 publication ''Dravidian Proof of the Indus Script via The Rig Veda: A Case Study'', Mahadevan claims to have made significant progress in deciphering the script as Dravidian.<ref>{{cite web |title=‘Indus script early form of Dravidian’ |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/indus-script-early-form-of-dravidian-iravatham-mahadevan/article6600394.ece |publisher=The Hindu |accessdate=21 October 2018}}</ref> According to Mahadevan, a stone [[celt (tool)|celt]] discovered in [[Mayiladuthurai]] (Tamil Nadu) has the same markings as that of the symbols of the Indus script. The celt dates to early 2nd millennium BCE, post-dating Harappan decline. Mahadevan considers this as evidence of the same language being used by the neolithic people of south India and the late Harappans.<ref>(Subramanium 2006; see also [https://www.harappa.com/content/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html A Note on the Muruku Sign of the Indus Script in light of the Mayiladuthurai Stone Axe Discovery] by I.

In May 2007, the [[Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department]] found pots with arrow-head symbols during an excavation in Melaperumpallam near Poompuhar. These symbols are claimed to have a striking resemblance to seals unearthed in [[Mohenjo-daro]] in present-day [[Pakistan]] in the 1920s.<ref name="indus_coastaltn">{{cite news | last=Subramaniam | first=T.

==="Sanskritic" hypothesis===
[[File:Indus Valley Civilisation Rangoli.jpg|thumb|Indus people endless knot symbol ([[Rangoli]]) and inscription possibly proto Dravidian or proto Sanskrit]]
Indian archaeologist [[Shikaripura Ranganatha Rao]] claimed to have deciphered the Indus script. He compared it to the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and assigned sound values based on this comparison. His decipherment results in a "[[Indo-Aryan languages|Sanskritic]]" reading, including the numerals ''aeka, tra, chatus, panta, happta/sapta, dasa, dvadasa, sata'' (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 100).<ref>{{cite book|title=A Manual of Historical Research Methodology|page=268|year=2007|publisher=South Indian Studies|author=Sreedharan}}</ref> He also noted a number of striking similarities in shape and form between the late Harappan characters and the Phoenician letters, arguing that the Phoenician script evolved from the Harappan script, and not, as the classical theory suggests from the [[Proto-Sinaitic]] script.<ref name=LostLanguages>Robinson, Andrew. ''Lost Languages: The Enigma of the World's Undeciphered Scripts.'' 2002</ref>

John E. Mitchiner dismissed some of these attempts at decipherment. Mitchiner mentioned that "a more soundly-based but still greatly subjective and unconvincing attempt to discern an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] basis in the script has been that of Rao".<ref>J.E. Mitchiner: ''Studies in the Indus Valley Inscriptions'', p.5, with reference to S.R. Rao:   ''Lothal and the Indus Civilisation'' (ch.10), Bombay 1978.</ref>

===Miscellaneous hypotheses ===
There have been several hypotheses regarding the language pertaining to the Indus Script. One of the most common ones has been that the script belongs to the Indo-Aryan language. However, there are many problems with this hypothesis. A major one includes: Since the people belonging to the Indo-European cultures were always on the move, horses played a very important role in their lives or as Parpola put it, "There is no escape from the fact that the horse played a central role in the Vedic and Iranian cultures..." (Parpola, 1986). However, no depiction of horses on seals nor any remains of horses have been found in the subcontinent before 2000 BCE. Thus, it is very likely there were no Aryan speakers present before 2000 BCE in the Indus Valley.

A second, though not as popular hypothesis is that the Indus script belongs to the Munda family of languages. The [[Munda languages|Munda family of languages]] is spoken largely in Eastern India, and is related to some Southeast Asian languages. However, much like the Indo-Aryan language, the reconstructed vocabulary of early Munda does not reflect the Harappan culture. Therefore, its candidacy for being the language of the Indus Civilization is dim.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indus Script|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/indus.html|website=ancientscripts.com}}</ref>

Scholars also compare the Indus valley script with a writing system from ancient Persia, known as [[Linear Elamite]]. The two languages were contemporary to each other. Scholars gained knowledge of the Elamite language from a bilingual monument called the Table of the Lion in the Louvre museum. The monument contained the same text in Akkadian, a known writing system, and in Linear Elamite. On comparing this ancient language to the Indus script, a number of similar symbols have been found.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Redalia|first1=Suzanne|title=Cracking the Indus Script: A Potential Breakthrough|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/how-i-deciphered-the-indus-valley-script|website=swarajyamag.com}}</ref>

The Dholavira signboard is one of the longest in the Indus script, with one symbol appearing four times, and this and its large size and public nature make it a key piece of evidence cited by scholars arguing that the Indus script represents full literacy.

Other languages connected to the script include Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan.
Further possibilities include nearby [[language isolates]] such as [[Burushaski]], [[Kusunda language|Kusunda]] and [[Nihali]] as well as the extinct [[Sumerian civilization]] with which there was trade contact.

==Encoding==
The Indus symbols have been assigned the [[ISO 15924]] code "Inds". The script was proposed for encoding in Unicode's [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]] in 1999; however, the [[Unicode Consortium]] still lists the proposal in pending status.<ref>{{harvnb|Everson|1999}} and http://unicode.org/pending/pending.html</ref> At the International Conference on Mohenjodaro and Indus Valley Civilisation 2017 it was noted <!-- or announced it seems unclear--> that two language engineers, Amar Fayaz Buriro and Shabir Kumbhar have engineered all 1839 signs of Indus script and presented a developed font.<ref>https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/188398-Revisiting-Mohenjodaro</ref><ref>https://www.mohenjodaroonline.net/index.php/indus-script</ref>
