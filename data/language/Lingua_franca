Whereas a [[vernacular]] language is the native language of a specific geographical community, a lingua franca is used beyond the boundaries of its original community, for trade, religious, political or academic reasons.  For example, English is a vernacular in the United Kingdom but is used as a lingua franca in the [[Philippines]].  [[Arabic language|Arabic]], French, [[Mandarin language|Mandarin Chinese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and Russian, serve a similar purpose as industrial/educational lingua francas, across regional and national boundaries.

[[International auxiliary language]]s created with the purpose of being lingua francas such as [[Esperanto]] and [[Lingua Franca Nova]] have not had a great degree of adoption globally so they cannot be described as global lingua francas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/language-technologies/docs/lingua-franca-en.pdf|title=Studies on translation and multilingualism|last=Directorate-General for Translation|first=European Commission|year=2011|publisher=Europa (web portal)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115090926/http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/language-technologies/docs/lingua-franca-en.pdf|archive-date=2012-11-15|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The term ''lingua franca'' derives from [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]], the language that people around the [[Levant]] and the eastern Mediterranean Sea used as the main language of commerce and diplomacy from late [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], especially during the [[Renaissance era]], to the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/lingua-franca|title=lingua franca {{!}} linguistics|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=8 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> At that time, Italian-speakers dominated seaborne commerce in the port cities of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and a simplified version of Italian, including many [[loan words]] from [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Old French language|Old French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Occitan]], and Spanish as well as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] came to be widely used as the "lingua franca" (in the generic sense used) of the region.

In Lingua Franca (the specific language), ''lingua'' means a language, as in Portuguese and Italian, and ''franca'' is related to ''phrankoi'' in Greek and ''faranji'' in Arabic as well as the equivalent Italian. In all three cases, the literal sense is "[[Frankish language|Frankish]]", but the name actually applied to all Western Europeans during the late [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name=HEL>{{cite book|url=http://www.komvos.edu.gr/dictonlineplsql/simple_search.display_full_lemma?the_lemma_id=16800&target_dict=1|title=''Lexico Triantaphyllide'' online dictionary, Greek Language Center (''Kentro Hellenikes Glossas''), lemma Franc ( Φράγκος ''Phrankos''), ''Lexico tes Neas Hellenikes Glossas'', G.Babiniotes, Kentro Lexikologias(Legicology Center) LTD Publications|isbn=960-86190-1-7|quote=Franc and (prefix) franco- (Φράγκος ''Phrankos'' and φράγκο- ''phranko-''|publisher=Komvos.edu.gr|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00weekuoft/ |title=An etymological dictionary of modern English : Weekley, Ernest, 1865–1954 : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/14047074/Dictionary-English-Etymology-Origins-A-Short-Etymological-Dictionary-of-Modern-English-Rouledge-1958-Parridge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012185830/http://www.scribd.com/doc/14047074/Dictionary-English-Etymology-Origins-A-Short-Etymological-Dictionary-of-Modern-English-Rouledge-1958-Parridge|date=12 October 2014}}</ref>

The Douglas Harper Etymology Dictionary states that the term ''Lingua Franca'' (as the name of the particular language) was first recorded in English during the 1670s,<ref name="Harper">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=lingua+franca |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref> although an even earlier example of the use of ''Lingua Franca'' in English is attested from 1632, where it is also referred to as "Bastard Spanish".<ref name="Morgan">{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=J. |year=1632 |title=A Compleat History of the Present Seat of War in Africa, Between the Spaniards and Algerines |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M8TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref>

As recently as the late 20th century, some restricted the use of the generic term to mean only [[Mixed language|hybrid languages]] that are used as vehicular languages, its original meaning, but it now refers to any vehicular language.<ref>Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, Simon and Schuster, 1980</ref>

The term is well established in its naturalization to English, which is why major dictionaries do not italicize it as a "foreign" term.<ref name="OxfordDictionaries">{{Citation |author=Oxford Dictionaries |authorlink=OxfordDictionaries.com |title=Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/ |postscript=.}}</ref><ref name="AHD">{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}</ref><ref name="MW_Collegiate">{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=MerriamWebster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}</ref> Its plurals in English are '''lingua francas''' and '''linguae francae''',<ref name="AHD"/><ref name="MW_Collegiate"/> with the first of those being first-listed<ref name="AHD"/><ref name="MW_Collegiate"/> or only-listed<ref name="OxfordDictionaries"/> in major dictionaries.

{{main article|List of lingua francas}}
The use of lingua francas has existed since antiquity. [[Latin]] and [[Koine Greek]] were the lingua francas of the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Hellenistic]] culture. [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (died out during [[Classical antiquity]]) and then [[Aramaic]] remained the common languages of a large part of Western Asia from several earlier empires.<ref>Ostler, 2005 pp. 38–40</ref><ref>Ostler, 2010 pp. 163–167</ref> {{Full citation needed|date= August 2018}}

In certain countries, the lingua franca is also the national language. [[Indonesia language|Indonesian]] – which originated from a [[Malay language]] variant spoken in [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate|Riau]] – has the same function in [[Indonesia]], although [[Javanese language|Javanese]] has more native speakers. Still, Indonesian is the sole official language and is spoken throughout the country. Also [[Persian language|Persian]] is both the lingua franca of [[Iran]] and its national language.

The only documented [[sign language]] used as a lingua franca is [[Plains Indian Sign Language]], used across much of North America. It was used as a second language across many indigenous peoples. Alongside or a derivation of Plains Indian Sign Language was [[Plateau Sign Language]], now extinct. [[Inuit Sign Language]] could be a similar case in the Arctic among the [[Inuit]] for communication across oral language boundaries, but little research exists.

In the [[European Union]], the use of [[English as a lingua franca]] has led to the emergence of a new dialect called [[Euro English]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mollin|first1=Sandra|title=Euro-English assessing variety status|date=2005|publisher=Narr|location=Tübingen|isbn=382336250X}}</ref>
