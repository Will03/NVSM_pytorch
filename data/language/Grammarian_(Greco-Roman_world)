In the [[Greco-Roman world]], the '''grammarian (or grammaticus)''' was responsible for the second stage in the traditional education system, after a boy had learned his basic Greek and Latin.<ref name=McN>McNelis, C. (2007) "Grammarians and rhetoricians" in Dominik, W. and Hall, J. (eds.) ''A companion to Roman rhetoric''. Oxford: [[Blackwell Publishing]], pp. 285-296. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-2091-3}}</ref> The job of the grammarian was to teach the ancient poets such as [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], and the correct way of speaking before a boy moved on to study under the rhetor. Despite often humble origins, some grammarians went on to achieve elevated positions in Rome, though few enjoyed financial success.

==Grammar==
In about 100 B.C., [[Dionysius Thrax]] defined grammar as an "acquired expertise of the general usage of poets and prose writers". He identified six elements to the field:<ref name=McN/>

*Accurate reading aloud
*Explanation of literary devices
*Comments on subject matter
*Comments on etymologies
*Working out analogical regularities
*The critical study of literature.

Nearly two hundred years later, [[Quintilian]] defined the subject as the knowledge of proper speaking and the explication of the poets.<ref name=McN/><ref>Quintilian, ''Inst''. 1.4.2</ref>

==Position==
Some grammarians achieved elevated positions in the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] world and enjoyed preferential treatment, despite their relatively lowly job and often humble origins. They were exempt from local taxes in Rome for instance.<ref>[[Suetonius]]. ''Iul''. 42.1, ''Aug''. 42.3</ref> By tutoring the children of the wealthy, grammarians could meet and become associated with prominent families in Rome. [[Marcus Antonius Gnipho]] was part of the household of [[Julius Caesar]].<ref>Suetonius. ''Gram''. 7.2</ref> This despite the fact that some noted grammarians had originally been brought to Rome as captives. Twelve of the twenty grammarians described by [[Suetonius]] in ''De Illustribus Grammaticis'' had been slaves.<ref>Suetonius. ''Gram''. 6.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1, 13.1, 15.1, 16.1, 17.1, 18.1, 19.1, 20.1, 23.1.</ref>

Latin grammarians, like their Greek equivalents, came from all over the [[Roman Empire]], including Syria, Spain, Gaul, Athens and Italy.<ref name=McN/>
