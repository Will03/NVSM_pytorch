'''Neurolinguistics''' is the study of the [[Neuron|neural]] mechanisms in the [[human brain]] that control the comprehension, production, and acquisition of [[language]]. As an interdisciplinary field, neurolinguistics draws methods and theories from fields such as [[neuroscience]], [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[communication disorder]]s and [[neuropsychology]].  Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language.  Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], [[electrophysiology]], and [[computer modeling]].<ref name="Nakai_2017">{{cite journal|last2=Jeong|first2=JW|last3=Brown|first3=EC|last4=Rothermel|first4=R|last5=Kojima|first5=K|last6=Kambara|first6=T|last7=Shah|first7=A|last8=Mittal|first8=S|last9=Sood|first9=S|last10=Asano|first10=E|year=2017|title=Three- and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy|journal=Brain|volume=140|pages=1351-1370|doi=10.1093/brain/awx051|pmid=28334963|last1=Nakai|first1=Y}}</ref>

Neurolinguistics is historically rooted in the development in the 19th century of [[aphasiology]], the study of linguistic deficits ([[aphasia]]s) occurring as the result of [[brain damage]].<ref name="phillipssakai"/>  Aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing.<ref name="kamil">{{cite web | url=http://www.tlumaczenia-angielski.info/linguistics/neurolinguistics.htm | title=Neurolinguistics | accessdate=31 January 2009 | date=12 August 2007 | first=Kamil | last=Wiśniewski | work=Język angielski online}}</ref>  One of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was [[Paul Broca]],<ref name="phillipssakai">{{cite encyclopedia | last1=Phillips | first1=Colin |author2=Kuniyoshi L.

The coining of the term "neurolinguistics" is attributed to Edith Crowell Trager, Henri Hecaen and Alexandr Luria, in the late 1940s and 1950s; Luria's book "Problems in Neurolinguistics" is likely the first book with Neurolinguistics in the title. Harry Whitaker popularized neurolinguistics in the United States in the 1970s, founding the journal "Brain and Language" in 1974.<ref name="Peng 1985">{{cite journal | last=Peng | first=F.C.C. | year=1985 | title=What is neurolinguistics? | journal=Journal of Neurolinguistics | volume=1 | issue=1 | doi=10.1016/S0911-6044(85)80003-8 | pages=7}}</ref>

Although aphasiology is the historical core of neurolinguistics, in recent years the field has broadened considerably, thanks in part to the emergence of new brain imaging technologies (such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]]) and time-sensitive electrophysiological techniques ([[EEG]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]]), which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks;<ref name="phillipssakai"/><ref>Brown, Colin M.; and Peter Hagoort (1999).  "The cognitive neuroscience of language." in Brown & Hagoort, ''The Neurocognition of Language.'' p. 6.</ref><ref name="weisler293"/> electrophysiological techniques, in particular, emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]], a brain response shown to be sensitive to [[Semantics|semantic]] issues in language comprehension.<ref name="hagoort unification20">{{cite journal | year=2003 | last=Hagoort | first=Peter | title=How the brain solves the binding problem for language: a neurocomputational model of syntactic processing | journal=NeuroImage | volume=20 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.013 | pmid=14597293 | pages=S18–29}}</ref><ref name=Hall274>{{cite book | title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics | last=Hall | first=Christopher J | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWspkUKj274C&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=neurolinguistics+and+psycholinguistics | page=274 | year=2005 | isbn=0-8264-8734-3 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group}}</ref>  The N400 was the first language-relevant [[event-related potential]] to be identified, and since its discovery EEG and MEG have become increasingly widely used for conducting language research.<ref name=neurocognition280>Hagoort, Peter; Colin M.

{{Linguistics}}

===Interaction with other fields===
Neurolinguistics is closely related to the field of [[psycholinguistics]], which seeks to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of [[experimental psychology]]; today, psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another, and there is much collaboration between the two fields.<ref name=Hall274/><ref name="hagoort unification">{{cite journal | year=2003 | last=Hagoort | first=Peter | title=How the brain solves the binding problem for language: a neurocomputational model of syntactic processing | journal=NeuroImage | volume=20 | pages=S19&ndash;S20 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.013 | pmid=14597293}}</ref>

Much work in neurolinguistics involves testing and evaluating theories put forth by psycholinguists and theoretical linguists.  In general, theoretical linguists propose models to explain the structure of language and how language information is organized, psycholinguists propose models and algorithms to explain how language information is processed in the mind, and neurolinguists analyze brain activity to infer how biological structures (populations and networks of neurons) carry out those psycholinguistic processing algorithms.<ref name="pylkannen slides">{{cite web | title=What is neurolinguistics? | last=Pylkkänen | first=Liina | accessdate=31 January 2009 | url=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/pylkkanen/Neural_Bases/01_Intro.pdf |page=2}}</ref>  For example, experiments in [[sentence processing]] have used the [[ELAN (neuroscience)|ELAN]], [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]], and [[P600 (neuroscience)|P600]] brain responses to examine how physiological brain responses reflect the different predictions of sentence processing models put forth by psycholinguists, such as [[Janet Dean Fodor|Janet Fodor]] and [[Lyn Frazier]]'s "serial" model,<ref>See, for example, {{cite journal | journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | volume=6 | issue=2 | last=Friederici | first=Angela D. | year=2002 | title=Towards a neural basis of auditory sentence processing | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01839-8 | pages=78}}, which discusses how three brain responses reflect three stages of Fodor and Frazier's model.</ref> and Theo Vosse and Gerard Kempen's "unification model".<ref name="hagoort unification"/>  Neurolinguists can also make new predictions about the structure and organization of language based on insights about the physiology of the brain, by "generalizing from the knowledge of neurological structures to language structure".<ref>Weisler (1999), p. 280.</ref>

===Topics considered===
Neurolinguistics research investigates several topics, including where language information is processed, how language processing unfolds over time, how brain structures are related to language acquisition and learning, and how neurophysiology can contribute to [[speech and language pathology]].

====Localizations of language processes====
Much work in neurolinguistics has, like Broca's and Wernicke's early studies, investigated the locations of specific language "[[Language module|modules]]" within the brain.  Research questions include what course language information follows through the brain as it is processed,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Opinion: The cortical organization of speech processing | last1=Hickock | first1=Gregory |author2=David Poeppel | journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience | url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v8/n5/abs/nrn2113.html | volume=8 | year=2007 | issue=5 | pmid=17431404 | doi=10.1038/nrn2113 | pages=393&ndash;402}}</ref> whether or not particular areas specialize in processing particular sorts of information,<ref name=embicketal>{{cite journal | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/11/6150.abstract?ck=nck | title=A syntactic specialization for Broca's area | last1=Embick | first1=David |author2=Alec Marantz; Yasushi Miyashita; Wayne O'Neil; Kuniyoshi L.

"The cognitive neuroscience of language." in Brown & Hagoort. ''The Neurocognition of Language''. p. 7.</ref> and how the locations of brain activation differs when a subject is producing or perceiving a language other than his or her first language.<ref name=wangetal/><ref name="LSA"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=brainBriefings_thebilingualbrain | publisher=[[Society for Neuroscience]] |date=February 2008 | accessdate=1 February 2009 | work=Brain Briefings | title=The Bilingual Brain}}</ref>

====Time course of language processes====
Another area of neurolinguistics literature involves the use of [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] techniques to analyze the rapid processing of language in time.<ref name="phillipssakai"/>  The temporal ordering of specific [[Event-related potential#ERP Components Nomenclature|patterns of in brain activity]] may reflect discrete computational processes that the brain undergoes during language processing; for example, one neurolinguistic theory of sentence parsing proposes that three brain responses (the [[ELAN (neuroscience)|ELAN]], [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]], and [[P600 (neuroscience)|P600]]) are products of three different steps in syntactic and semantic processing.<ref name="friederici2002"/>

====Language acquisition====
Another topic is the relationship between brain structures and [[language acquisition]].<ref>Caplan (1987), p. 11.</ref> Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as [[babbling]]), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development,<ref name="caplan12">Caplan (1987), p. 12.</ref> while other research investigates the physical changes (known as [[neuroplasticity]]) that the brain undergoes during [[second language acquisition]], when adults learn a new language.<ref name=sereno>{{cite book | title=Language Experience in Second Language Speech Learning | editor=Ocke-Schwen Bohn |editor2=Murray J. Munro | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company | location=Philadelphia | year=2007 | chapter=Behavioral and cortical effects of learning a second language: The acquisition of tone | last1=Sereno | first1=Joan A |author2=Yue Wang}}</ref>
Neuroplasticity is observed when both Second Language acquisition and Language Learning experience are induced, the result of this language exposure concludes that an increase of gray and white matter could be found in children, young adults and the elderly.

====Language pathology====
Neurolinguistic techniques are also used to study disorders and breakdowns in language, such as [[aphasia]] and [[dyslexia]], and how they relate to physical characteristics of the brain.<ref name="LSA"/><ref name="caplan12"/>

==Technology used==
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=PET-image.jpg|image2=Functional magnetic resonance imaging.jpg|width=150|caption2=Images of the brain recorded with [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] (top) and [[fMRI]] (bottom). In the PET image, the red areas are the most active. In the fMRI image, the yellowest areas are the areas that show the greatest difference in activation between two tasks (watching a moving stimulus, versus watching a black screen).}}
Since one of the focuses of this field is the testing of linguistic and psycholinguistic models, the technology used for experiments is highly relevant to the study of neurolinguistics. Modern brain imaging techniques have contributed greatly to a growing understanding of the anatomical organization of linguistic functions.<ref name="phillipssakai"/><ref name="LSA">{{cite web | publisher=[[Linguistic Society of America]] | last=Menn | first=Lise | accessdate=18 December 2008 | title=Neurolinguistics | url=http://www.lsadc.org/info/ling-fields-neuro.cfm}}</ref>  Brain imaging methods used in neurolinguistics may be classified into [[hemodynamic]] methods, [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] methods, and methods that stimulate the cortex directly.

===Hemodynamic===
{{Main|Neuroimaging}}
Hemodynamic techniques take advantage of the fact that when an area of the brain works at a task, blood is sent to supply that area with oxygen (in what is known as the Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent, or BOLD, response).<ref name="ward">{{cite book | last=Ward | first=Jamie | year=2006 | chapter=The imaged brain | title=The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience | isbn=1-84169-534-3 | publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref>  Such techniques include [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]].  These techniques provide high ''spatial resolution'', allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of activity within the brain;<ref name="phillipssakai"/> ''temporal resolution'' (or information about the timing of brain activity), on the other hand, is poor, since the BOLD response happens much more slowly than language processing.<ref name="weisler293">Weisler (1999), p. 293.</ref><ref name="kutas">{{cite journal | year=2002 | volume=4 | issue=12 | journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | last1=Kutas | first1=Marta |author2=Kara D. Federmeier | title=Electrophysiology reveals memory use in language comprehension}}</ref>  In addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations,<ref name=embicketal/><ref name="friederici2002">{{cite journal | last=Friederici | first=Angela D. | year=2002 | journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | title=Towards a neural basis of auditory sentence processing | volume=6 | issue=2 | pages=78&ndash;84 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01839-8}}</ref> hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain's language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time, as a function of linguistic exposure.<ref name=wangetal>{{cite journal | year=2003 |author1=Wang Yue |author2=Joan A. Sereno; Allard Jongman; and Joy Hirsch | title=fMRI evidence for cortical modification during learning of Mandarin lexical tone | pmid=14614812 | journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume=15 | issue=7 | pages=1019&ndash;1027 | doi=10.1162/089892903770007407}}</ref><ref name=sereno/>

In addition to PET and fMRI, which show which areas of the brain are activated by certain tasks, researchers also use [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI), which shows the neural pathways that connect different brain areas,<ref name=Filler1992>Filler AG, Tsuruda JS, Richards TL, Howe FA: Images, apparatus, algorithms and methods. GB 9216383, UK Patent Office, 1992.</ref> thus providing insight into how different areas interact. [[Functional near-infrared spectroscopy]] (fNIRS) is another hemodynamic method used in language tasks.<ref name="dieleretal2011">{{cite journal | first=Ana Inés | last=Ansaldo | first2=Karima | last2=Kahlaoui | first3=Yves | last3=Joanette | title=Functional near-infrared spectroscopy: Looking at the brain and language mystery from a different angle | journal=Brain and Language | year=2011 | volume=121 | issue=2, number 2 |pages=77–8 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2012.03.001| pmid=22445199 }}</ref>

===Electrophysiological===
[[File:Spike-waves.png|left|thumb|Brain waves recorded using [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]]]
Electrophysiological techniques take advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons in the brain fire together, they create an [[Dipole|electric dipole]] or current.  The technique of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] measures this electric current using sensors on the scalp, while [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] measures the magnetic fields that are generated by these currents.<ref name="tracking"/> In addition to these non-invasive methods, [[electrocorticography]] has also been used to study language processing. These techniques are able to measure brain activity from one millisecond to the next, providing excellent ''temporal resolution'', which is important in studying processes that take place as quickly as language comprehension and production.<ref name="tracking">{{cite journal | journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | year=2003 | volume=7 | issue=5 | title=Tracking the time course of word recognition with MEG | last1=Pylkkänen | first1=Liina |author2=[[Alec Marantz]] | pages=187&ndash;189 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00092-5}}</ref>  On the other hand, the location of brain activity can be difficult to identify in EEG;<ref name="kutas"/><ref name="van petten?">{{cite journal | last=Van Petten | first=Cyma | last2=Luka | first2=Barbara | title=Neural localization of semantic context effects in electromagnetic and hemodynamic studies | year=2006 | journal=Brain and Language | volume=97 | page=281 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2005.11.003 }}</ref> consequently, this technique is used primarily to ''how'' language processes are carried out, rather than ''where''.  Research using EEG and MEG generally focuses on [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs),<ref name="kutas"/> which are distinct brain responses (generally realized as negative or positive peaks on a graph of neural activity) elicited in response to a particular stimulus.  Studies using ERP may focus on each ERP's ''latency'' (how long after the stimulus the ERP begins or peaks), ''amplitude'' (how high or low the peak is), or ''topography'' (where on the scalp the ERP response is picked up by sensors).<ref>{{cite book | url=http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~ctg/classes/lib/cogsci/Rugg-ColesChp1.pdf | chapter=Event-related brain potentials: an introduction | year=1996 | title=Electrophysiology of Mind | pages=1&ndash;27 | publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online Monographs |author2=Michael D.

==Experimental design==

===Experimental techniques===
Neurolinguists employ a variety of experimental techniques in order to use brain imaging to draw conclusions about how language is represented and processed in the brain.  These techniques include the ''subtraction'' paradigm, ''[[Mismatch negativity|mismatch]] design'', ''violation-based'' studies, various forms of ''[[Priming (psychology)|priming]]'', and ''direct stimulation'' of the brain.

====Subtraction====
Many language studies, particularly in [[fMRI]], use the subtraction paradigm,<ref name="Grabowski">Grabowski, T., and Damasio, A." (2000). Investigating language with functional neuroimaging. ''San Diego, CA, US: Academic Press. 14'', 425-461.</ref> in which brain activation in a task thought to involve some aspect of language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes but not to involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while participants read words may be compared to baseline activations while participants read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate activation related to lexical processing&mdash;the processing of real words), or activations while participants read [[syntax|syntactically]] complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while participants read simpler sentences.

====Mismatch paradigm====
{{Main|Mismatch negativity}}
The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a rigorously documented ERP component frequently used in neurolinguistic experiments.<ref name="pulvermulleretal2008">{{cite journal | title=Syntax as a reflex: neurophysiological evidence for the early automaticity of syntactic processing | journal=Brain and Language | year=2008 | volume=104 | issue=3 | pmid=17624417 | last1=Pulvermüller |first1=Friedemann |author2=Yury Shtyrov; Anna S.

====Violation-based====
[[File:ComponentsofERP.svg|right|thumb|An [[event-related potential]]]]
Many studies in neurolinguistics take advantage of anomalies or ''violations'' of [[Syntax|syntactic]] or [[Semantics|semantic]] rules in experimental stimuli, and analyzing the brain responses elicited when a subject encounters these violations. For example, sentences beginning with phrases such as *''the garden was on the worked'',<ref>Example from Frisch et al. (2004: 195).</ref> which violates an English [[phrase structure rule]], often elicit a brain response called the [[early left anterior negativity]] (ELAN).<ref name="frisch194">{{cite journal | last1=Frisch | first1=Stefan |author2=Anja Hahne; Angela D.

====Priming====
{{Main|Priming (psychology)}}
In psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, ''priming'' refers to the phenomenon whereby a subject can recognize a word more quickly if he or she has recently been presented with a word that is similar in meaning<ref name="athabasca"/> or [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] makeup (i.e., composed of similar parts).<ref name="fiorentino"/> If a subject is presented with a "prime" word such as ''doctor'' and then a "target" word such as ''nurse'', if the subject has a faster-than-usual response time to ''nurse'' then the experimenter may assume that word ''nurse'' in the brain had already been accessed when the word ''doctor'' was accessed.<ref name="probe"/> Priming is used to investigate a wide variety of questions about how words are stored and retrieved in the brain<ref name="fiorentino"/><ref name="devlin">{{cite journal | title=Morphology and the internal structure of words | year=2004 |last1=Devlin |first1=Joseph T. |author2=Helen L.

===Subject tasks===
In many neurolinguistics experiments, subjects do not simply sit and listen to or watch [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], but also are instructed to perform some sort of task in response to the stimuli.<ref>One common exception to this is studies using the mismatch paradigm, in which subjects are often instructed to watch a silent movie or otherwise not pay attention actively to the stimuli.

====Lexical decision====
{{Main|Lexical decision task}}
The [[lexical decision task]] involves subjects seeing or hearing an isolated word and answering whether or not it is a real word.  It is frequently used in [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] studies, since subjects are known to make a lexical decision more quickly if a word has been primed by a related word (as in "doctor" priming "nurse").<ref name="athabasca">{{cite web | url=http://psych.athabascau.ca/html/Psych355/Exp/lexical.shtml?sso=true | accessdate=14 December 2008 | date=27 June 2005 | publisher=Athatbasca University | title=Experiment Description: Lexical Decision and Semantic Priming | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208115451/http://psych.athabascau.ca/html/Psych355/Exp/lexical.shtml?sso=true | archivedate=8 December 2009 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="fiorentino">{{cite journal | last1=Fiorentino | first1=Robert |author2=David Poeppel | title=Processing of compound words: an MEG study | journal=Brain and Language | volume=103 | year=2007 | pages=8&ndash;249 | doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2007.07.009}}</ref><ref name="probe">{{cite journal | title=Lexical integration: sequential effects of syntactic and semantic information | last1=Friederici | first1=Angela D. |author2=Karsten Steinhauer; Stefan Frisch | year=1999 | journal=Memory & Cognition | volume = 27 | issue=3 | pages=438–453 | doi=10.3758/BF03211539}}</ref>

====Grammaticality judgment, acceptability judgment====
Many studies, especially violation-based studies, have subjects make a decision about the "acceptability" (usually [[Grammaticality|grammatical acceptability]] or [[Semantics|semantic]] acceptability) of stimuli.<ref name="task effects"/><ref name="yeetal2006">{{cite journal | author1=Zheng Ye |author2=Yue-jia Luo; Angela D.

Experimental evidence has shown that the instructions given to subjects in an acceptability judgment task can influence the subjects' brain responses to stimuli.  One experiment showed that when subjects were instructed to judge the "acceptability" of sentences they did not show an [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] brain response (a response commonly associated with [[Semantics|semantic]] processing), but that they did show that response when instructed to ignore grammatical acceptability and only judge whether or not the sentences "made sense".<ref name="task effects"/>

====Probe verification====
Some studies use a "probe verification" task rather than an overt acceptability judgment; in this paradigm, each experimental sentence is followed by a "probe word", and subjects must answer whether or not the probe word had appeared in the sentence.<ref name="probe"/><ref name="frisch200"/>  This task, like the acceptability judgment task, ensures that subjects are reading or listening attentively, but may avoid some of the additional processing demands of acceptability judgments, and may be used no matter what type of violation is being presented in the study.<ref name="probe"/>

====Truth-value judgment====
Subjects may be instructed not to judge whether or not the sentence is grammatically acceptable or logical, but whether the [[proposition]] expressed by the sentence is true or false. This task is commonly used in psycholinguistic studies of child language.<ref>{{cite book | last=Gordon | first=Peter | chapter=The Truth-Value Judgment Task | title=Methods for assessing children's syntax | url=http://faculty.tc.columbia.edu/upload/pg328/TRUTHVALUECHAPT.pdf | editor=D.

Retrieved 14 December 2008.</ref>

====Active distraction and double-task====
Some experiments give subjects a "distractor" task to ensure that subjects are not consciously paying attention to the experimental stimuli; this may be done to test whether a certain computation in the brain is carried out automatically, regardless of whether the subject devotes [[Attention|attentional resources]] to it.  For example, one study had subjects listen to non-linguistic tones (long beeps and buzzes) in one ear and speech in the other ear, and instructed subjects to press a button when they perceived a change in the tone; this supposedly caused subjects not to pay explicit attention to grammatical violations in the speech stimuli.  The subjects showed a [[Mismatch negativity|mismatch response]] (MMN) anyway, suggesting that the processing of the grammatical errors was happening automatically, regardless of attention<ref name="pulvermulleretal2008"/>&mdash;or at least that subjects were unable to consciously separate their attention from the speech stimuli.

Another related form of experiment is the double-task experiment, in which a subject must perform an extra task (such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables) while responding to linguistic stimuli; this kind of experiment has been used to investigate the use of [[working memory]] in language processing.<ref name="rogalskyetal">{{cite journal | title=Broca's Area, Sentence Comprehension, and Working Memory: An fMRI Study | last1=Rogalsky | first1=Corianne |author2=William Matchin; Gregory Hickok | journal=[[Frontiers Research Foundation|Frontiers in Human Neuroscience]] | year=2008 | pages=14 | volume=2 | pmid=18958214 | pmc=2572210 | doi=10.3389/neuro.09.014.2008}}</ref>
