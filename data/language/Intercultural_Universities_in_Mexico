'''Intercultural Universities in Mexico''' are higher education institutions which were established in 2004 in response to the lack of enrollment of the [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous population]] in Mexico. While an estimated 10% of the population of [[Mexico]] is indigenous, it is the least represented in higher education. According to estimates, only between 1% and 3% of [[higher education]] enrollment in Mexico is indigenous. In response to this inequality, the General Coordination for Intercultural and Bilingual Education at the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública|Ministry of Education]] established Intercultural Universities with the active participation of indigenous organizations and academic institutions in each region.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Cairo/images/RethinkingEducation.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=47}}</ref> These institutions are located in densely indigenous areas and, though they allow for diversity in enrollment, they are especially intended for the indigenous population. Founded on the principle of [[intercultural education]], they aim to foster [[dialogue]] between different cultures and represent a way of responding to both the historical and more recent demands of indigenous peoples.<ref name=":0" />

In congruence with the recognition of diversity, Intercultural Universities do not propose a fixed approach to their [[education]]al activities. While assuring the respect of some basic principles, each [[university]] defines its curriculum according to the needs and potentials of the region in which it is located. [[Student]]s are engaged in activities that relate them to the surrounding communities through research and development projects, with the aim of working and contributing to the development of their territory, their people and their culture.<ref name=":0" /> Twelve Intercultural Universities are currently operating with a total enrollment of approximately 7,000 students and a high proportion of female students. Despite the challenges of financing, of students' [[living conditions]] and of political vulnerability that these universities face, they represent an important contribution to the achievement of educational equity.<ref name=":0" />
