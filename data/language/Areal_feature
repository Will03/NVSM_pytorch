{{Short description|Linguistic feature arising through language contact rather than common descent}}{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}In [[linguistics]], '''areal features''' are elements shared by languages or dialects in a geographic area, particularly when the languages are not descended from a [[Language family|common ancestor language]].

==Characteristics==
Resemblances between two or more languages (whether in typology or in vocabulary) can be due to [[Genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] relation (descent from a common ancestor language), to [[Loanword|borrowing]] between languages, to [[Stratum (linguistics)|retention of features]] when a population adopts a new language, or simply to chance. When little or no direct documentation of ancestor languages is available, determining whether a similarity is genetic or areal can be difficult. [[Edward Sapir]] notably used evidence of contact and diffusion as a negative tool for genetic reconstruction, treating it as a subject in its own right only at the end of his career (e.g., for the influence of [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]] on [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]]).<ref name="drechsel">Drechsel, Emanuel J. (1988). "Wilhelm von Humboldt and Edward Sapir: analogies and homologies in their linguistic thoughts", in

Genetic relationships are represented in the [[Tree model|family tree model]] of language change, and areal relationships are represented in the [[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]]. [[William Labov]] in 2007 reconciled these models in a general framework based on differences between children and adults in their language learning ability. Adults do not preserve structural features with sufficient regularity to establish a norm in their community, but children do. Linguistic features are diffused across an area by contacts among adults. Languages branch into dialects and thence into related languages through small changes in the course of children's learning processes which accumulate over generations, and when speech communities do not communicate (frequently) with each other, these cumulative changes diverge.<ref>

In some areas with high linguistic diversity, a number of areal features have spread across a set of languages to form a [[sprachbund]] (also known as a linguistic area, convergence area or diffusion area).  Some examples are the [[Balkan sprachbund]], the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], and the languages of the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Examples==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2007}}
{{original research|section|date=September 2018}}
* The use of the plural pronoun as a polite word for ''you'' in much of Europe (the [[T–V distinction|''tu-vous'' distinction]]).
* The spread of the [[guttural R]] from either German or French to several West European languages.
* The tendency to use a ''habeo'' (transitive, e.g. "I have") construction for possession in much of Europe, instead of a ''[[Dative case|mihi est]]'' (''to me is'') construction, which is more likely the original possessive construction in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], considering the lack of a common root for "have" verbs.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X8UOAAAAQAAJ&pg= Winfred Philipp Lehmann, ''Historical Linguistics: An Introduction'', Routledge, 1992, p. 170]</ref>
* The development of a [[perfect aspect]] using "have" + past participle in many European languages (Romance, Germanic, etc.).
* A [[perfect aspect]] using "be" + past participle for intransitive and reflexive verbs (with participle agreement), present in French, Italian, German, older Spanish and Portuguese, and possibly even English, in phrases like "I am become[ death, destroyer of worlds]" and "The kingdom of this world is become".
* Presence of {{IPA|/ɫ/}} ([[dark L]]), usually contrasting with palatalized {{IPA|/lʲ/}} in Slavic, Baltic and Turkic languages of Eastern Europe.
* Possibly the [[Satem]] sound change.
* Postposed [[Article (grammar)|article]], avoidance of the [[infinitive]], merging of [[genitive]] and [[dative]], and superessive [[grammatical number|number]] formation in some languages of the [[Balkans]].
* Development of a three-tone system with no tones in words ending in -p, -t, -k, followed by a tone split; many other phonetic similarities; a system of classifiers/measure words; etc. in the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]].
* [[Retroflex consonants]] in the [[Burushaski]],<ref>Berger, H. Die Burushaski-Sprache von Hunza und Nagar. Vols. I-III. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz 1988</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Tikkanen|2005}}</ref> [[Nuristani languages|Nuristani]],<ref>G. Morgenstierne, Irano-Dardica.

* The occurrence of [[click consonant]]s in Bantu languages of southern Africa, which originated in the [[Khoisan languages]].
* The lack of [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] in [[Australian languages]].
* The use of [[ejective consonants|ejective]] and [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] consonants in the [[languages of the Caucasus]].
* The spread of a [[subject–object–verb|verb-final word order]] to the [[Austronesian languages]] of [[New Guinea]].
* The prevalence of [[ejective consonant|ejective]] and [[lateral fricative]]s and [[lateral affricate|affricates]] in the Pacific Northwest of North America.
* The development of a [[close front rounded vowel]] in the [[Bearnese dialect]] of [[Occitan]] and the [[Souletin dialect]] of [[Basque language|Basque]].
* The absence of [w] and presence of [v] in many languages of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].
* The lack of nasal consonants in languages of the [[Puget Sound]] and the [[Olympic Peninsula]].
* The absence of [p] but presence of [b] and [f] in many languages of [[Northern Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]].  
* The presence of a voicing contrast on fricatives e.g. [s] vs [z] in [[Europe]] and [[Southwestern Asia]]..
