'''''Textus Receptus''''' ([[Latin]]: "received text") is the name given to the succession of printed [[Greek language|Greek]] texts of the [[New Testament]]. The term ''Textus Receptus'' may also apply to other ancient texts in other languages, traditionally copied and passed down by scribes.

The biblical ''Textus Receptus'' constituted the translation-base for the original [[German language|German]] [[Luther Bible]], the translation of the New Testament into [[English language|English]] by [[William Tyndale]], the [[King James Version]], the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Reina-Valera]] translation, and most [[Protestant reformation|Reformation-era]] New Testament translations throughout [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]].

The series originated with the first printed Greek New Testament, published in 1516—a work undertaken in [[Basel]] by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Catholic]] scholar, priest and monk [[Erasmus|Desiderius Erasmus]]. They are also the text type used in most [[Reformation|Protestant denominations]] consistently throughout history before [[Constantin von Tischendorf|the 19th century]] [[Westcott-Hort|adoption of]] the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian priority]] position within mainstream [[Biblical criticism]]. 

Stanley Porter explains, "The Textus Receptus is any form of the Greek text that goes back to the edition of Erasmus and the several late manuscripts he used. The Textus Receptus is a more restricted and limited form of Byzantine text, but it is not the Byzantine text as found in the edition of Robinson and Pierpont, or the Majority text found in the edition of Hodges and Farstad."<ref>Stanley Porter, How We Got the New Testament (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Bker Academic, 2013).</ref> Manuscripts of the [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine family]] represent the vast majority of the 5700 manuscripts that have currently been found and collated, no two of which are identical. These are now generally thought to represent a less original text than the Alexandrian text-type, but were the predominant text-type available to Erasmus.

{{See also|Novum Instrumentum omne|Editio Regia}} 
 
Erasmus had been working for years on two projects: a collation of Greek texts and a fresh Latin New Testament. In 1512, he began his work on the Latin New Testament. He collected all the Vulgate manuscripts he could find to create a critical edition. Then he polished the Latin, declaring, "It is only fair that Paul should address the Romans in somewhat better Latin."<ref>"Epistle 695" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus Vol. 5: Letters 594 to 841, 1517-1518'' (tr. [[Roger Mynors|R.A.B. Mynors]] and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated by James K. McConica; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 172.</ref> In the earlier phases of the project, he never mentioned a Greek text: "My mind is so excited at the thought of emending Jerome’s text, with notes, that I seem to myself inspired by some god. I have already almost finished emending him by collating a large number of ancient manuscripts, and this I am doing at enormous personal expense."<ref>"Epistle 273" in Collected ''Works of Erasmus Vol. 2: Letters 142 to 297, 1501-1514'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated Wallace K. Ferguson; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 253.</ref>

[[File:ErasmusText LastPage Rev22 8 21.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The last page of the Erasmian New Testament (Rev 22:8-21)]]
While his intentions for publishing a fresh Latin translation are clear, it is less clear why he included the Greek text. Though some speculate that he intended on producing a critical Greek text or that he wanted to beat the [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Complutensian Polyglot]] into print, there is no evidence to support this. Rather his motivation may have been simpler: he included the Greek text to prove the superiority of his Latin version. He wrote, "There remains the New Testament translated by me, with the Greek facing, and notes on it by me."<ref>"Epistle 305" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus. Vol. 3: Letters 298 to 445, 1514-1516'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated by James K. McConica; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 32.</ref> He further demonstrated the reason for the inclusion of the Greek text when defending his work: "But one thing the facts cry out, and it can be clear, as they say, even to a blind man, that often through the translator's clumsiness or inattention the Greek has been wrongly rendered; often the true and genuine reading has been corrupted by ignorant scribes, which we see happen every day, or altered by scribes who are half-taught and half-asleep."<ref>"Epistle 337" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus'' Vol. 3, 134.</ref> Erasmus' new work was published by [[Johann Froben|Froben]] of [[Basel]] in 1516, becoming the first published Greek New Testament, the ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]], diligenter ab Erasmo Rot. Recognitum et Emendatum''. He used manuscripts: [[Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 2|1]], [[Minuscule 2814|1<sup>rK</sup>]], [[Minuscule 2|2<sup>e</sup>]], [[Minuscule 2815|2<sup>ap</sup>]], [[Minuscule 2816|4<sup>ap</sup>]], [[Minuscule 7|7]], [[Minuscule 817 (Gregory-Aland)|817]].<ref name="W. Combs, 1996">W. W. Combs, ''Erasmus and the textus receptus'', DBSJ 1 (Spring 1996), 45.</ref> 
The second edition used the more familiar term ''Testamentum'' instead of ''Instrumentum,'' and eventually became a major source for Luther's [[German language|German]] translation. In the second edition (1519) Erasmus used also [[Minuscule 3]].

Typographical errors (attributed to the rush to complete the work) abounded in the published text. Erasmus also lacked a complete copy of the [[Book of Revelation]] and translated the last six verses back into Greek from the Latin [[Vulgate]] in order to finish his edition. Erasmus adjusted the text in many places to correspond with readings found in the Vulgate, or as quoted in the [[Church Fathers]]; consequently, although the Textus Receptus is classified by scholars as a late [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine]] text, it differs in nearly two thousand readings from the standard form of that text-type, as represented by the "[[Majority Text]]" of Hodges and Farstad (Wallace 1989). The edition was a sell-out commercial success and was reprinted in 1519, with most—though not all—the typographical errors corrected.<ref>Bruce M. Metzger, Bart D. Ehrman, ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2005, p. 145.</ref>

Erasmus had been studying Greek New Testament manuscripts for many years, in the Netherlands, France, England and Switzerland, noting their many variants, but had only six Greek manuscripts immediately accessible to him in Basel.<ref name="W. Combs, 1996"/> They all dated from the 12th Century or later, and only one came from outside the mainstream [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine]] tradition. Consequently, most modern scholars consider his text to be of dubious quality.<ref name="dubious">[[Bruce Metzger]] ''The Text of the New Testament'', p. 99</ref>

With the third edition of Erasmus' Greek text (1522) the [[Comma Johanneum]] was included, because "Erasmus chose to avoid any occasion for slander rather than persisting in philological accuracy", even though he remained "convinced that it did not belong to the original text of l John."<ref>H. J. de Jonge, [http://www.thescripturealone.com/De%20Jonge%20-%20Erasmus%20and%20the%20Comma%20Johanneum.pdf ''Erasmus and the Comma Johanneum'', Ephemerides Theologicae Lovanienses (1980), p. 385] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903143333/http://www.thescripturealone.com/De%20Jonge%20-%20Erasmus%20and%20the%20Comma%20Johanneum.pdf |date=2014-09-03 }}</ref> Popular demand for Greek New Testaments led to a flurry of further authorized and unauthorized editions in the early sixteenth century, almost all of which were based on Erasmus' work and incorporated his particular readings, although typically also making a number of minor changes of their own.<ref>S. P. Tregelles, [https://archive.org/stream/a609739200treguoft#page/n43/mode/2up ''An Account of the Printed Text of the Greek New Testament''], London 1854, p. 29.</ref>

[[File:NT Estienne 1551.jpg|thumb|right|180px|4th edition of New Testament of Robert Estienne]]
The overwhelming success of Erasmus' Greek New Testament completely overshadowed the Latin text upon which he had focused. Many other publishers produced their own versions of the Greek New Testament over the next several centuries. Rather than doing their own critical work, most just relied on the well-known Erasmian text.

[[Robert Estienne]], known as Stephanus (1503–1559), a printer from Paris, edited the Greek New Testament four times, in 1546, 1549, 1550 and 1551, the last in Geneva. The first two are called ''O mirificam''; the third edition is a masterpiece of typographical skill. It has critical apparatus in which quoted manuscripts referred to the text. Manuscripts were marked by symbols (from α to ις). He used ''Polyglotta Complutensis'' (symbolized by α) and 15 Greek manuscripts. Among these are included: [[Codex Bezae]], [[Codex Regius (New Testament)|Codex Regius]], minuscules [[Minuscule 4|4]], [[Minuscule 5|5]], [[Minuscule 6|6]], [[Minuscule 2817|2817]], [[Minuscule 8|8]], [[Minuscule 9|9]]. The first step towards modern Textual Criticism was made. The third edition is known as the [[Editio Regia]]. The edition of 1551 contains the Latin translation of [[Erasmus]] and the [[Vulgate]]. It is not nearly as fine as the other three and is exceedingly rare. It was in this edition that the division of the [[New Testament]] into verses was for the first time introduced.

The third edition of Estienne was used by [[Theodore Beza]] (1519–1605), who edited it nine times between 1565 and 1604. In the critical apparatus of the second edition he used the [[Codex Claromontanus]] and the Syriac New Testament published by Emmanuel Tremellius in 1569. Codex Bezae was twice referenced (as Codex Bezae and β' of Estienne).

The origin of the term ''Textus Receptus'' comes from the publisher's preface to the 1633 edition produced by [[Bonaventure Elzevir|Bonaventure]] and his nephew [[Abraham Elzevir]] who were partners in a printing business at Leiden. The preface reads, ''Textum ergo habes, nunc ab omnibus receptum: in quo nihil immutatum aut corruptum damus'', translated as, "so you hold the text, now received by all, in which (is) nothing corrupt." The two words ''textum'' and ''receptum'' were modified from the [[accusative]] to the [[nominative]] case to render ''textus receptus''. Over time, this term has been retroactively applied to Erasmus' editions, as his work served as the basis of the others.<ref>[[Bruce M. Metzger]], [[Bart D. Ehrman]], ''The Text Of The New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2005, p. 152.</ref>

== Textual criticism ==

[[John Mill (theologian)|John Mill]] (1645–1707) collated textual variants from 82 Greek manuscripts. In his ''Novum Testamentum Graecum, cum lectionibus variantibus MSS'' (Oxford 1707) he reprinted the unchanged text of the ''Editio Regia'', but in the index he enumerated 30,000 textual variants.<ref>T. Robertson, ''An Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament'', Nashville: Broadman, 1925, pp. 107-108.</ref>

Shortly after Mill published his edition, [[Daniel Whitby]] (1638–1725), attacked his work. He asserted that the text of the New Testament had never been corrupted and thus equated autographs with the Textus Receptus. He considered the 30,000 variants in Mill's edition a danger to Holy Scripture and called for defending the Textus Receptus against these variants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_sqAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Additional Annotations to the New Testament: With Seven Discourses; and an Appendix Entituled Examen Variantium Lectionum Johannis Millii, S.T.P. in Novum Testamentum|first=Daniel|last=Whitby|date=1 January 1710|publisher=W. Bowyer|via=Google Books}}</ref>

[[Johann Albrecht Bengel]] (1687–1752), in 1725 edited ''Prodromus Novi Testamenti Graeci Rectè Cautèque Adornandi'', in 1734 edited ''Novum Testamentum Graecum''. Bengel divided manuscripts into families and subfamilies. He favoured the principle of ''[[lectio difficilior potior]]'' ("the more difficult reading is the stronger").

[[Johann Jakob Wettstein]]'s apparatus was fuller than that of any previous editor. He introduced the practice of indicating the [[List of New Testament uncials|ancient manuscripts]] by capital Roman letters and the [[List of New Testament minuscules|later manuscripts]] by Arabic numerals. He published in Basel ''Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci'' (1731).

[[Johann Jakob Griesbach|J. J. Griesbach]] (1745–1812) combined the principles of Bengel and Wettstein. He enlarged the Apparatus by considering more [[List of New Testament Church Fathers|citations from the Fathers]], and various versions, such as the Gothic, the Armenian, and the [[Philoxenian]]. Griesbach distinguished a Western, an Alexandrian, and a Byzantine Recension.<ref>J. J. Griesbach, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=BLk9AAAAIAAJ&dq=graece&printsec=frontcover&source ''Novum Testamentum Graece'', (London 1809)]</ref> [[Christian Frederick Matthaei]] (1744–1811) was a Griesbach opponent.

[[Karl Lachmann]] (1793–1851) was the first who broke with the Textus Receptus. His object was to restore the text to the form in which it had been read in the ancient Church about A.D. 380. He used the oldest known Greek and Latin manuscripts.

Tischendorf's [[Editio Octava Critica Maior]] was based on [[Codex Sinaiticus]].

[[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]] published ''[[The New Testament in the Original Greek]]'' in 1881, in which they rejected what they considered to be the dated and inadequate Textus Receptus. The text is based mainly on [[Codex Vaticanus]] in the Gospels.<ref>[[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] & [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]], [https://archive.org/stream/newtestamentinor00westrich#page/n5/mode/2up The New Testament In The Original Greek (New York 1882)]</ref>

== Defence ==

Frederick von Nolan, a 19th-century historian and Greek and Latin scholar, spent 28 years attempting to trace the Textus Receptus to apostolic origins. He was an ardent advocate of the supremacy of the Textus Receptus over all other editions of the Greek New Testament, and he argued that the first editors of the printed Greek New Testament intentionally selected the texts they did because of their superiority and disregarded other texts, which represented other text-types because of their inferiority.

<blockquote>
It is not to be conceived that the original editors of the [Greek] New Testament were wholly destitute of plan in selecting those manuscripts, out of which they were to form the text of their printed editions. In the sequel it will appear, that they were not altogether ignorant of two classes of manuscripts; one of which contains the text which we have adopted from them; and the other that text which has been adopted by M. Griesbach.<ref name="text-types">''An Inquiry into the Integrity of the Greek Vulgate, or Received Text of the New Testament; in which the Greek Manuscripts are newly classed; the Integrity of the Authorised Text vindicated; and the Various Readings traced to their Origin'' (London, 1815), [http://mountainretreatorg.net/classics/inquiry1.html ch. 1]. The sequel mentioned in the text is Nolan's ''Supplement to an Inquiry into the Integrity of the Greek Vulgate, or Received Text of the New Testament; containing the Vindication of the Principles employed in its Defence'' (London, 1830).</ref>
</blockquote>

Regarding Erasmus, Nolan stated:
<blockquote>
Nor let it be conceived in disparagement of the great undertaking of Erasmus, that he was merely fortuitously right. Had he barely undertaken to perpetuate the tradition on which he received the sacred text he would have done as much as could be required of him, and more than sufficient to put to shame the puny efforts of those who have vainly labored to improve upon his design. [...] With respect to Manuscripts, it is indisputable that he was acquainted with every variety which is known to us, having distributed them into two principal classes, one of which corresponds with the Complutensian edition, the other with the Vatican manuscript. And he has specified the positive grounds on which he received the one and rejected the other.<ref name="varieties">''ibid.'', [http://mountainretreatorg.net/classics/inquiry5.html ch. 5]</ref> 
</blockquote>

The Textus Receptus was defended by [[John William Burgon]] in his ''The Revision Revised'' (1881), and also by Edward Miller in ''A Guide to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament'' (1886). Burgon supported his arguments with the opinion that the [[Codex Alexandrinus]] and [[Codex Ephraemi]], were older than the [[Codex Sinaiticus|Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Vaticanus]]; and also that the [[Peshitta]] translation into Syriac (which supports the Byzantine Text), originated in the 2nd century. Miller's arguments in favour of readings in the Textus Receptus were of the same kind.<ref>Edward Miller, ''A Guide to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament'' (The Dean Burgon Society Press: 2003), pp. 30-37. 57-59.</ref> However, both Burgon and Miller believed that, although the Textus Receptus was to be preferred to the Alexandrian Text, nevertheless it still required to be corrected in certain readings against the manuscript tradition of the Byzantine text. In this judgement they have been criticised by [[Edward F. Hills]]. Hills argues that the principle that God provides truth through scriptural revelation, necessarily also implies that God must ensure a preserved transmission of the correct revealed text, continuing into the Reformation era of biblical translation and printing. For Hills, the task of biblical scholarship is to identify the particular line of preserved transmission through which God is acting; a line which he sees in the specific succession of manuscript copying, textual correction and printing, which culminated in the Textus Receptus and the King James Bible. Hills argues that the principle of providentially preserved transmission guarantees that the printed Textus Receptus must be the closest text to the Greek autographs; and consequently he rejects readings in the Byzantine Majority Text where these are not maintained in the Textus Receptus. He goes so far as to conclude that Erasmus must have been providentially guided when he introduced Latin Vulgate readings into his Greek text;<ref>Edward F. Hills, ''King James Version Defended!'', pp. 199-200.</ref> and even argues for the authenticity of the Comma Johanneum.<ref>Edward F. Hills, ''King James Version Defended!'', pp. 209-213.</ref>

<blockquote>
Hence the true text is found not only in the text of the majority of the New Testament manuscripts but more especially in the Textus Receptus and in faithful translations of the Textus Receptus, such as the King James Version. In short, the Textus Receptus represents the God-guided revision of the majority text.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.febc.edu.sg/VPP12.htm|title=Far Eastern Bible College - A HISTORY OF MY DEFENCE OF THE KING JAMES VERSION|publisher=}}</ref> 
</blockquote>

Hills was the first textual critic to defend Textus Receptus. Although others have defended the TR per se, they are either not acknowledged textual critics (e.g., Theodore Letis, David Hocking) or their works are not on a scholarly level (e.g., Terence H. Brown or D. A. Waite).<ref>Daniel Wallace, ''The Majority Text Theory: History, Methods, and Critique'', in: ''The Text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research'', [[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|Wm. Eerdmans]] 1995, p. 301.</ref>

== Relationship to the Byzantine text ==
The Textus Receptus was established on a basis of the [[Byzantine text-type]], also called 'Majority text', and usually is identified with it by its followers.

[[Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener|F. H. A. Scrivener]] (1813–1891) remarked that Matt. 22:28, 23:25, 27:52, 28:3, 4, 19, 20; Mark 7:18, 19, 26, 10:1, 12:22, 15:46; Luke 1:16, 61, 2:43, 9:1, 15, 11:49; John 1:28, 10:8, 13:20 are under the influence of [[Minuscule 1]] ([[Caesarean text-type]]).<ref name = Scrivener183>[[Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener|F. H. A. Scrivener]], ''[[A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament]]'', ([[George Bell & Sons]]: London 1894), vol. 2, pp. 183-184.</ref> Scrivener showed that some texts were incorporated from the Vulgate (for example, Acts 9:6; Rev 17:4.8). 
[[Daniel B. Wallace]] enumerated that in 1,838 places (1005 are translatable) Textus Receptus differs from the Byzantine text-type.<ref>Daniel Wallace, "Some Second Thoughts on the Majority Text", Bibliotheca Sacra, July–September, 1989, p. 276.</ref>

[[John William Burgon|Dean Burgon]], one of the main supporters of the Textus Receptus, declared that the Textus Receptus needs correction.<ref>J. W. Burgon, ''The Revised Revision'' (London 1883), p. 548.</ref> He suggested 150 corrections in the ''Textus Receptus'' Gospel of Matthew alone.<ref>J. W. Burgon, ''Revised Revision'' (London 1883), p. 242.</ref>

: Matthew 10:8 it has Alexandrian reading νεκροὺς ἐγείρετε (''raise the dead'') omitted by the Byzantine text.<ref>NA26, p. 24.</ref><ref>J. W. Burgon, ''The Revised Revision'', p. 108; Edward Miller, ''Textual Commentary Upon the Holy Gospels'', p. 75.</ref>
: [[Acts 20:28]] it has Alexandrian reading τοῦ Θεοῦ (''of God'') instead of Byzantine τοῦ Κυρίου καὶ Θεοῦ (''of the Lord and God'').
