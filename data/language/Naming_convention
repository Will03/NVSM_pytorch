A '''naming convention''' is a [[convention (norm)|convention]] (generally agreed scheme) for naming things. Conventions differ in their intents, which may include to:
* Allow useful information to be deduced from the names based on regularities.  For instance, in [[Manhattan]], streets are consecutively numbered; with East-West streets called "Streets" and North-South streets called "Avenues".
* Show relationships, and in most personal naming conventions
* Ensure that each name is unique for same scope

==Use cases==
Well-chosen naming conventions aid the casual user in navigating and searching larger structures. Several areas where naming conventions are commonly used include:
* In [[Astronomical naming conventions|astronomy]], '''[[planetary nomenclature]]'''
* In [[classics]], '''[[Roman naming convention]]s'''
* In [[computer programming]], '''[[Naming conventions (programming)|identifier naming convention]]s'''
* In [[computer networking]], '''[[naming scheme]]'''
* In humans, '''[[Personal name|naming offspring]]'''
* In industry, '''[[product naming convention]]s'''
* In the sciences, '''[[systematic name]]s''' for a variety of things

==Examples==
Examples of naming conventions may include:
* Children's names may be alphabetical by birth order.  In some Asian cultures, siblings commonly share a [[middle name]].  In many cultures the son is usually named after the father or grandfather.<ref>[http://www.sca.org/heraldry/laurel/names/jewish.html Jewish Naming Convention in Angevin England.Eleazar ha-Levi]</ref> In other cultures, the name may include the place of residence.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.naha.stolaf.edu/naming.htm|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050310131321/http://www.naha.stolaf.edu/naming.htm|title= Norwegian Naming Convention|archivedate= 10 March 2005|work= stolaf.edu}}</ref> [[Roman naming convention]] denotes social rank.
* Developers of database schemas, program-name terminology and ontologies may apply a common set of labeling conventions for naming representational entities in their representational artefacts, i.e. conventions outlined or endorsed by terminology-regulatory bodies or by policy providers such as ISO or the [[OBO Foundry]].
* The names of universities can commemorate founders, patrons or relevant monarchs: note for example [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], [[Victoria University of Wellington]], or [[Johns Hopkins University]]. A Latinate version confers extra class - note ''Alma Mater Rudolphina'' for the [[University of Vienna]] or ''Universitas Complutensis'' for the [[Complutense University of Madrid]].
* Large corporate, university, or government campuses may name rooms within their buildings to help orient tenants and visitors.
* Products. [[Automobile]]s typically have a binomial name, a "make" (manufacturer) and a "model", in addition to a model year.  Computers, and computer programs, often have increasing numbers in their names to signify the successive generations.
* School courses:  an abbreviation for the subject area and then a number ordered by increasing level of difficulty.
* Shipping lines often use a distinct naming convention to make their ships more recognisable and their names easier to remember.
* Virtually all organizations that assign names or numbers follow some convention in generating these identifiers (e.g. [[phone number]]s, [[bank account]]s, government IDs, [[credit cards]], etc.).
