'''Translation studies''' is an academic interdiscipline dealing with the systematic study of the theory, description and application of [[translation]], [[interpreting]], and [[Language localisation|localization]]. As an interdiscipline, Translation Studies borrows much from the various fields of study that support translation. These include [[comparative literature]], [[computer science]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[philology]], [[philosophy]], [[semiotics]], and [[terminology]].

The term ''translation studies'' was coined by the Amsterdam-based American scholar [[James S. Holmes]] in his paper "The name and nature of translation studies",<ref>[[James S. Holmes|Holmes, James S.]] (1972/1988). ''The Name and Nature of Translation Studies''. In Holmes, ''Translated! Papers on Literary Translation and Translation Studies'', Amsterdam: Rodopi, pp. 67–80.</ref> which is considered a foundational statement for the discipline.<ref>Munday, Jeremy. 2008. ''Introducing Translation Studies''. London and New York: Routledge. pp. 4</ref> In English, writers occasionally use the term '''translatology''' (and less commonly '''traductology''') to refer to translation studies, and the corresponding French term for the discipline is usually ''traductologie'' (as in the [http://www.societe-francaise-traductologie.com/ Société Française de Traductologie]). In the United States there is a preference for the term ''Translation and Interpreting Studies'' (as in the [http://www.atisa.org/ American Translation and Interpreting Studies Association]), although European tradition includes interpreting within translation studies (as in the [[European Society for Translation Studies]]).

==History==
===Early studies===
Historically, translation studies has long been ''prescriptive'' (telling translators how to translate), to the point that discussions of translation that were not prescriptive were generally not considered to be about translation at all. When historians of translation studies trace early Western thought about translation, for example, they most often set the beginning at [[Cicero]]'s remarks on how he used translation from Greek to Latin to improve his oratorical abilities—an early description of what [[Jerome]] ended up calling [[sense-for-sense translation]]. The descriptive history of interpreters in Egypt provided by [[Herodotus]] several centuries earlier is typically not thought of as translation studies—presumably because it does not tell translators how to translate. In [[China]], the discussion on [[Chinese translation theory|how to translate]] originated with the translation of [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhist sutras]] during the [[Han Dynasty]].

===Calls for an academic discipline===
In 1958, at the Second Congress of Slavists in Moscow, the debate between linguistic and literary approaches to translation reached a point where it was proposed that the best thing might be to have a separate science that was able to study all forms of translation, without being wholly within Linguistics or wholly within Literary Studies.<ref>Cary, Edmond. 1959. '"Andréi Fédorov. Introduction à la théorie de la traduction." Babel 5, p. 19n.</ref> Within Comparative Literature, translation workshops were promoted in the 1960s in some American universities like the [[University of Iowa]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]].<ref>Munday, Jeremy. 2008. ''Introducing Translation Studies''. London and New York: Routledge. pp. 8</ref>
During the 1950s and 1960s, systematic linguistic-oriented studies of translation began to appear. In 1958, the French linguists Jean-Paul Vinay and Jean Darbelnet carried out a contrastive comparison of French and English.<ref>Vinay, Jean-Paul and J.Darbelnet. 1958/1995. ''Comparative Stylistics of French and English: A Methodology for Translation''. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins.</ref> In 1964, [[Eugene Nida]] published ''Toward a Science of Translating'', a manual for [[Bible translation]] influenced to some extent by [[Zellig Harris|Harris]]'s [[transformational grammar]].<ref>Nida, Eugene. 1964. ''Toward a Science of Translating''. Leiden: EJ Brill.</ref> In 1965, [[J. C. Catford]] theorized translation from a linguistic perspective.<ref>Catford, J.C., (1965). ''A Linguistic Theory of Translation''. London: Longman.</ref> In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Czech scholar [[Jiří Levý]] and the Slovak scholars [[Anton Popovič]] and František Miko worked on the stylists of literary translation.<ref>[[Jiří Levý|Levý, Jiří]] (1967). ''Translation as a Decision Process''. In ''To Honor Roman Jakobson''. The Hague: Mouton, II, pp.&nbsp;1171–1182.</ref>

These initial steps toward research on literary translation were collected in James S. Holmes' paper at the Third International Congress of Applied Linguistics held in [[Copenhagen]] in 1972. In that paper, "The name and nature of translation studies", Holmes asked for the consolidation of a separate discipline and proposed a classification of the field. A visual "map" of Holmes' proposal would later be presented by [[Gideon Toury]] in his 1995 ''Descriptive Translation Studies and beyond''.<ref>[[Gideon Toury|Toury, Gideon]] (1995). ''Descriptive Translation Studies and beyond''. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins.</ref>

Prior to the 1990s, translation scholars tended to form particular schools of thought, particularly within the prescriptive, descriptive, and Skopos paradigms. Since the "cultural turn" in the 1990s, the discipline has tended to divide into separate fields of inquiry, where research projects run parallel to each other, borrowing methodologies from each other and from other academic disciplines.

==Schools of thought==
The main schools of thought on the level of research have tended to cluster around key theoretical concepts, most of which have become objects of debate.

===Equivalence===
Through to the 1950s and 1960s, discussions in translation studies tended to concern how best to attain "equivalence". The term "equivalence" had two distinct meanings, corresponding to different schools of thought. In the Russian tradition, "equivalence" was usually a one-to-one correspondence between linguistic forms, or a pair of authorized technical terms or phrases, such that "equivalence" was opposed to a range of "substitutions". However, in the French tradition of Vinay and Darbelnet, drawing on [[Charles Bally|Bally]], "equivalence" was the attainment of equal functional value, generally requiring ''changes'' in form. [[J. C. Catford|Catford]]'s notion of equivalence in 1965 was as in the French tradition. In the course of the 1970s, Russian theorists adopted the wider sense of "equivalence" as something ''resulting'' from linguistic transformations.

At about the same time, the ''[[The Interpretive Theory of Translation|Interpretive Theory of Translation]]''<ref>Lederer Marianne (2003). ''Translation – The Interpretive Model'', Manchester: St. Jerome.</ref> introduced the notion of deverbalized sense into translation studies, drawing a distinction between word correspondences and sense equivalences, and showing the difference between dictionary definitions of words and phrases (word correspondences) and the sense of texts or fragments thereof in a given context (sense equivalences).

The discussions of equivalence accompanied typologies of translation solutions (also called "procedures", "techniques" or "strategies"), as in Fedorov (1953) and Vinay and Darbelnet (1958). In 1958 Loh Dianyang's ''Translation: Its Principles and Techniques'' (英汉翻译理论与技巧) drew on Fedorov and English linguistics to present a typology of translation solutions between Chinese and English.

In these traditions, discussions of the ways to attain equivalence have mostly been prescriptive and have been related to translator training.

===Descriptive translation studies===
Descriptive translation studies <!-- I deleted the parenthesis because the term "descriptive translation studies" was not coined by Toury. It goes back to at least Holmes' 1975 essay, "The Name and Nature of Translation Studies", where the term "descriptive translation studies" is used: "The two branches of pure translation studies concerning themselves with these objectives can be designated descriptive translation studies (DTS) or translation description (TD) and theoretical translation studies (ThTS) or translation theory (TTh)." - Holmes, James S 1988 (1975). "The Name and Nature of Translation Studies". In: James S Holmes 1988. Translated!: Papers on Literary Translation and Translation Studies. Amsterdam: Rodopi, pp. 66-80. https://www.tau.ac.il/tarbut/tirgum/holmes75.htm. -->aims at building an empirical descriptive discipline, to fill one section of the Holmes map. The idea that scientific methodology could be applicable to cultural products had been developed by the Russian Formalists in the early years of the 20th century, and had been recovered by various researchers in [[comparative literature|Comparative Literature]]. It was now applied to literary translation. Part of this application was the theory of polysystems (Even-Zohar 1990<ref>Even-Zohar, I. (1990b) "Polysystem theory," Poetics Today 11(1): 9-26 LINK</ref>) in which translated literature is seen as a sub-system of the receiving or target literary system. Gideon Toury bases his theory on the need to consider translations "facts of the target culture" for the purposes of research. The concepts of "manipulation"<ref>Hermans, T. (ed.) .1985. 'The Manipulation of Literature: Studies in Literary Translation'. London and Sydney: Croom Helm.</ref> and "patronage"<ref>Lefevere, A. 1992. 'Translation, Rewriting, and the Manipulation of Literary Fame'. London and New York: Routledge.</ref> have also been developed in relation to literary translations.

===''Skopos'' theory===
Another paradigm shift in translation theory can be dated from 1984 in Europe. That year saw the publication of two books in German: ''Foundation for a General Theory of Translation'' by [[Katharina Reiss]] (also written Reiß) and [[Hans Vermeer]],<ref>[[Katharina Reiss|Reiss, Katharina]] (1989). "Text Types, Translation Types and Translation Assessment." In: Chesterman, Andrew (ed.) (1989). ''Readings in Translation Theory''. Helsinki: Finn Lectura</ref> and ''Translatorial Action'' (Translatorisches Handeln) by Justa Holz-Mänttäri.<ref>Pym, Anthony. 2008. Exploring Translation Theories. London and New York: Routledge. 47</ref> From these two came what is known as   [[Skopos theory]], which gives priority to the purpose to be fulfilled by the translation instead of prioritizing equivalence.

===Cultural translation===
The cultural turn meant still another step forward in the development of the discipline. It was sketched by [[Susan Bassnett]] and [[André Lefevere]] in ''Translation - History - Culture'', and quickly represented by the exchanges between translation studies and other area studies and concepts: [[gender studies]], cannibalism, post-colonialism<ref>[[Douglas Robinson (academic)|Robinson, Douglas]]. (1997). ''Translation and Empire: Postcolonial Theories Explained.'' Manchester: St. Jerome.</ref> or cultural studies, among others.

The concept of ''cultural translation'' largely ensues from [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]]'s reading of [[Salman Rushdie]] in ''The Location of Culture''.<ref>London and New York: Routledge, 1994.</ref> [[Cultural translation]] is a concept used in [[cultural studies]] to denote the process of transformation, linguistic or otherwise, in a given [[culture]]. The concept uses linguistic translation as a tool or metaphor in analyzing the nature of transformation and interchange in cultures. "Nonetheless, despite the fact that translation brings cultures nearer, in each translation, there will be a definite deformation between cultures.".{{clarify|reason=what does this quotation refer to?|date=September 2017}}

==Fields of inquiry==
===Translation history===
Translation history concerns the history of translators as a professional and social group, as well as the history of translations as indicators of the way cultures develop, interact, and may die. Some principles for translation history have been proposed by Lieven D'hulst<ref>D'hulst, L. (2014). Essais d'histoire de la traduction. Avatars de Janus. Paris: Classiques Garnier.</ref> and [[Anthony Pym|Pym]].<ref>Pym, Anthony. 1998/2014. Method in Translation History. London and New York: Routledge.</ref> Major projects in translation history have included the [https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/o/oxford-history-of-literary-translation-in-english-hlte/?cc=es&lang=en& Oxford History of Literary Translation in English] and [http://editions-verdier.fr/livre/histoire-des-traductions-en-langue-francaise/ Histoire des traductions en langue française].

Historical anthologies of translation theories have been compiled by [[Douglas Robinson (academic)|Robinson]] (2002)<ref>Robinson, Douglas, ed. (2002), ''Translation Theory From Herodotus to Nietzsche''. Manchester: St. Jerome.</ref> for Western theories up to Nietzsche; by D'hulst (1990)<ref>D'hulst, L. (1990). Cent ans de théorie française de la traduction: de Batteux à Littré (1748-1847). Lille: Presses Universitaires du Septentrion.</ref> for French theories, 1748–1847; by Santoyo (1987)<ref>Santoyo, Julio-César. 1987. Teoria y critica de la traduccion : antologia. Bellaterra: Publicacions de la Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.</ref> for the Spanish tradition; by [[Edward Balcerzan]] (1977)<ref>[[Edward Balcerzan]], ed., ''Pisarze polscy o sztuce przekładu, 1440–1974: Antologia'' (Polish Writers on the Art of Translation, 1440–1974: an Anthology), Poznań, Wydawnictwo Poznańskie, 1977.</ref> for the Polish experience, 1440–1974; and by [[Martha Cheung|Cheung]] (2006)<ref>Cheung, Martha. 2006. Anthology on Chinese Discourse on Translation. Manchester: Saint Jerome.</ref> for Chinese.

===Sociologies of translation===
The sociology of translation includes the study of who translators are, what their forms of work are (workplace studies), and what data on translations can say about the movements of ideas between languages.

===Postcolonial translation studies===
Postcolonial studies look at translations between a metropolis and former colonies, or within complex former colonies.<ref>Robinson, Douglas. 1997. Translation and Empire: Postcolonial Approaches Explained. Manchester: St. Jerome.</ref> They radically question the assumption that translation occurs between cultures and languages that are radically separated.

===Gender studies===
Gender studies look at the sexuality of translators,<ref>von Flotow, Luise. 2011. Translating women. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press.</ref> at the gendered nature of the texts they translate,<ref>Simon, Sherry. 1996. Gender in translation. London and New York: Routledge; Von Flotow, Luise. 1997. Translation and gender: translating in the "era of feminism" . Manchester: St. Jerome;</ref> at the possibly gendered translation processes employed, and at the gendered metaphors used to describe translation. Pioneering studies are by Luise von Flotow, {{Interlanguage link multi|Sherry Simon|de}}, and Keith Harvey.<ref>Harvey, Keith. 1998. "Translating Camp Talk," in Translation and Minority, ed. Lawrence Venuti (Manchester,: St. Jerome), 295-320.</ref> The effacement or inability to efface threatening forms of same-sex sexuality is a topic taken up, when for instance ancient writers are translated by Renaissance thinkers in a Christian context<ref>Reeser, Todd W. 2016. ''Setting Plato Straight: Translating Ancient Sexuality in the Renaissance''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>

===Ethics===
In the field of ethics, much discussed publications have been the essays of [[Antoine Berman]] and [[Lawrence Venuti]] that differ in some aspects but agree on the idea of emphasizing the differences between source and target language and culture when translating. Both are interested in how the "cultural other [...] can best preserve [...] that otherness".<ref>[[Lawrence Venuti|Venuti, Lawrence]] (1995). ''The Translator's Invisibility: A History of Translation''. London and New York: Routledge. P. 306. ([http://www.freewebs.com/dennis_rusu/the%20translator 's%20invisibility.%20history%20of%20translation.pdf Read full version here]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }})</ref> In more recent studies scholars have applied [[Emmanuel Levinas]]’ philosophical work on ethics and subjectivity on this issue.<ref>Larkosh, Christopher (2004): "Levinas, Latin American Thought and the Futures of Translational Ethics." [[TTR: traduction, terminologie, rédaction]].  Vol. 17, nº 2, 27-44</ref> As his publications have been interpreted in different ways, various conclusions on his concept of ethical responsibility have been drawn from this. Some have come to the assumption that the idea of translation itself could be ethically doubtful, while others receive it as a call for considering the relationship between [[author]] or text and [[Translation#Translators|translator]] as more interpersonal, thus making it an equal and reciprocal process.

Parallel to these studies the general recognition of the translator's responsibility has increased. More and more translators and interpreters are being seen as active participants in geopolitical conflicts, which raises the question of how to act ethically independent from their own identity or judgement. This leads to the conclusion that translating and interpreting cannot be considered solely as a process of [[language transfer]], but also as socially and politically directed activities.<ref>Inghilleri, Moira; Maier, Carol. 2001. "Ethics." In: ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies.'' New York & London: Routledge.</ref>

There is general agreement on the need for an ethical [[Ethical code#Code of practice (professional ethics)|code of practice]] providing some guiding principles to reduce uncertainties and improve professionalism, as having been stated in other disciplines (for example [[military medical ethics]] or [[legal ethics]]). However, as there is still no clear understanding of the concept of [[ethics]] in this field, opinions about the particular appearance of such a code vary considerably.

===Audiovisual translation studies===
Audiovisual translation studies (AVT) is concerned with [[translation]] that takes place in audio and/or visual settings, such as the cinema, television, video games and also some live events such as opera performances.<ref>Pedersen, Jan. 2010. "Audiovisual Translation – In General and in Scandinavia".</ref> The common denominator for studies in this field is that translation is carried out on multiple semiotic systems, as the translated texts (so-called polysemiotic texts<ref>Gottlieb, Henrik. 2001. Screen Translation: Six studies in subtitling, dubbing and voice-over.</ref>) have messages that are conveyed through more than one [[semiotic]] channel, i.e. not just through the written or spoken word, but also via sound and/or images.<ref>Pérez-González. Luis. 2014. Audiovisual Translation – Theories, Methods and Issues. London & New York: Routledge</ref> The main translation modes under study are [[subtitling]], [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] and [[voice-over]], but also [[surtitling]] for the opera and theatre.<ref>Vervecken, Anika. 2012. "Surtitling for the Stage and Directors’ Attitude: Room for Change".</ref>

Media accessibility studies is often considered a part of this field as well,<ref>Remael, Aline, Pilar Orero & Mary Carroll. 2012. Audiovisual Translation and Media Accessibility at the Crossroads: Media for All 3. Amsterdam & New York: Rodopi.</ref> with [[Audio description | audio description for the blind and partially sighted]] and [[subtitling#SDH|subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing]] being the main objects of study. In audiovisual translation studies, the various conditions and constraints imposed by the different media forms and translation modes influence how translation is carried out, and this often at the heart of most studies of the product or process of AVT. Many researchers in the field of AVT Studies are organized in the European Association for Studies in Screen Translation ([[ESIST]]), as are many practitioners in the field.

===Non-professional translation===
Non-professional translation refers to the translation activities performed by translators who are not working professionally, usually in ways made possible by the Internet.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal|last1=O'Hagan|first1=Minako|title=Community Translation: Translation as a social activity and its possible consequences in the advent of Web 2.0 and beyond|journal=Linguistica Antverpiensia|date=2011|volume=10|url=https://lans-tts.uantwerpen.be/index.php/LANS-TTS/article/view/275}}</ref> These practices have mushroomed with the recent [[democratization of technology]] and the popularization of the Internet. Volunteer translation initiatives have emerged all around the world, and deal with the translations of various types of written and multimedia products.

Normally, it is not required for volunteers to have been trained in translation, but trained translators could also participate, such as the case of Translators without Borders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Translators without Borders|url=https://twb.translationcenter.org/}}</ref>

Depending on the feature that each scholar considers the most important, different terms have been used to label ''non-professional translation''. O'Hagan has used ''user-generated translation'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Hagan|first1=Minako|title=. Evolution of User-generated Translation: Fansubs, Translation Hacking and Crowdsourcing|journal=Journal of Internationalisation and Localisation|date=2009|volume=1|pages=94–121}}</ref> ''[[fan translation]]''<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Hagan|first1=Minako|title=Fan Translation Networks: An Accidental Training Environment?|journal=Translator and Interpreter Training: Methods and Debates|pages=158–183}}</ref> and ''community translation''.<ref name="auto"/> Fernández-Costales and Jiménez-Crespo prefer ''collaborative translation'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fernández-Costales|first1=Alberto|title=Collaborative Translation Revisited: Exploring the Rationale and the Motivation for Volunteer Translation|journal=Forum - International Journal of Translation|date=2012|volume=1|issue=10|pages=115–142}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jiménez-Crespo|first1=Miguel Ángel|title=Collaborative and volunteer translation and interpreting|journal=Researching Translation and Interpreting}}</ref> while Pérez-González labels it ''amateur subtitling''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pérez-González|first1=Luis|title=Amateur subtitling as immaterial labour in digital media culture: An emerging paradigm of civic engagement|journal=Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies|date=2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=157–175}}</ref> Pym proposes that the fundamental difference between this type of translation and professional translation relies on monetary reward, and he suggests it should be called ''volunteer translation''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pym|first1=Anthony|title=Translation research terms: a tentative glossary for moments of perplexity and dispute|journal=Translation Research Projects 3|date=2011|pages=75–110}}</ref>

Some of the most popular fan-controlled non-professional translation practices are [[Fansubbing]], [[Fandubbing]], [[ROM hacking]] or [[Fan translation of video games]], and [[Scanlation]].  These practices are mostly supported by a strong and consolidated fan base, although larger non-professional translation projects normally apply [[Crowdsourcing]] models and are controlled by companies or organizations. Since 2008 [[Facebook]] has used [[crowdsourcing]] to have its website translated by its users, and [[TED conference]] has set up the open translation project TED Translators<ref>{{cite web|title=TED Open Translation Project|url=https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-translators}}</ref> in which volunteers use the Amara<ref>{{cite web|title=Amara|url=https://amara.org/}}</ref> platform to create subtitles online for TED talks.

===Localization===
Studies of [[language localization|localization]] concern the way the contemporary language industries translate and adapt ("localize") technical texts across languages, tailoring them for a specific "[[Locale (computer software)|locale]]" (a target location defined by language variety and various cultural parameters). Localization usually concerns software, product documentation, websites and [[Game localization|video games]], where the technological component is key.

A key concept in localization is [[localization and internationalization|internationalization]], in which the start product is stripped of its culture-specific features in such a way that it can be simultaneously localized into several languages.

===Translator education===
===Interpreting Studies===
The discipline of Interpreting Studies is often referred to as the sister of Translation Studies. This is due to the similarities between the two disciplines, consisting in the transfer of ideas from one language into another. Indeed, interpreting as an activity was long seen as a specialized form of translation, before scientifically founded Interpreting Studies emancipated gradually from Translation Studies in the second half of the 20th century. While they were strongly oriented towards the theoretic framework of Translation Studies,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kade|first1=Otto|title=Zufall und Gesätzmäßigkeit in der Übersetzung|date=1968|publisher=Leipzig Verl. Enzyklopädie|location=Leipzig}}</ref> Interpreting Studies have always been concentrating on the practical and pedagogical aspect of the activity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seleskovitch|first1=Danica|last2=Lederer|first2=Marianne|title=Pédagogie Raisonnée de l'Interprétation|date=1989|publisher=Didier Érudition|location=Brussels}}</ref> This led to the steady emancipation of the discipline and the consecutive development of a separate theoretical framework based - as are Translation Studies - on interdisciplinary premises. Interpreting Studies have developed several approaches and undergone various paradigm shifts,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pöchhacker|first1=Franz|title=The turns of Interpreting Studies|journal=Efforts and Models in Interpreting and Translation Research: A tribute to Daniel Gile|date=2009|issue=ed. Chesterman/andrew, Gerzymisch-Arbogast/Heidrun|pages=25–46}}</ref> leading to the most recent surge of sociological studies of interpreters and their work(ing conditions).

===Cognition and process studies===
===Translation technologies===

==Future prospects==
Translation studies has developed alongside the growth in translation schools and courses at the university level. In 1995, a study of 60 countries revealed there were 250 bodies at university level offering courses in translation or interpreting.<ref>Caminade, M. and A. Pym. 1995. "Les formations en traduction et interpretation. Essai de recensement mondial". In ''Traduire''. Paris: Société Française des Traducteurs</ref> In 2013, the same database listed 501 translator-training institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est-translationstudies.org/resources/tti/tti.htm|title=Translator-Training Institutions|author=|date=|website=www.est-translationstudies.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> Accordingly, there has been a growth in [http://usuaris.tinet.cat/apym/conferences/index.html conferences on translation], [http://www.est-translationstudies.org/resources/journals_index.html translation journals] and translation-related publications. The visibility acquired by translation has also led to the development of national and international associations of translation studies. Ten of these associations formed the [http://www.est-translationstudies.org/news/2016_INTISA.html International Network of Translation and Interpreting Studies Associations (INTISA)] in September 2016.

The growing variety of paradigms is mentioned as one of the possible sources of conflict in the discipline. As early as 1999, the conceptual gap between non-essentialist and empirical approaches came up for debate at the Vic Forum on Training Translators and Interpreters: New Directions for the Millennium. The discussants, Rosemary Arrojo and [[Andrew Chesterman]], explicitly sought common shared ground for both approaches.<ref>Chesterman, A. and R. Arrojo (2000), ‘Shared ground in translation studies’, ''Target'' 12.1:151–60.</ref>

Interdisciplinarity has made the creation of new paradigms possible, as most of the developed theories grew from contact with other disciplines like linguistics, comparative literature, cultural studies, philosophy, sociology or historiography. At the same time, it might have provoked the fragmentation of translation studies as a discipline on its own right.<ref>Gile, Daniel. 2004 "Translation research versus interpreting research: kinship, differences and prospects for partnership". In Christina Schäffner (ed.), ‘Translation Research and Interpreting Research: Traditions, Gaps and Synergies’. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters. pp. 10–34.</ref>

A second source of conflict rises from the breach between theory and practice. As the prescriptivism of the earlier studies gives room to descriptivism and theorization, professionals see less applicability of the studies. At the same time, university research assessment places little if any importance on translation practice.<ref>Munday 2010. p.15.</ref>

Translation studies has shown a tendency to broaden its fields of inquiry, and this trend may be expected to continue. This particularly concerns extensions into [http://www.adaptation.uk.com/ adaptation studies], intralingual translation, translation between semiotic systems (image to text to music, for example), and translation as the form of all interpretation and thus of all understanding, as suggested in [[On Linguistic Aspects of Translation|the work of Roman Jakobson]].
