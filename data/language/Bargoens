'''''Bargoens''''' {{IPA-nl|bɑrˈɣuns|}} is a form of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] [[slang]], more specifically, it is a [[Cant (language)|cant]] language that arose in the 17th century, and was used by criminals, tramps and travelling salesmen as a secret code, like Spain's ''[[Germanía]]'' or French ''[[Argot]]''. 

However, the word ''Bargoens'' usually refers to the [[thieves' cant]] spoken in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. The actual slang varied greatly from place to place; often ''Bargoens'' denotes the variety from the [[Holland|Holland region]] in the [[Netherlands]]. While many words from Bargoens have faded into obscurity, others have become part of standard Dutch (but are more often used in the "Hollandic" than in other Dutch dialects). ''Hufter'' (jerk), ''gappen'' (to steal) and ''poen'' (money) are examples of words now common in Dutch. As is the case for most thieves' languages, many of the words from ''Bargoens'' are either insults or concern money, crime or sex.

Due to the historically large number of [[Jews in Amsterdam]], Bargoens has many [[Yiddish]] [[loanword]]s. Examples are ''sjacheren'' (to barter), ''mesjogge'' (crazy), ''jatten'' (hands, to steal), ''gabber'' (buddy, friend), ''tof'' (great), ''hachelen'' (to eat).

The name of this cant is close to ''baragouin'', which means "[[jargon]]" in [[French language|French]]. It is supposed to have been derived either from the Breton words ''bara+gwin'' (bread+wine) or from ''Bourgondisch'' ('Burgundish', i.e. [the language] from Burgundy).
