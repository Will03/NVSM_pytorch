The economic, social, and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding such issues as maintaining [[American ethnicity|ethnic homogeneity]], workers for employers versus jobs for non-immigrants, settlement patterns, impact on upward [[socioeconomic mobility in the United States|social mobility]], [[Crime in the United States|crime]], and voting behavior.

Prior to 1965, policies such as the [[National Origins Formula|national origins formula]] limited immigration and [[naturalization]] opportunities for people from areas outside [[Western Europe]].

Research suggests that immigration to the United States is beneficial to the U.S. economy.

==History==
{{Main|History of immigration to the United States}}
[[File:Welcome to the land of freedom.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Immigrants on ocean steamer passing the Statue of Liberty, New York City, 1887]]
American immigration history can be viewed in four epochs: the colonial period, the mid-19th century, the start of the 20th century, and post-1965. Each period brought distinct national groups, races and ethnicities to the United States.

===Colonial period===
During the 17th century, approximately 400,000 English people migrated to Colonial America.<ref name="virtualjamestown"/> However, only half stayed permanently. From 1700 to 1775 between 400-500,000 immigrated. Only 45,000 English supposedly immigrated in the period 1701 to 1775 (on Butler, Becoming America, The Revolution before 1776, 2000, p.&nbsp;34-35 {{ISBN|0-674-00091-9}}), a figure questioned as too low (The Oxford History of the British Empire, The Eighteenth Century, Ed. P. J. Marshall, p.&nbsp;3 {{ISBN|0-19-820563-5}} the number  given is at 80,000 less 29,000 Welsh which seems strange to the author, James Horn; Duncan also regards this as a "mystery") not including the 50,000-120,000 convicts transported, most of whom were English: the rest, 400-450,000 were Scots, Scots-Irish from Ulster, Germans and Swiss, French Huguenots, and involuntarily 350,000 Africans (Encyclopedia of the Colonial and Revolutionary America, 1996 p.&nbsp;200-202 {{ISBN|0-306-80687-8}}; Jon Butler, Becoming America, The Revolution before 1776, 2000, pp.&nbsp;16–49 {{ISBN|0-674-00091-9}}). Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America during the 17th and 18th centuries arrived as [[indentured servant]]s.<ref name="mertsahinoglu" /> They numbered 350,000 (Encyclopedia, p.&nbsp;202). The European populations of the Middle Colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware were ethnically very mixed, the English constituting only 30 in Pennsylvania, 40% in New Jersey to 45% in New York (numbered22 thousand or 18% in NY) (Duncan. op. cit. p.&nbsp;10). The mid-19th century saw an influx mainly from northern Europe from the same major ethnic groups as for the Colonial Period but with large numbers of Catholic Irish and Scandinavians added to the mix; the late 19th and early 20th-century immigrants were mainly from Southern and Eastern Europe, but there were also several million immigrants from Canada; post-1965 most came from Latin America and Asia.

Historians estimate that fewer than 1 million immigrants moved to the United States from Europe between 1600 and 1799.<ref name="history"/> By comparison, in the first federal census, in 1790, the population of the United States was enumerated to be 3,929,214.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/fast_facts/1790_fast_facts.html |title=History: 1790 Fast Facts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref>

===Early United States era===
The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] limited naturalization to "free white persons"; it was expanded to include blacks in the 1860s and Asians only in the 1950s.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics: African Americans and Asian Americans"/> This made the United States an outlier, since laws that made racial distinctions were uncommon in the world in the 18th Century.<ref>[[James Whitman | James Q. Whitman]], ""Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law," (Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 2017), p. 35</ref>

In the early years of the United States, immigration was fewer than 8,000 people a year,<ref name="americanheritage"/> including French refugees from the slave revolt in Haiti. After 1820, immigration gradually increased. From 1836 to 1914, over 30 million Europeans migrated to the United States.<ref name="tandfonline"/> The death rate on these transatlantic voyages was high, during which one in seven travelers died.<ref name="Dying and Death in Canada"/> In 1875, the nation passed its first immigration law, the [[Page Act of 1875]].<ref name="The real immigration scare tactics"/>
[[File:Ellis island 1902.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Immigrants arriving at [[Ellis Island]], 1902]]
After an initial wave of immigration from China following the [[California Gold Rush]], Congress passed a series of laws culminating in the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, banning virtually all immigration from China until the law's repeal in 1943. In the late 1800s, [[Asian immigration to the United States#First major wave of Asian immigration (1850s-1917)|immigration from other Asian countries]], especially to the West Coast, became more common.

===20th Century===
The peak year of European immigration was in 1907, when 1,285,349 persons entered the country.<ref name="houstonhistory"/> By 1910, 13.5 million immigrants were living in the United States.<ref name="google3"/> In 1921, the Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]], followed by the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. The 1924 Act was aimed at further restricting immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, particularly Jews, Italians, and Slavs, who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s, and consolidated the prohibition of [[Asian immigration to the United States|Asian immigration]].<ref name="nwsource"/>  
[[File:Polish berry pickers color.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Polish immigrants working on the farm, 1909. The [[Social programs in the United States|welfare]] system was practically non-existent before the 1930s and the economic pressures on the poor were giving rise to child labor.]]
Immigration patterns of the 1930s were affected by the [[Great Depression]]. In the final prosperous year, 1929, there were 279,678 immigrants recorded,<ref name="mit"/> but in 1933, only 23,068 moved to the U.S.<ref name="history"/> In the early 1930s, more people emigrated from the United States than to it.<ref name="cato"/> The U.S. government sponsored a [[Mexican Repatriation]] program which was intended to encourage people to voluntarily move to Mexico, but thousands were deported against their will.<ref name="thernstrom"/> Altogether about 400,000 Mexicans were repatriated half of them US citizens.<ref name="yale"/> Most of the Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis and World War II were barred from coming to the United States.<ref name="ushmm" /> In the post-war era, the Justice Department launched [[Operation Wetback]], under which 1,075,168 Mexicans were deported in 1954.<ref name="experience" />

In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think.|[[Ted Kennedy]], chief Senate sponsor of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.<ref name="naturalization"/>}}

===Since 1965===
The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], also known as the Hart-Cellar Act, abolished the system of national-origin quotas. By equalizing immigration policies, the act resulted in new immigration from non-European nations, which changed [[Demographics of the United States|the ethnic make-up of the United States]].<ref name="globe obama" /> In 1970, 60% of immigrants were from Europe; this decreased to 15% by 2000.<ref name="google4"/> In 1990, [[George H. W. Bush]] signed the [[Immigration Act of 1990]],<ref name="google5"/> which increased legal immigration to the United States by 40%.<ref name="google6"/> In 1991, Bush signed the [[1991 Armed Forces Immigration Adjustment Act|Armed Forces Immigration Adjustment Act 1991]], allowing foreign service members who had serve 12 or more years in the US Armed Forces to qualify for permanent residency and, in some cases, citizenship.

In November 1994, California voters passed [[Proposition 187]] amending the state constitution, denying state financial aid to illegal immigrants. The federal courts voided this change, ruling that it violated the federal constitution.<ref name=ft160313>{{Cite news|first=Daniel |last=Gonzales |title=How we got here:The many attempts to reform immigration, secure the border |url=http://www.nwcn.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2016/01/22/how-we-got-here-many-attempts-reform-immigration-secure-border/78802092/ |newspaper=Florida Today |location=Melbourne, Florida |page=1A |date=March 13, 2016|accessdate=March 13, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314054643/http://www.nwcn.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2016/01/22/how-we-got-here-many-attempts-reform-immigration-secure-border/78802092/ |archivedate=March 14, 2016 |df=mdy}}</ref><!----soft copy is "funny", truncating the lead portion of the article, but is otherwise identical to hard copy, though from different sources--->

Immigrants are likely to move to and live in areas populated by people with similar backgrounds. This phenomenon has held true throughout the history of immigration to the United States.<ref name="nap11"/> Seven out of ten immigrants surveyed by [[Public Agenda]] in 2009 said they intended to make the U.S. their permanent home, and 71% said if they could do it over again they would still come to the US. In the same study, 76% of immigrants say the government has become stricter on enforcing immigration laws since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] ("9/11"), and 24% report that they personally have experienced some or a great deal of discrimination.<ref name="publicagenda"/>

Public attitudes about immigration in the U.S. were heavily influenced in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. After the attacks, 52% of Americans believed that immigration was a good thing overall for the U.S., down from 62% the year before, according to a 2009 Gallup poll.<ref name="gallup"/> A 2008 Public Agenda survey found that half of Americans said tighter controls on immigration would do "a great deal" to enhance U.S. national security.<ref name="publicagenda12"/> Harvard political scientist and historian [[Samuel P. Huntington]] argued in his 2004 book ''[[Who Are We?

The United States admitted more legal immigrants from 1991 to 2000, between ten and eleven million, than in any previous decade. In the most recent decade, the 10 million legal immigrants that settled in the U.S. represent roughly one third of the annual growth, as the U.S. population grew by 32 million (from 249 million to 281 million). By comparison, the highest previous decade was the 1900s, when 8.8 million people arrived, increasing the total U.S. population by one percent every year. Specifically, "nearly 15% of Americans were foreign-born in 1910, while in 1999, only about 10% were foreign-born."<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

By 1970, immigrants accounted for 4.7 percent of the US population and rising to 6.2 percent in 1980, with an estimated 12.5 percent in 2009.<ref name="migrationinformation14"/> {{As of|2010}}, 25% of US residents under age 18 were first- or second-generation immigrants.<ref name="nytimes"/> Eight percent of all babies born in the U.S. in 2008 belonged to illegal immigrant parents, according to a recent analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the Pew Hispanic Center.<ref name="wsj"/>

Legal immigration to the U.S. increased from 250,000 in the 1930s, to 2.5 million in the 1950s, to 4.5 million in the 1970s, and to 7.3 million in the 1980s, before resting at about 10 million in the 1990s.<ref name="findarticles"/> Since 2000, legal immigrants to the United States number approximately 1,000,000 per year, of whom about 600,000 are ''Change of Status'' who already are in the U.S. Legal immigrants to the United States now are at their highest level ever, at just over 37,000,000 legal immigrants. In reports in 2005-2006, estimates of illegal immigration ranged from 700,000 to 1,500,000 per year.<ref name="csmonitor"/><ref name="pewhispanic"/> Immigration led to a 57.4% increase in foreign born population from 1990 to 2000.<ref name="migrationinformation15"/>

While immigration has increased drastically over the last century, the foreign born share of the population is, at 13.4, only somewhat below what it was at its peak in 1910 at 14.7%. A number of factors may be attributed to the decrease in the representation of foreign born residents in the United States. Most significant has been the change in the composition of immigrants; prior to 1890, 82% of immigrants came from North and Western Europe. From 1891 to 1920, that number dropped to 25%, with a rise in immigrants from East, Central, and South Europe, summing up to 64%. Animosity towards these different and foreign immigrants rose in the United States, resulting in much legislation to limit immigration.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Contemporary immigrants settle predominantly in seven states, [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Florida]], [[Texas]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Illinois]], comprising about 44% of the U.S. population as a whole. The combined total immigrant population of these seven states was 70% of the total foreign-born population in 2000.

Immigrant segregation declined in the first half of the 20th century, but has been rising over the past few decades. This has caused questioning of the correctness of describing the United States as a [[melting pot]]. One explanation is that groups with lower socioeconomic status concentrate in more densely populated area that have access to [[public transit]] while groups with higher socioeconomic status move to [[suburban]] areas. Another is that some recent immigrant groups are more culturally and linguistically different from earlier groups and prefer to live together due to factors such as communication costs.<ref name="segregation"/> Another explanation for increased segregation is [[white flight]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Immigrants may often do types of work that natives are largely unwilling to do, contributing to greater economic prosperity for the economy as a whole: for instance, Mexican migrant workers taking up manual farm work in the United States has close to zero effect on native employment in that occupation, which means that the effect of Mexican workers on U.S. employment outside farm work was therefore most likely positive, since they raised overall economic productivity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=10492|title=IZA – Institute for the Study of Labor|website=legacy.iza.org|access-date=February 6, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207031610/http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=10492|archivedate=February 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Research indicates that immigrants are more likely to work in risky jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average characteristics, such as immigrants' lower English language ability and educational attainment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last2=Zavodny|first2=M.|year=2009|title=Do Immigrants Work in Riskier Jobs? |journal=Demography|volume=46|issue=3|pages=535–51|doi=10.1353/dem.0.0064|pmc=2831347|pmid=19771943|last1=Pia m.

According to James Smith, a senior economist at Santa Monica-based [[RAND Corporation]] and lead author of the [[United States National Research Council]]'s study ''"[[The New Americans: Economic, Demographic, and Fiscal Effects of Immigration]]"'', immigrants contribute as much as $10 billion to the [[U.S. economy]] each year.<ref name="sfgate20" /> The NRC report found that although immigrants, especially those from Latin America, caused a net loss in terms of taxes paid versus social services received, immigration can provide an overall gain to the domestic economy due to an increase in pay for higher-skilled workers, lower prices for goods and services produced by immigrant labor, and more efficiency and lower wages for some owners of capital. The report also notes that although immigrant workers compete with [[domestic worker]]s for low-skilled jobs, some immigrants specialize in activities that otherwise would not exist in an area, and thus can be beneficial for all domestic residents.<ref name="demographic" />

A 2007 literature by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found that estimating the fiscal effects of undocumented immigrants has proven difficult:  "currently available estimates have significant limitations; therefore, using them to determine an aggregate effect across all states would be difficult and prone to considerable error". The impact of undocumented immigrants differs on federal levels than state and local levels,<ref name=":182" /> with research suggesting modest fiscal costs at the state and local levels but with substantial fiscal gains at the federal level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jrlsasw39&div=42&id=&page=|title=Fear vs. Facts: Examining the Economic Impact of Undocumented Immigrants in the U.S.|website=heinonline.org|access-date=February 9, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525112458/http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals%2Fjrlsasw39&div=42&id=&page=|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2009, a study by the [[Cato Institute]], a [[free market]] [[think tank]], found that legalization of low-skilled illegal resident workers in the US would result in a net increase in US GDP of $180 billion over ten years.<ref name="washingtonindependent" /> The Cato Institute study did not examine the impact on per capita income for most Americans. Jason Riley notes that because of progressive income taxation, in which the top 1% of earners pay 37% of federal income taxes (even though they actually pay a lower tax percentage based on their income), 60% of Americans collect more in government services than they pay in, which also reflects on immigrants.<ref name="Let Them In: The Case for Open Borders" /> In any event, the typical immigrant and his children will pay a net $80,000 more in their lifetime than they collect in government services according to the NAS.<ref name="cato23" /> Legal immigration policy is set to maximize net taxation. Illegal immigrants even after an amnesty tend to be recipients of more services than they pay in taxes. In 2010, an [[econometrics]] study by a [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] [[economist]] found that immigration helped increase bilateral trade when the incoming people were connected via networks to their country of origin, particularly boosting trade of [[final goods]] as opposed to [[intermediate goods]], but that the trade benefit weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American culture.<ref name="twsA36" />

==== Discrimination ====
Irish immigration was opposed in the 1850s by the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[Know Nothing]] movement, originating in New York in 1843. It was engendered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by [[Irish Catholic]] immigrants. On [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|March 14, 1891]], a lynch mob stormed a local jail and lynched several [[Italians]] following the acquittal of several Sicilian immigrants alleged to be involved in the murder of [[New Orleans]] police chief [[David Hennessy]]. The Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921, followed by the Immigration Act of 1924. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at limiting immigration overall, and making sure that the nationalities of new arrivals matched the overall national profile.

Since 1992, an estimated 1.7 million Muslims, approximately 1 million Hindus, and approximately 1 million Buddhists have immigrated legally to the United States.<ref name=pew-2013>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/05/17/the-religious-affiliation-of-us-immigrants/ |dead-url=yes |title=The Religious Affiliation of U.S. Immigrants: Majority Christian, Rising Share of Other Faiths |website=Pew Research Center |date=May 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805044821/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/05/17/the-religious-affiliation-of-us-immigrants/ |archivedate=August 5, 2013 }}</ref>

Conversely, non-religious are underrepresented in the immigrant populations. Although "other" non-Christian religions are also slightly more common among immigrants than among U.S. adults—1.9% compared with 1.0%—those professing no religion are slightly under-represented among new immigrants. Whereas 12% of immigrants said they had no religion, the figure was 15% for adult Americans.<ref name = "Massey_2011" /> This lack of representation for non-religious could be related to stigmas around atheists and agnostics or could relate to the need for identity when entering a new country.

=====Labor unions=====
{{Main|Immigration policies of American labor unions}}
The [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), a coalition of labor unions formed in the 1880s, vigorously opposed unrestricted immigration from Europe for moral, cultural, and racial reasons. The issue unified the workers who feared that an influx of new workers would flood the labor market and lower wages.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Collomp |first = Catherine | title = Unions, civics, and National identity: organized Labor's reaction to immigration, 1881–1897 | journal = [[Labor History (journal)|Labor History]] | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 450–474 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00236568800890311 | date = October 1988 }}</ref> Nativism was not a factor because upwards of half the union members were themselves immigrants or the sons of immigrants from Ireland, Germany and Britain. However, nativism was a factor when the AFL even more strenuously opposed all immigration from Asia because it represented (to its Euro-American members) an alien culture that could not be assimilated into American society. The AFL intensified its opposition after 1906 and was instrumental in passing immigration restriction bills from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921 [[Emergency Quota Act]] and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], and seeing that they were strictly enforced.<ref name="Mink">{{cite book |first=Gwendolyn |last=Mink |title=Old Labor and New Immigrants in American Political Development: Union, Party, and State, 1875–1920 |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1990 |edition= |isbn=0-8014-9680-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last = Lane |first = A.T. | title = American trade unions, mass immigration and the literacy test: 1900–1917 | journal = [[Labor History (journal)|Labor History]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–25 | doi = 10.1080/00236568408584739 | date = January 1984 }}</ref>

Mink (1986) concludes that the link between the AFL and the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] rested in part on immigration issues, noting the large corporations, which supported the Republicans, wanted more immigration to augment their labor force.<ref name="Mink" />

[[United Farm Workers]] during [[Cesar Chavez]] tenure was committed to restricting immigration. Chavez and [[Dolores Huerta]], cofounder and president of the UFW, fought the [[Bracero Program]] that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined U.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964. In 1973, the UFW was one of the first labor unions to oppose proposed employer sanctions that would have prohibited hiring illegal immigrants.

On a few occasions, concerns that illegal immigrant labor would undermine UFW strike campaigns led to a number of controversial events, which the UFW describes as anti-strikebreaking events, but which have also been interpreted as being anti-immigrant. In 1973, Chavez and members of the UFW marched through the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial]] and [[Coachella Valley]]s to the border of Mexico to protest growers' use of illegal immigrants as strikebreakers. Joining him on the march were Reverend [[Ralph Abernathy]] and U.S. Senator [[Walter Mondale]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov:8081/ammem/today/aug22.html|title=Today in History: August 22|last=|first=|date=January 19, 2011|website=Library of Congress:American Memory|access-date=}}</ref> In its early years, the UFW and Chavez went so far as to report illegal immigrants who served as strikebreaking replacement workers (as well as those who refused to unionize) to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520202198&id=HAd4W9OdLX0C&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&ots=X9eCyCQtaq&dq=UFW+report+undocumented&sig=I-BkkeqB84_UYgjh2Fs1affaln0#PPA197,M1|title=Walls and Mirrors: Mexican Americans, Mexican Immigrants and the Politics of Ethnicity|first=David Gregory|last=Gutiérrez|year=1995|pages=97–98|publisher=University of California Press|location=San Diego|isbn=9780520916869}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/publications/media_monitor/2003/03/05.html|title=Why Journalists Support Illegal Immigration|publisher=Accuracy in the Media|first1=Reed|last1=Irvine|first2=Cliff|last2=Kincaid|accessdate=June 18, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203084534/http://www.aim.org/publications/media_monitor/2003/03/05.html|archivedate=December 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewnEO2GvkFIC&pg=PA89&ots=3bsbckEtw7&dq=ufw+undocumented&sig=5j3oluULLZo4AfXwTVqrmvMhyAQ#PPA90,M1|title=Strawberry Fields: Politics, Class, and Work in California Agriculture|first=Miriam J.|last=Wells|pages=89–90|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=9780801482793}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnUgAAAAMAAJ&dq=ufw+undocumented&q=crack+down&pgis=1#search|title=Beyond the Border: Mexico & the U.S. Today|first1=Peter|last1=Baird|first2=Ed|last2=McCaughan|page=169|publisher=North American Congress on Latin America|isbn=9780916024376}}</ref><ref>Farmworker Collective Bargaining, 1979: Hearings Before the Committee on Labor Human Resources Hearings held in Salinas, Calif., April 26, 27, and Washington, D.C., May 24, 1979</ref>

A ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'' article attributed [[Barack Obama]]'s win in the [[United States Presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. Presidential election]] to a marked reduction over the preceding decades in the percentage of whites in the American electorate, attributing this demographic change to the Immigration Act of 1965.<ref name="globe obama"/> The article quoted [[Simon Rosenberg]], president and founder of the [[New Democrat Network]], as having said that the Act is "the most important piece of legislation that no one's ever heard of," and that it "set America on a very different demographic course than the previous 300 years."<ref name="globe obama" />

The key interests groups that lobby on immigration are religious, ethnic and business groups, together with some liberals and some conservative public policy organizations. Both the pro- and anti- groups affect policy.<ref name="prachimishra"/>

Studies have suggested that some [[special interest group]] lobby for less immigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups since they see effects of immigration, such as increased labor competition, as detrimental when affecting their own group but beneficial when affecting other groups.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

After the 2010 election, Gary Segura of Latino Decisions stated that Hispanic voters influenced the outcome and "may have saved the Senate for Democrats".<ref name="nclr"/> Several ethnic lobbies support immigration reforms that would allow [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] that have succeeded in entering to gain citizenship.

The book ''Ethnic Lobbies and US Foreign Policy'' (2009) states that several ethnic special interest groups are involved in pro-immigration lobbying. Ethnic lobbies also influence [[foreign policy]]. The authors write that "Increasingly, ethnic tensions surface in electoral races, with House, Senate, and gubernatorial contests serving as proxy battlegrounds for antagonistic ethnoracial groups and communities. In addition, ethnic politics affect party politics as well, as groups compete for relative political power within a party". However, the authors argue that currently ethnic interest groups, in general, do not have too much power in foreign policy and can balance other special interest groups.<ref name="publishers"/>

One of the first political analyses in the U.S. of the relationship between immigration and crime was performed in the beginning of the 20th century by the [[Dillingham Commission]], which found a relationship especially for immigrants from non-Northern European countries, resulting in the sweeping 1920s [[immigration reduction]] acts, including the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921, which favored immigration from [[Northern Europe|northern]] and [[western Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/dillingham.html|title=Open Collections Program: Immigration to the US, Dillingham Commission (1907-1910)|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125123555/http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/dillingham.html|archivedate=January 25, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Recent research is skeptical of the conclusion drawn by the Dillingham Commission. One study finds that "major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930, immigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all ages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments for violent offenses."<ref name=":28">{{Cite journal|last=Moehling|first=Carolyn|last2=Piehl|first2=Anne Morrison|date=November 1, 2009|title=Immigration, crime, and incarceration in early twentieth-century america |journal=Demography|volume=46|issue=4|pages=739–63|doi=10.1353/dem.0.0076|pmid=20084827|issn=0070-3370|pmc=2831353}}</ref>

==== Crimmigration ====
Crimmigration has emerged as a field in which critical immigration scholars conceptualize the current immigration law enforcement system. Crimmigration is broadly defined as the convergence of the criminal justice system and immigration enforcement,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Armenta|first=Amanda|date=2016|title=Radicalizing Crimmigration: Structural Racism, Colorblindness, and the Institutional Production of Immigrant Criminality|url=|journal=Sociology of Race and Ethnicity|volume=3|pages=|via=}}</ref> where immigration law enforcement has adopted the "criminal" law enforcement approach. This frames undocumented immigrants as "criminal" deviants and security risks.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|last=García Hernández|first=César Cuauhtémoc|date=2013|title=Creating Crimmigration|url=|journal=Brigham Young University Law Review 1457|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Crime and migration control have become completely intertwined, so much so that both undocumented and documented individuals suspected of being a noncitizen may be targeted.<ref name=":8" />

Using a "crimmigration" point of thought, César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández<ref name=":8" /> explains the criminalization of undocumented immigrants began in the aftermath of the [[civil rights movement]].<ref name=":8" /> [[Michelle Alexander]] explores how the U.S. criminal justice system is made of "colorblind" policies and law enforcement practices that have shaped the mass incarceration of people of color into an era of "The New Jim Crow"<ref name=":9">{{Cite book|title=The New Jim Crow: Mass incarceration in the age of colorblindnes|last=Alexander|first=Michelle|publisher=The New Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> As Alexander and García Hernández state, overt racism and racist laws became culturally scorned, and covert racism became the norm.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9" /> This new form of racism focuses on penalizing criminal activity and promoting "neutral" rhetoric.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":8" />

"Crimmigration" recognizes how laws and policies throughout different states contribute to the convergence of criminal law enforcement and immigration law. For example, states are implementing a variety of immigration related criminal offenses that are punishable by imprisonment. California, Oregon, and Wyoming criminalize the use of fraudulent immigration or citizenship documents.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last=García Hernández|first=César Cuauhtémoc|date=2017|title=Abolishing Immigration Prisons|url=|journal=Boston University Law Review|volume=97|pages=17–05|via=}}</ref> Arizona allows judges to confine witnesses in certain "criminal" cases if they are suspected of being in the U.S. without documentation.<ref name=":10" /> The most common violations of immigration law on the federal level are unauthorized entry (a federal misdemeanor) and unauthorized reentry (a federal felony). These "offenses" deemed as "crimes" under immigration law set the tone of "crimmigration" and for what García Hernández refers to as the "removal pipeline" of immigrants.<ref name=":10" />

Some scholars focus on the organization of "crimmigration" as it relates to the mass removal of certain immigrants. Jennifer Chacón finds that immigration law enforcement is being decentralized.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal|last=Chacón|first=Jennifer|date=2010|title=A Diversion of Attention? Immigration Courts and the Adjudication of Fourth and Fifth Amendment Rights|url=|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=59|pages=1563–1633|via=}}</ref> [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Patrol]] (CBP), [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) are the central law enforcement agencies in control of enforcing immigration law. However, other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, such as sheriff's offices, municipal police departments, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and the Drug and Enforcement Agency (DEA), aid in immigrant removal.<ref name=":13" /> In 1996, Congress expanded power to state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law. These agencies keep people locked up in jails or prison when they receive an "immigration detainer" from ICE,<ref name=":10" /> and therefore aid in interior enforcement.<ref name=":13" /> In addition, some agencies participate in the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program ("SCAAP"), which gives these agencies financial incentives to cooperate with ICE in identifying immigrants in their custody.<ref name=":10" />

In the United States, a significant proportion of scientists and engineers are foreign-born, as well as students in science and engineering programs. However, this is not unique to the US since foreigners make up significant amounts of scientists and engineers in other countries. As of 2011, 28% of graduate students in science, engineering, and health are foreign.<ref>{{cite web|title=Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering: Fall 2011|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf13331/pdf/nsf13331.pdf|publisher=National Science Foundation|page=22|date=2013}}</ref> The number of science and engineering (S&E) bachelor's degrees has risen steadily over the past 15 years, reaching a new peak of about half a million in 2009. Since 2000, foreign born students in the United States have consistently earned a small share (3%-4%) of S&E degrees at the bachelor's level. Foreign students make up a much higher proportion of S&E master's degree recipients than of bachelor's or associate degree recipients. In 2009, foreign students earned 27% of S&E master's degrees and 33% in doctorate degrees. Significant numbers of foreign born students in science and engineering are not unique to America since foreign students now account for nearly 60% of graduate students in mathematics, computer sciences, and engineering globally. In Switzerland and the United Kingdom, more than 40% of doctoral students are foreign. A number of other countries, including New Zealand, Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the United States, have relatively high percentages (more than 20%) of doctoral students who are foreign. Foreign student enrollment in the United Kingdom has been increasing. In 2008, foreign students made up 47% of all graduate students studying S&E in the United Kingdom (an increase from 32% in 1998). Top destinations for international students include the United Kingdom (12%), Germany (9%), and France (9%). Together with the U.S., these countries receive more than half of all internationally mobile students worldwide. Although the United States continues to attract the largest number and fraction of foreign students worldwide, its share of foreign students has decreased in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ch. 2 Higher Education in Science and Engineering|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/pdf/c02.pdf|publisher=National Science Foundation|date=2012|access-date=December 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527011414/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/pdf/c02.pdf|archive-date=May 27, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

55% of Ph.D. students in engineering in the United States are foreign born (2004).<ref name=wulf>William A.

At the undergraduate level, US-born engineering students constitute upwards of 90-95% of the student population (most foreign born candidates for engineering graduate schools are trained in their home countries). However, the pool of BS engineering graduates with US citizenship is much larger than the number who apply to engineering graduate schools.<ref name=osep/> The proportion of foreign-born engineers among assistant professors younger than 35 years has increased from 10% in 1972 to 50%-55% in 1983-1985, illustrating a dramatic increase on US dependence on foreign-born students in the US college system. The increase in non-citizen assistant professors of engineering is the result of the fact that, in recent years, foreign-born engineers received close to 50 percent of newly awarded engineering doctorates (naturalized citizens accounted for about 4 percent) and, furthermore, they entered academe in disproportionately large numbers.<ref name=osep/> 33% of all U.S. Ph.D.s in science and engineering are now awarded to foreign born graduate students  as of 2004.<ref name=wulf/>

In 1982, foreign-born engineers constituted about 3.6%  of all engineers employed in the United States, 13.9% of which were naturalized; and foreign-born Phds in Engineering constituted 15% and 20% were naturalized.<ref name=osep/> In 1985, foreign-born Phds represented almost 33% of the engineering post-doctorate researchers in US universities.  Foreign-born Phd engineers often accept postdoctoral position because other employment is unavailable until green card is obtained.<ref name=osep/>  A system that further incentivising replacement of US-citizens in the upper echelons of academic and private sector engineering firms due to higher educational attainment relative to native-born engineer who for the most part do train beyond undergraduate level.<ref name=walker>Walker, 'Incentivizing Replacement of Native Talent in the Upper Echelons of Science and Technology', Flattening the United States. 2004.</ref>

In recent{{when?|date=January 2019}} years, the number of applicants for faculty openings at research universities have increased dramatically.  Numbers of 50 to 200 applications for a single faculty opening have become typical, yet even with such high numbers of applicants, the foreign-born component is in excess of 50%.<ref name=osep/> 60% of the top science students and 65 percent of the top math students in the United States are the children of immigrants. In addition, foreign-born high school students make up 50 percent of the 2004 U.S.Math Olympiad's top scorers, 38 percent of the U.S. Physics Team, and 25 percent of the Intel Science Talent Search finalists—the United States' most prestigious awards for young scientists and mathematicians.<ref name=anderson>Anderson, 'The Multiplier Effect', International Educator. 2004.</ref>

Among 1985 foreign-born engineering doctorate holders, about 40% expected to work in the United States after graduating.  An additional 17 percent planned to stay on as post-doctorates, and most of these are likely to remain permanently in the United States.  Thus, almost 60% of foreign-born engineering doctorate holders are likely to become part of the US engineering labor force within a few years after graduating.  The other approximately 40% of foreign born engineering PhDs mostly likely find employment working for [[multinational corporations]] outside of the US.<ref name=osep/>

In the 2004 Intel Science Talent Search, more children (18) have parents who entered the country on H-1B (professional) visas than parents born in the United States (16). To place this finding in perspective, note that new [[H-1B visa]] holders each year represent less than 0.04 percent of the U.S. population.<ref name=anderson/> Foreign born faculty now account for over 50% of faculty in engineering (1994).<ref name=osep/>

===Lobbying===
Major American corporations spent $345 million [[lobbying]] for just three pro-immigration bills between 2006 and 2008.<ref>http://churchandstate.org.uk/2016/02/how-did-opening-borders-to-mass-immigration-become-a-left-wing-idea/</ref>

The two most prominent [[lobby groups|groups lobbying]] for more restrictive immigration policies for the United States are [[NumbersUSA]] and the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR); additionally, the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] [[think tank]] produces policy analysis supportive of a more restrictive stance.

==Public opinion==
The ambivalent feeling of Americans toward immigrants is shown by a positive attitude toward groups that have been visible for a century or more, and much more negative attitude toward recent arrivals. For example, a 1982 national poll by the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut showed respondents a card listing a number of groups and asked, "Thinking both of what they have contributed to this country and have gotten from this country, for each one tell me whether you think, on balance, they've been a good or a bad thing for this country," which produced the results shown in the table. "By high margins, Americans are telling pollsters it was a very good thing that Poles, Italians, and Jews immigrated to America. Once again, it's the newcomers who are viewed with suspicion. This time, it's the Mexicans, the Filipinos, and the people from the Caribbean who make Americans nervous."<ref name="immigration48"/><ref name="religion"/>

In a 2002 study, which took place soon after the September 11 attacks, 55% of Americans favored decreasing legal immigration, 27% favored keeping it at the same level, and 15% favored increasing it.<ref name="worldviews"/>

In 2006, the immigration-reduction advocacy think tank the Center for Immigration Studies released a poll that found that 68% of Americans think U.S. immigration levels are too high, and just 2% said they are too low. They also found that 70% said they are less likely to vote for candidates that favor increasing legal immigration.<ref name="immigration49"/> In 2004, 55% of Americans believed legal immigration should remain at the current level or increased and 41% said it should be decreased.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> The less contact a native-born American has with immigrants, the more likely one would have a negative view of immigrants.<ref name="autogenerated3" />

One of the most important factors regarding public opinion about immigration is the level of [[List of U.S. states by unemployment rate|unemployment]]; anti-immigrant sentiment is where unemployment is highest, and vice versa.<ref name="interdisciplinary50"/>

Surveys indicate that the U.S. public consistently makes a sharp distinction between legal and illegal immigrants, and generally views those perceived as "playing by the rules" with more sympathy than immigrants that have entered the country illegally.<ref name="publicagenda51"/>

According to a Gallup poll in July 2015, immigration is the fourth most important problem facing the United States and seven percent of Americans said it was the most important problem facing America today.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Riffkin|first1=Rebecca|title=Racism Edges Up Again as Most Important U.S. Problem|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/184193/racism-edges-again-important-problem.aspx|website=Gallup.com|publisher=Gallup Inc|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref> In March 2015, another Gallup poll provided insight into American public opinion on immigration; the poll revealed that 39% of people worried about immigration "a great deal."<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Justin|title=In U.S., Worries About Terrorism, Race Relations Up Sharply|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/182018/worries-terrorism-race-relations-sharply.aspx|website=Gallup.com|publisher=Gallup Inc|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref> A January poll showed that only 33% of Americans were satisfied with the current state of immigration in America.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saad|first1=Lydia|title=U.S. Mood on Economy Up, Race Relations Sharply Down|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/181187/mood-economy-race-relations-sharply-down.aspx|website=Gallup.com|publisher=Gallup Inc|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref> As an issue that is very important to Americans, polling reveals change in sentiment over time and diverse opinions regarding how to handle immigration.

Before 2012, majority of Americans supported securing United States borders compared to dealing with illegal immigrants in the United States. In 2013, that trend has reversed and 55% of people polled by Gallup revealed that they would choose "developing a plan to deal with immigrants who are currently in the U.S. illegally." Changes regarding border control are consistent across party lines, with Republicans saying that "securing U.S. borders to halt flow of illegal immigrants" is extremely important decreasing from 68% in 2011 to 56% in 2014. Meanwhile, Democrats who chose extremely important shifted from 42% in 2011 to 31% in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jeffrey M.|title=In U.S., Border Security, Immigrant Status Equally Important|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/167432/border-security-immigrant-status-equally-important.aspx|website=Gallup.com|publisher=Gallup Inc.|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref> In July 2013, 87% of Americans said they would vote in support of a law that would "allow immigrants already in the country to become U.S. citizens if they meet certain requirements including paying taxes, having a criminal background check and learning English." However, in the same survey, 83% also said they would support the tightening of U.S. border security.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Newport|first1=Frank|last2=Wilke|first2=Joy|title=Immigration Reform Proposals Garner Broad Support in U.S.|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/163169/immigration-reform-proposals-garner-broad-support.aspx|website=Gallup.com|publisher=Gallup Inc|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>

Donald Trump's campaign for Presidency focused on a rhetoric of reducing illegal immigration and toughening border security. In July 2015, 48% of Americans thought that Donald Trump would do a poor job of handling immigration problems. In November 2016, 55% of Trump's voters thought that he would do the right thing in regards to illegal immigration. In general, Trump supporters are not united upon how to handle immigration. In December 2016, Trump voters were polled and 60% said that "undocumented immigrants in the U.S. who meet certain requirements should be allowed to stay legally."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gramlich|first1=John|title=Trump voters want to build the wall, but are more divided on other immigration questions|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/29/trump-voters-want-to-build-the-wall-but-are-more-divided-on-other-immigration-questions/|website=PewResearch.org|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=November 17, 2017|date=November 29, 2016}}</ref>

American opinion regarding how immigrants affect the country and how the government should respond to illegal immigration have changed over time. In 2006, out of all U.S. adults surveyed, 28% declared that they believed the growing number of immigrants helped American workers and 55% believed that it hurt American workers. In 2016, those views had changed, with 42% believing that they helped and 45% believing that they hurt.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rainie|first1=Lee|last2=Brown|first2=Anna|title=Americans less concerned than a decade ago over immigrants' impact on workforce|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/07/americans-less-concerned-than-a-decade-ago-over-immigrants-impact-on-workforce/|website=PewResearch.org|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=November 17, 2017|date=October 7, 2016}}</ref> The PRRI 2015 American Values Atlas showed that between 46% and 53% of Americans believed that "the growing number of newcomers from other countries&nbsp;... strengthens American society."

In February 2017, the American Enterprise Institute released a report on recent surveys about immigration issues. In July 2016, 63% of Americans favored the temporary bans of immigrants from areas with high levels of terrorism and 53% said the U.S. should allow fewer refugees to enter the country. In November 2016, 55% of Americans were opposed to building a border wall with Mexico. Since 1994, Pew Research center has tracked a change from 63% of Americans saying that immigrants are a burden on the country to 27%.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bowman|first1=Karlyn|last2=O'Neil|first2=Eleanor|last3=Sims|first3=Heather|title=Welcome to America?

===Religious responses===
Religious figures in the United States have put forth their views on the topic of immigration as informed by their religious traditions.

* '''Catholicism''' &ndash; In 2018, Catholic leaders stated that asylum-limiting laws proposed by the Trump administration were immoral. Some bishops considered imposing sanctions (known as "canonical penalties") on church members who have participated in enforcing such policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/06/13/catholic-bishops-call-trumps-new-asylum-rules-immoral-with-one-suggesting-canonical-penalties-for-those-involved/|title=Catholic bishops call Trump's asylum rules 'immoral,' with one suggesting 'canonical penalties' for those involved|first=Michelle|last=Boorstein|date=June 13, 2018|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>
* '''Judaism''' &ndash; American Jewish rabbis from various denominations have stated that their understanding of Judaism is that immigrants and refugees should be welcomed, and even assisted. The exception would be if there is significant economic hardship or security issues faced by the host country or community, in which case immigration may be limited, discouraged or even prohibited altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/jewish-ethicist/immigration/|title=Immigration - OU Torah|publisher=}}</ref> Some liberal denominations place greater emphasis on the welcoming of immigrants while Conservative, Orthodox and Independent rabbis also weigh economic and security concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.momentmag.com/ask-the-rabbis-what-does-judaism-say-about-immigration/|title=Ask the Rabbis - What Does Judaism Say about Immigration?|date=January 14, 2013|publisher=}}</ref> Some provide moral arguments for both the right of country to enforce immigration standards as well as for providing some sort of amnesty for illegal migrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1898474/jewish/A-Torah-Perspective-on-National-Borders-and-Illegal-Immigration.htm|title=A Torah Perspective on National Borders and Illegal Immigration|website=www.chabad.org}}</ref>

{{See also|Illegal immigration to the United States|Guest Worker Program}}
Laws concerning immigration and naturalization include:
*the [[Immigration Act of 1990]] (IMMACT), which limits the annual number of immigrants to 700,000. It emphasizes that family reunification is the main immigration criterion, in addition to employment-related immigration.
*the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996|Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act]] (AEDPA)
*the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act]] (IIRIRA)

AEDPA and IIRARA exemplify many categories of criminal activity for which immigrants, including [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] holders, can be deported and have imposed [[mandatory detention]] for certain types of cases.

In June 2012, President Obama issued a memorandum instructing officers of the federal government to defer deporting young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children as part of the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) program.  Under the program, eligible recipients who applied and were granted DACA status were granted a two-year deferral from deportation and temporary eligibility to work legally in the country.<ref name="Hipsman2016">Faye Hipsman, Bárbara Gómez-Aguiñaga, & Randy Capps, [http://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/DACAatFour-FINAL.pdf Policy Brief: DACA at Four: Participation in the Deferred Action Program and Impacts on Recipients] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525112538/http://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/DACAatFour-FINAL.pdf |date=May 25, 2017 }}, Migration Policy Institute (August 2016).</ref> Among other criteria, in order to be eligible a youth applicant must (1) be between age 15 and 31; (2) have come to the United States before the age of 16; (3) have lived in the U.S. continuously for at least five years; (4) be a current student, or have earned a high school diploma or [[General Educational Development|equivalent]], or have received an [[honorable discharge]] from the U.S. armed services; and (5) must not "have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to public safety or national security."<ref>Jeanne Batalova, Sarah Hooker & Randy Capps, [http://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/DACA-Report-2014-FINALWEB.pdf DACA at the Two-Year Mark: A National and State Profile of Youth Eligible and Applying for Deferred Action] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525112549/http://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/DACA-Report-2014-FINALWEB.pdf |date=May 25, 2017 }}, Migration Policy Institute (August 2014), p. 3.</ref> The Migration Policy Institution estimated that as of 2016, about 1.3 million unauthorized young adults ages 15 and older were "immediately eligible for DACA"; of this eligible population, 63% had applied as of March 2016.<ref name="Hipsman2016"/>

===Military immigration===
On November 15, 2013, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that they would be issuing a new policy memorandum called "parole in place.<ref>{{cite web| title=Policy Memorandum| url=http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2013/2013-1115_Parole_in_Place_Memo_.pdf| date=November 15, 2013| accessdate=June 2, 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219060835/http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2013/2013-1115_Parole_in_Place_Memo_.pdf| archivedate=February 19, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref>" Parole in place would offer green cards to immigrant parents, spouses and children of active military duty personnel. Prior to this law relatives of military personnel – excluding husbands and wives – were forced to leave the United States and apply for green cards in their home countries. The law allows for family members to avoid the possible ten-year bar from the United States and remain in the United States while applying for lawful permanent residence.<ref name="YorkParoleInPlace">{{cite web |last=York |first=Harlan |title="Parole in Place" for Immigrant Relatives of Military-What To Know |url=https://immigrationlawnj.com/new-rule-legalize-immigrant-relatives-military/ |date=November 15, 2013 |accessdate=June 4, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614105236/https://immigrationlawnj.com/new-rule-legalize-immigrant-relatives-military/ |archivedate=June 14, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The parole status, given in one year terms, will be subject to the family member being "absent a criminal conviction or other serious adverse factors."<ref name="YorkParoleInPlace" />

Military children born in foreign countries are considered American from birth assuming both parents were American citizens at the time of birth. Children born to American citizens will have to process Conciliary Reports of Birth Abroad. This report of birth abroad is the equivalent of a birth certificate and the child will use the report in place of a Birth Certificate for documentation. However, children born in foreign countries to United States servicemembers before they have gained citizenship could only gain citizenship through the naturalization process.

===Treatment as civil proceedings===

Most immigration proceedings are [[Civil law (common law)|civil matters]], including deportation proceedings, asylum cases, employment without authorization, and visa overstay. People who evade border enforcement (such as by crossing outside any official border checkpoint), who commit fraud to gain entry, or who commit [[identity theft]] to gain employment, may face criminal charges. People entering illegally were seldom charged with this crime until [[Operation Streamline]] in 2005. Conviction of this crime generally leads to a prison term, after which the person is deported if they are not eligible to remain in the country.

The guarantees under the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], such as the [[right to counsel]], and the right to a [[jury trial]], have not been held to apply to civil immigration proceedings.  As a result, people generally represent themselves in asylum and deportation cases unless they can afford an [[immigration lawyer]] or receive assistance from a legal charity. In contrast, the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] ''has'' been applied to immigration proceedings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aliens' Right to Counsel in Removal Proceedings: In Brief |url=http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/library/P11612.pdf |publisher=Congressional Research Service |author=Kate M. Manuel |date=March 17, 2016}}</ref>  Because the [[right to confrontation]] in the Sixth Amendment does not apply, people can be ordered deported ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' - without being present at the immigration proceeding.<ref name="cnnGrievance">[https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/08/politics/immigration-judges-justice-department-grievance/index.html Immigration judge removed from cases after perceived criticism of Sessions]</ref>

[[Removal proceedings]] are considered [[administrative proceeding]]s under the authority of the [[United States Attorney General]], acting through the [[Executive Office for Immigration Review]], part of the [[United States Justice Department|Justice Department]]. Immigration judges are employees of the Justice Department, and thus part of the [[executive branch]] rather than the [[judicial branch]] of government.  Appeals are heard within the EOIR by the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]], and the Attorney General may intervene in individual cases, within the bounds of due process.<ref name="cnnGrievance" />

After various actions by Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] pressuring judges to speed up deportations, the National Association of Immigration Judges and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' editorial board called for moving immigration courts to the judicial branch, to prevent abuse by strengthening [[separation of powers]].<ref>[https://psmag.com/social-justice/immigration-court-judges-doubt-sessions-backlog-busting-plan Immigration Court Judges Are Skeptical of Jeff Sessions' Backlog-Busting Plan]</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2018/09/21/fire-jeff-sessions-boss-immigration-judges/KvUfiAtPSn5twNbju55i8L/story.html |title=Fire Jeff Sessions ... as the boss of immigration judges |author=Boston Globe editorial board |date=September 21, 2018}}</ref>

===Detention policy===
{{main|Immigration detention in the United States}}
Whether people who are awaiting a decision on their deportation are detained or released to live in the United States in the meantime (possibly paying [[bail]]) is a matter of both law and discretion of the Justice Department. The policy has varied over time and differs for those with crimes (including entry outside an official checkpoint) versus civil infractions.

The 2001 Supreme Court case ''[[Zadvydas v. Davis]]'' held that immigrants who cannot be deported because no country will accept them cannot be detained indefinitely.

==Immigration in popular culture==
[[File:Immigrants1888.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A cartoon in [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'']] from 1888 attacked businessmen for welcoming large numbers of low paid immigrants, leaving the American men unemployed.<ref name="amerikastudien"/>]]
The history of immigration to the United States is the history of the country itself, and the journey from beyond the sea is an element found in [[American folklore]], appearing over and over again in everything from ''[[The Godfather]]'' to ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' to "[[Song of Myself|The Song of Myself]]" to [[Neil Diamond]]'s "America" to the animated feature ''[[An American Tail]]''.<ref name="introduction"/>

From the 1880s to the 1910s, vaudeville dominated the popular image of immigrants, with very popular caricature portrayals of ethnic groups. The specific features of these caricatures became widely accepted as accurate portrayals.<ref name="amerikastudien54"/>

In ''The Melting Pot'' (1908), playwright [[Israel Zangwill]] (1864–1926) explored issues that dominated [[Progressive Era]] debates about immigration policies. Zangwill's theme of the positive benefits of the American [[melting pot]] resonated widely in popular culture and literary and academic circles in the 20th century; his cultural symbolism – in which he situated immigration issues – likewise informed American cultural imagining of immigrants for decades, as exemplified by Hollywood films.<ref name="interdisciplinary55"/><ref name="immigrants"/>
The popular culture's image of ethnic celebrities often includes stereotypes about immigrant groups. For example, Frank Sinatra's public image as a superstar contained important elements of the ''[[American Dream]]'' while simultaneously incorporating stereotypes about Italian Americans that were based in nativist and Progressive responses to immigration.<ref name="frontani"/>

The process of assimilation has been a common theme of popular culture. For example, "lace-curtain Irish" refers to middle-class [[Irish Americans]] desiring assimilation into mainstream society in counterpoint to the older, more raffish "shanty Irish". The occasional malapropisms and left-footed social blunders of these upward mobiles were gleefully lampooned in vaudeville, popular song, and the comic strips of the day such as ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'', starring Maggie and Jiggs, which ran in daily newspapers for 87 years (1913 to 2000).<ref name="williams"/><ref name="assimilation56"/> In ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006), Staff Sergeant Dignam regularly points out the dichotomy between the lace curtain Irish lifestyle Billy Costigan enjoyed with his mother, and the shanty Irish lifestyle of Costigan's father. In recent years the popular culture has paid special attention to Mexican immigration<ref name="immigration57"/> and the film ''[[Spanglish (film)|Spanglish]]'' (2004) tells of a friendship of a Mexican housemaid ([[Paz Vega]]) and her boss played by [[Adam Sandler]].

===Immigration in literature===
[[File:Jiggsslum1740.jpg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|Maggie and Jiggs from ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'' (January 7, 1940).]]
Novelists and writers have captured much of the color and challenge in their immigrant lives through their writings.<ref>Thomas J. Ferraro, ''Ethnic Passages: Literary Immigrants in Twentieth-Century America'' (1993)</ref>

Regarding Irish women in the 19th century, there were numerous novels and short stories by Harvey O'Higgins, Peter McCorry, Bernard O'Reilly and [[Sarah Orne Jewett]] that emphasize emancipation from Old World controls, new opportunities and expansiveness of the immigrant experience.<ref>Eva Roa White, "Emigration as Emancipation: Portrayals of the Immigrant Irish Girl in Nineteenth-Century Fiction," ''New Hibernia Review,'' Spring 2005, Vol. 9 Issue 1, pp. 95–108</ref>

On the other hand, Hladnik studies three popular novels of the late 19th century that warned Slovenes not to immigrate to the dangerous new world of the United States.<ref>Miran Hladnik, "Slovene Popular Novels about Emigration in the Nineteenth Century," ''Slovene Studies,'' 1985, Vol. 7 Issue 1/2, pp. 57–62</ref>

Jewish American writer [[Anzia Yezierska]] wrote her novel ''Bread Givers'' (1925) to explore such themes as Russian-Jewish immigration in the early 20th century, the tension between Old and New World Yiddish culture, and women's experience of immigration. A well established author Yezierska focused on the Jewish struggle to escape the ghetto and enter middle- and upper-class America. In the novel, the heroine, Sara Smolinsky, escape from New York City's "down-town ghetto" by breaking tradition. She quits her job at the family store and soon becomes engaged to a rich real-estate magnate. She graduates college and takes a high-prestige job teaching public school. Finally Sara restores her broken links to family and religion.<ref>Thomas J. Ferraro, "'Working ourselves up' in America: Anzia Yezierska's ''Bread Givers''", ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' Summer 19 90, Vol. 89 Issue 3, pp. 547–91. reprinted in  Ferraro, ''Ethnic Passages,'' pp. 53–86</ref>
 
The Swedish author [[Vilhelm Moberg]] in the mid-20th century wrote a series of four novels describing one Swedish family's migration from Småland to Minnesota in the late 19th century, a destiny shared by almost one million people. The author emphasizes the authenticity of the experiences as depicted (although he did change names).<ref>Helmer Lång, and Michael Brook, "Moberg, the Emigrant Saga and Reality," ''Swedish Pioneer Historical Quarterly,'' 1972, Vol. 23 Issue 1, pp. 3–24</ref> These novels have been translated into English (''[[The Emigrants (Swedish novel)|The Emigrants]]'', 1951, ''[[Unto a Good Land]]'', 1954, ''[[The Settlers (novel)|The Settlers]]'', 1961, ''[[The Last Letter Home]]'', 1961). The musical [[Kristina från Duvemåla]] by ex-[[ABBA]] members Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson is based on this story.<ref name="introduction58"/><ref name="historical"/>

''[[The Immigrant (musical)|The Immigrant]]'' is a musical by [[Steven Alper]], [[Sarah Knapp]], and [[Mark Harelik]]. The show is based on the story of Harelik's grandparents, Matleh and Haskell Harelik, who traveled to [[Galveston, Texas]] in 1909.<ref name="colonytheatre"/>

==Documentary films==
[[File:Immigrant to America.ogv|thumbtime=3:24|thumb|Film about historical immigration to America from ca. 1970]] 
In their documentary ''[[How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories]]'', filmmakers [[Shari Robertson]] and [[Michael Camerini]] examine the American political system through the lens of [[immigration reform]] from 2001 to 2007. Since the debut of the first five films, the series has become an important resource for advocates, policy-makers and educators.<ref name="typepad"/>

That film series premiered nearly a decade after the filmmakers' landmark documentary film ''[[Well-Founded Fear]]'' which provided a behind-the-scenes look at the [[Asylum in the United States|process for seeking asylum in the United States]]. That film still marks the only time that a film-crew was privy to the private proceedings at the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS), where individual asylum officers ponder the often life-or-death fate of immigrants seeking asylum.

==Overall approach to regulation==
University of North Carolina law professor Hiroshi Motomura has identified three approaches the United States has taken to the legal status of immigrants in his book ''Americans in Waiting: The Lost Story of Immigration and Citizenship in the United States''. The first, dominant in the 19th century, treated immigrants as in transition; in other words, as prospective citizens. As soon as people declared their intention to become citizens, they received multiple low-cost benefits, including the eligibility for free homesteads in the [[Homestead Act]] of 1869, and in many states, the right to vote. The goal was to make the country more attractive, so large numbers of farmers and skilled craftsmen would settle new lands. By the 1880s, a second approach took over, treating newcomers as "immigrants by contract". An implicit deal existed where immigrants who were literate and could earn their own living were permitted in restricted numbers. Once in the United States, they would have limited legal rights, but were not allowed to vote until they became citizens, and would not be eligible for the New Deal government benefits available in the 1930s. The third and more recent policy{{When|date=July 2010}} is "immigration by affiliation", which Motomura argues is the treatment which depends on how deeply rooted people have become in the country. An immigrant who applies for citizenship as soon as permitted, has a long history of working in the United States, and has significant family ties, is more deeply affiliated and can expect better treatment.<ref name="immigration59"/>

[[File:Statue-de-la-liberte-new-york.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|The [[Statue of Liberty]] was a common sight to many immigrants who entered the United States through [[Ellis Island]]]]
The [[American Dream]] is the belief that through hard work and determination, any United States immigrant can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice.<ref name="economics"/> According to historians, the rapid economic and industrial expansion of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a resource rich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief that anybody could get a share of the country's wealth if he or she was willing to work hard.<ref name="pennsylvania"/> This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States.<ref name="american"/>
