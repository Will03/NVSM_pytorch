== 19th International Congress of Linguists ==
The [[Swiss Linguistics Society]] (SSG) proposed that the 19th congress would be organized in [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]’s city [[Geneva]], one century after his death to commemorate on his important contributions to the field of [[linguistics]]. The events took place from July 21 to July 27, 2013.<ref>[http://me-kono.eu/conferences/international-congress-of-linguists-icl-2013 ICL 2013 conference - Me Kono]</ref>

The 19th ICL was about the ''language-cognition interface'',<ref>[http://www.cil19.org/en/presentation/ 19th ICL presentation]</ref> a topic of [[cognitive linguistics]] based on the foundational work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist who is widely considered one of the fathers of 20th-century linguistics. During the Congress, several sessions will be held about major aspects of [[linguistics]], including the [[origin of language]], [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], [[pragmatics]], [[psycholinguistics]], and [[sociolinguistics]].<ref>[http://www.cil19.org/en/sessions/ 19th ICL sessions]</ref>
