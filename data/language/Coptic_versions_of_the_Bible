There have been many '''Coptic versions of the Bible''', including some of the earliest translations into any language. Several different versions were made in the ancient world, with different editions of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]] in all four of the major dialects of [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: [[Bohairic]] (northern), [[Fayyumic]], [[Sahidic]] (southern), [[Akhmimic]], and Mesokemic. Biblical books were translated from the Alexandrian Greek version.

The Sahidic was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period, after the 11th century Bohairic became dominant and only used dialect of the Coptic language.

Partial copies of a number of Coptic Bibles survive. A considerable number of [[apocryphal]] texts also survive in Coptic, most notably the [[Gnostic]] [[Nag Hammadi library]]. Coptic remains the liturgical language of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] and Coptic editions of the Bible are central to that faith.

Translators of books of the Old Testament into Egyptian dialects were naturally made from the Alexandrian Greek version ([[Septuagint]]), and there is no reason to doubt that they were translated at as early a date as the Gospels and Epistles, if not indeed before them. Portions of the Old Testament exist in each Egyptian dialect.<ref>{{Cite book

In Sahidic, some Biblical books survived with complete text, as well as a large number of extant fragments representing most of the canonical books and certain of the deutero-canonical (the two Wisdoms, the Epistle of Jeremiah, and the Greek additions to Daniel).

== New Testament ==
[[File:Coptic luke.jpg|right|thumb|200px|8th century Coptic manuscript of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 5:5—9]]
[[File:Coptictesttext.png|thumb|right|200px|John 1:1-4]]
The two main dialects, Sahidic and Bohairic, are the most important for the study of early versions of the New Testament. The Sahidic was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century 
, but most texts come from the 9th century and later.

=== Sahidic ===

The collection of manuscripts of Sahidic translations is often designated by cop<sup>sa</sup> in academic writing and [[critical apparatus]] ("Sa" for "versio Sahidica" in BHS). The first translation into the Sahidic dialect was made at the end of the 2nd century in Upper Egypt, where Greek was less well understood. So the Sahidic is famous for being the first major literary development of the Coptic language, though literary work in the other dialects soon followed. By the ninth century, Sahidic was gradually replaced by neighbouring Bohairic, and disappeared. Knowledge of the Sahidic manuscripts was lost until they were rediscovered in the 18th century. In 1778 [[Carl Gottfried Woide|Woide]] issued a prospectus in which he announced his intention of publishing from Oxford manuscripts the fragments of the New Testament "iuxta interpretationem dialecti Superioris Aegypti, quae Thebaidica seu Sahidica appellantur".<ref>{{Cite book

=== Bohairic ===
[[File:Uncial 0177 r Lk 1,59-73.jpg|thumbnail|[[Uncial 0177]] with the text of Luke 1:59-73]]
The Bohairic (dialect of Lower Egypt) translation was made a little later, as the Greek language was more influential in lower (northern) Egypt. Probably, it was made in the beginning of the 3rd century. It was a very literal translation; many Greek words, and even some grammatical forms (e.g. syntactic construction μεν — δε) were incorporated to this translation. For this reason, the Bohairic translation is more helpful in the reconstruction of the early Greek text than any other ancient translation. It should also be noted that the Bohairic translation was influenced by several variables, including the other dialects, primarily Sahidic and Fayyumic. When the patriarchate moved from [[Alexandria]] to [[Cairo]] in the 11th century, Bohairic was the dominant language of the Coptic church. As the official dialect of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]], Bohairic seems to enjoy a strong relationship with mainly the other dialects, [[Egyptian Arabic]] and—as it was for several centuries—Greek. The text is mainly Alexandrian, somewhat influenced by the [[Western text-type]]. The Bohairic translation is designated by cop<sup>bo</sup>.

The order of books: Gospels (John, Matthew, Mark, Luke), Pauline epistles (Hebrews between 2 Thess and 1 Tim), Catholic epistles, Acts, and Apocalypse.<ref name = Nestle134>Eberhard Nestle, ''Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the Greek New Testament'', Oxford 1901, p. 134.</ref> The Apocalypse is preserved in relatively few manuscripts.<ref>[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''The Early Versions of the New Testament'', Oxford University Press, 1977, p. 123.</ref>

Omitted verses: Matthew 17:21 (some mss); 18:11 (mss); 23:14 (mss); Mark 9:44.46; 11:26 (mss); 15:28 (mss); Luke 17:36; 22:43-44; John 5:4 (mss); 7:53-8:11 (mss); Acts 8:37; 15:34 (mss); 24:7; 28:29; Romans 16:24.

It contains Matthew 12:47; Some manuscripts of the Bohairic version contains verses: 17: 21; 18:11; 23:14; Mark 11:26; 15:28; John 5:4; 7:53-8:11; Acts 15:34;

In Acts 27:37 it reads "one hundred seventy six" for "two hundred seventy six".<ref name = UBS524/>

; Some manuscripts
The original {Old} Bohairic version is well represented by manuscripts. More than a hundred of manuscripts have survived. All have the last twelve verses of Mark.

* The earliest surviving manuscript of the four Gospels is dated A.D. 889. It is not complete.
* ''[[Papyrus Bodmer III]]'' is the oldest manuscript of the Bohairic version.<ref>R. Kasser, ''Papyrus Bodmer III. Evangile de Jean et Genese I-IV, 2 en bohairique'', (CSCO clxxvii, Scriptores coptici, XXV; Louvain, 1958).</ref> It was discovered by John M. Bodmer of Geneva in Upper Egypt. It contains the Gospel of John, dated palaeographically to the 4th century. It contains 239 pages, but the first 22 are damaged.
* [[Huntington MS 17]], bilingual Bohairic-Arabic, dated to 1174, the oldest manuscript with complete text of the four Gospels in Bohairic.
* [[Huntington MS 20]], bilingual Bohairic-Greek, with complete text of the four Gospels.
* [[Oriental MS 424]], bilingual Bohairic-Arabic, dated to 1308, with complete text of the Pauline epistles, Catholic epistles, and the Acts.
* [[Codex Marshall Or. 5]].

The Bohairic version was employed by [[John Mill (theologian)|Mill]] for his edition of 1707. It was first published in 1716 by Wilkins, who edited "Novum Testamentum Aegyptium vulgo Copticum". His edition was accompanied with a Latin translation.<ref>[[Eberhard Nestle]], ''Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the Greek New Testament'', Oxford 1901, pp. 133-134.</ref> Horner produced a critical edition of the Bohairic New Testament in 1898-1905.<ref>[[George William Horner|George Horner]], ''The Coptic Version of the New Testament in the Northern Dialect, otherwise called Memphitic and Bohairic'', 4 vols. (1898-1905; repr. Osnabrück: 1969).</ref> Horner used more than fifty Bohairic manuscripts preserved in that time in the libraries of Europe.<ref name = Nestle134/>
