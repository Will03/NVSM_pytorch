'''Alfred Dillwyn "Dilly" Knox''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (23 July 1884 &ndash; 27 February 1943) was a British [[classics]] scholar and [[papyrologist]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]] and a [[cryptanalysis|codebreaker]]. As a member of the [[World War I]] [[Room 40]] codebreaking unit, he helped decrypt the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] which brought the USA into [[World War I]].<ref name="Gannon 2011">{{Harvnb |Gannon|2011}}</ref> He joined the [[Government Code and Cypher School|GC&CS]] at the war's end.<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma">{{Harvnb|Batey|2011}}</ref> 

As Chief Cryptographer,<ref name ="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/> Knox played an important role in the Polish-French-British meetings on the eve of [[World War II]] which disclosed [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Polish disclosures|Polish cryptanalysis]] of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] Enigma to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/> 

At [[Bletchley Park]] he worked on the cryptanalysis of [[Enigma machine|Enigma ciphers]] until his death in 1943. He built the team and discovered the method that broke the Italian Naval [[Enigma machine|Enigma]], producing the intelligence credited with [[Allies (World War II)|Allied]] victory at the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]]. In 1941, Knox broke the [[Abwehr]] [[Enigma machine|Enigma]].<ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'>{{Harvnb |Batey|2009|p=xi}}</ref> By the end of the war, '''Intelligence Service Knox''' had disseminated 140,800 [[Abwehr]] decrypts,<ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'/> including intelligence important for [[D-Day]].<ref name='telegraph.obituary' />

==Personal life and family==
Dillwyn Knox, the fourth of six children,<ref name="odnb">{{Harvnb |Batey |2004 }}</ref> was the son of [[Edmund Arbuthnott Knox]],<!-- notable:  he has an ODNB entry--> tutor at [[Merton College]] and later [[Bishop of Manchester]]; he was the brother of [[E. V. Knox]], [[Wilfred Knox]] and [[Ronald Knox]],<!-- also all with ODNB entries--><ref name="odnb"/> and uncle of the novelist [[Penelope Fitzgerald]].<ref name='fitzgerald.knox'>{{Harvnb |Fitzgerald|2002|}}</ref> His father was a descendant of [[John Arbuthnott, 8th Viscount of Arbuthnott]].<ref>Dod's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland, Sampson Low, Marston & Co., 1904, p. 983</ref><ref>The Spectator, vol. 20, 1847, p. 1171</ref><ref>The Gentleman's Magazine, vol. 177, 1845, p. 311</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kittybrewster.com/members/e_2.htm|title=Table E part 2|first=Sir William Arbuthnot|last=Bt|website=www.kittybrewster.com}}</ref>

Dillwyn—known as "Dilly"—Knox was educated at [[Summer Fields School]], Oxford, and then [[Eton College]].<ref name="odnb"/> He studied classics at [[King's College, Cambridge]] from 1903,<ref name=Classics>[http://www.classicsireland.com/2002/richmond.html Richmond, John ''Classics and Intelligence'' - 'Classics Ireland' Volume 9 (2002)]</ref> and in 1909 was elected a Fellow<ref name="odnb"/> following the death of [[Walter George Headlam]], from whom he inherited extensive research into the works of [[Herodas]]. While an [[undergraduate]] he was friends with [[Lytton Strachey]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]]. He and Keynes were lovers at Eton.<ref name=Supermac>{{Cite book |title= Supermac: The Life of Harold Macmillan |last= Thorpe|first= D.R.|page= 27 |publisher=[[Chatto & Windus]] |year= 2010}}</ref> Knox privately coached [[Harold Macmillan]], the future [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] at King's for a few weeks in 1910, but Macmillan found him "austere and uncongenial".<ref name=Classics/>

He married Olive Rodman in 1920, forgetting to invite two of his three brothers to his wedding.<ref name='batey.enigmas.xii'>{{Harvnb|Batey|2009|p=xii}}</ref> The couple had two sons, Oliver and Christopher.  

He was an [[atheist]].<ref>"Dillwyn [Knox, son of an Evangelical bishop] was from his student years an unwavering atheist."

LXI, no. 19 (December 4, 2014), p. 8. (The article comprises pp. 8, 10, 12.)</ref>

==Academic scholarship==
Between the two World Wars Knox worked on the great commentary on [[Herodas]] that had been started by [[Walter George Headlam|Headlam]], damaging his eyesight while studying the [[British Museum]]'s collection of [[papyrus]] fragments, but finally managing to decipher the text of the Herodas papyri. The Knox-Headlam edition of Herodas finally appeared in 1922.<ref>{{Citation | last = Herodas | author-link = Herodas | editor-last = Hedlam | editor-first = Walter | editor-link = Walter George Headlam | editor2-last = Knox | editor2-first = A.

==Codebreaking==
=== World War I ===

Soon after [[World War I]] broke out in 1914,<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/> Knox was recruited to the [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy's]] [[Cryptography|cryptological]] effort in [[Room 40]] of the Admiralty Old Building,<ref>{{Harvnb|Goebel}}</ref> where some of his best work is said to have been done in the bath (in Room 53).<ref name="codebreaker.pre-war"/> In 1917, Knox followed Room 40 with its expansion into [[ID25]].<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/>

Among other tasks, he was involved in breaking:
* the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] which brought the USA into the war.<ref name="Gannon 2011"/>
* much of the German admiral's flag code by exploiting an operator's love of romantic poetry.<ref name ="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/>

===Between WW1 and WW2===
====Government Code and Cypher School====
{{Rquote|right|Oh, if a time should ever come when we're demobilized
How we shall miss the interests which once life comprised!|Dilly the Dodo<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/>|Alice in ID25 by [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Frank Birch]]}}
During [[World War I]] he had been elected Librarian at King's College, but never took up the appointment. After the war Knox intended to resume his research at King’s, but was persuaded by his wife to remain at his secret work; indeed, so secret was this work that his own children had no idea, until many years after his death, what he did for a living, and his contribution to the war effort.<ref name=Classics/>

====Commercial Enigma====
The [[Enigma machine]] became available commercially in the 1920s. In [[Vienna]] in 1925,<ref name="codebreaker.hugh_foss">{{Harvnb|Foss|2011}}</ref> Knox bought the Enigma 'C' machine evaluated by [[Hugh Foss]] in 1927 on behalf of GC&CS. Foss found "a high degree of security" but wrote a secret paper describing how to attack the machine if ''cribs'' — short sections of plain text — could be guessed.<ref name="copeland.colossus.smith">{{Harvnb|Smith|2010}}</ref> When — a decade later — Knox picked up this work, he developed a more effective algebraic system (''rodding'') based on the principles described by Foss.<ref name="codebreaker.hugh_foss"/>

====Spanish Enigma====
Germany Navy adopted Enigma in 1926, adding a plug-board ('stecker') to improve security. [[Nazi Germany]] supplied non-steckered machines to [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]].  On 24 April 1937, Knox broke Franco's Enigma<ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/> but knowledge of this breakthrough was not shared with the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2008}} States "Professor Denis Smyth, of the University of Toronto, an expert on Second World War intelligence operations, said that the British codebreaker Alfred Dilwyn Knox cracked the code of Franco's machine in 1937, but 'this information was not passed on to the Republicans'."</ref> Soon afterwards, Knox began to attack signals between Spain and Germany encrypted using steckered Enigma machines.<ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/>

====On the eve of World War II====
=====Polish-French-British meetings=====
GC&CS began to discuss Enigma with [[France]]'s [[Deuxième Bureau]] in 1938, obtaining from the Bureau details of [[Wehrmacht Enigma]] supplied by [[Asché]] and signal intercepts, some of which must have been made in [[Eastern Europe]]. This led the French to disclose their links with [[Biuro Szyfrów|Polish cryptographers]].<ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/>  Knox, [[Hugh Foss]] and [[Alastair Denniston]] represented [[Government Code and Cypher School|GS&CS]] at the first Polish-French-British meeting at Paris in January 1939.<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/> The Poles were under order to disclose nothing of importance at this time, leaving the British codebreakers disappointed. However Knox's description of his system of rodding impressed the Polish codebreakers, and they requested his presence at a second meeting.<ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/>
{{Quotation| Knox grasped everything very quickly, almost quick as lightning. It was evident that the British had been really working on Enigma ... So they didn't require explanations. They were specialists of a different kind, of a different class.|[[Marian Rejewski]]<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/>}}

Knox attended the second [[Biuro Szyfrów#Gift to allies|Polish-French-British conference]], held on 25–26 July 1939 at the Polish [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] facility (at [[Pyry (neighborhood)|Pyry]], south of [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]). Here, the Poles began to disclose to their French and British allies their achievements in solving [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] [[decryption]].<ref name="Budiansky">{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=95,96}}</ref>

Although [[Marian Rejewski]], the Polish [[cryptographer]] and [[mathematician]] who solved the plugboard-equipped [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] used by [[Nazi Germany]], approached the problem through [[Group theory|permutation theory]] (whereas Knox applied [[linguistics]]) a good personal relationship was quickly established at the conference. The good impression made by Rejewski on Knox played an important role in increasing recruitment of mathematicians to [[Bletchley Park]].<ref name ="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/> Knox was chagrined — but grateful — to learn how simple was the solution of the Enigma's entry ring (standard [[alphabetical order]]).<ref name="Budiansky"/> {{Quotation| It was such an obvious thing to do, really a silly thing to do, that nobody, not Dilly Knox or Tony Kendrick or Alan Turing, ever thought it worthwhile trying it.|[[Peter Twinn]]<ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/>}}

After the meeting, he sent the Polish cryptologists a very gracious note in Polish, on official British government stationery, thanking them for their assistance and sending "sincere thanks for your cooperation and patience".<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/> Enclosed were a beautiful scarf featuring a picture of a [[Derby (horse race)|Derby]] winner and a set of paper 'batons'.<ref name="Budiansky"/>{{Quotation|I don't know how Knox's method was supposed to work, most likely he had hoped to vanquish Enigma with the batons. Unfortunately we beat him to it.|[[Marian Rejewski]]<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/>}}

These 'batons' were known as rods to the British and had been used to solve the Spanish Enigma. Knox's rodding method was later used to break the Italian Naval Enigma.<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/>

=====Turing's bombe=====
[[Alan Turing]] worked on Enigma during the months leading to the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, and occasionally visited GC&CS's London HQ to discuss this problem with Knox. 
In the [[1939 Registration]], Turing was recorded in [[Naphill]], staying with Knox and his wife.
By November 1939, Turing had completed the design of the [[bombe]] — a radical improvement of the Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|bomba]].<ref name=codebreaker.copeland>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2011|p=313}}</ref>

===World War II===
====Knox's rodding method====
To break non-steckered [[Enigma machine]]s (those without a plugboard), Knox (building on earlier research by [[Hugh Foss]]<ref name="copeland.colossus.smith"/>) developed a system known as 'rodding', a linguistic as opposed to mathematical way of breaking codes. This technique worked on the Enigma used by the [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Carter|p=1}}</ref> and the German [[Abwehr]]. Knox worked in 'the Cottage', next door to the [[Bletchley Park]] mansion, as head of a research section, which contributed significantly to [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma]].<ref name="odnb"/>

Knox's team at ''The Cottage'' used rodding to decrypt intercepted Italian naval signals describing the sailing of an Italian battle fleet, leading to the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in March 1941. [[John Henry Godfrey|Admiral John Godfrey]], [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Director of Naval Intelligence]] credited the [[Allied (World War II)|Allied]] victory at Matapan to this intelligence; [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham]], who had commanded the victorious fleet at Matapan, went to Bletchley to personally congratulate 'Dilly and his girls'.<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/>

====Intelligence Services Knox====
In October 1941, Knox solved the [[Enigma machine|Abwehr Enigma]].<ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'/> Intelligence Services Knox (ISK) was established to decrypt [[Abwehr]] communications.<ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'/>In early 1942, with Knox seriously ill, [[Peter Twinn]] took charge of running ISK<ref name='telegraph.obituary'>{{citation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1476763/Peter-Twinn.html|title=Peter Twinn|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=17 November 2004|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> and was appointed head after Knox's death.<ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'/> By the end of the war, ISK had decrypted and disseminated 140,800 messages.<ref name='batey.enigmas.xi'/>

Intelligence gained from these Abwehr decrypts played an important part in ensuring the success of [[Double-Cross System|Double-Cross operations]] by MI5 and MI6, and in [[Operation Fortitude]], the Allied campaign to deceive the Germans about [[D-Day]].<ref name='telegraph.obituary' />

====Death====
Knox's work was cut short when he fell ill with [[lymphoma]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2000|p=350}}</ref> When he became unable to travel to Bletchley Park, he continued his cryptographic work from his home in [[Hughenden Valley|Hughenden, Buckinghamshire]], where he received the [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]].<ref name="fitz249250">{{Harvnb|Fitzgerald|2002|pp=249–250}}</ref> He died on 27 February 1943.<ref name="fitz249250"/> A biography of Knox, written by [[Mavis Batey]], one of 'Dilly's girls', the female codebreakers who worked with him, was published in September 2009.<ref>{{Harvnb|Batey|2009}}</ref>

==Classified poetry==
{{Centered pull quote| These have knelled your fall and ruin, but your ears were far away
English lassies rustling papers through the sodden Bletchley day.|author=Dilly Knox|source=Epitaph on Matapan to Mussolini<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/>}}

Knox celebrated the victory at [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] with poetry, which remained classified until 1978.<ref name="codebreaker.italian_enigma"/>

==Portrayals in fiction==
Knox is shown recruiting [[Alan Turing]] to [[Bletchley Park]] in [[Hugh Whitemore]]'s play, ''[[Breaking the Code]]'' (1986). In the 1996 television film, he is portrayed by [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]].
