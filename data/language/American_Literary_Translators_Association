The '''American Literary Translators Association''' (ALTA) bridges cultural communication and understanding among countries and languages through the art and craft of literary translation. The only organization in the United States dedicated solely to [[literary translation]], ALTA promotes literary translation through its annual conference, which draws hundreds of translators and literary professionals from around the world; the National Translation Awards in Poetry and Prose, an annual $5,000 prize (divvied $2,500 each) for the best book-length translation into English of poetry and prose; the Lucien Stryk Asian Translation Prize, which awards $5,000 each year for the best book-length translation of an Asian work into English; the Cliff Becker Book in Translation Prize, given to an unpublished book-length manuscript of poetry in translation. It includes a $1,000 prize and publication by White Pine Press; and the ALTA Travel Fellowships, which are $1,000 prizes awarded annually to 4-6 emerging translators for travel to the annual conference. Starting in 2016, in addition to the ALTA Travel Fellowships, one fellowship, the Peter K. Jansen Memorial Fellowship is awarded to an emerging translator of color or translator from a stateless or diaspora language.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://literarytranslators.org/awards/alta-travel-fellowships/jansen-fellowship|title = Jansen Fellowship|website = The American Literary Translators Association}}</ref>

==History==

The American Literary Translators Association (ALTA) was co-founded by Rainer Schulte and A. Leslie Willson in 1978 at [[The University of Texas at Dallas]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission |url=http://literarytranslators.org/about |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925213025/http://www.literarytranslators.org/about |archivedate=2017-09-25 |website=The American Literary Translators Association |access-date=2018-04-05 |df= }}</ref> ALTA's own scholarly journal, ''Translation Review'', was also founded in 1978 and has been published regularly ever since. The ALTA Annual Conference has convened every year since 1978 in various locations throughout North America. From 1978 until 2014, ALTA was administratively housed at the University of Texas at Dallas. In late 2013, in advance of the upcoming planned split with UT-Dallas, the ALTA board announced long-term plans to develop ALTA into an independent, non-profit arts organization. As of 2014, ALTA is transitioning from its long-time home at UT-Dallas toward a long-term future as a fully self-sustaining organization.

==Annual conference==

The annual ALTA conference is a four-day gathering of professional literary translators, translation students and scholars, publishers of literature in translation, and others interested in the study, practice, and promotion of literary translation. Conference events include: panel presentations on a wide range of topics related to literary translation; roundtable discussions of issues relevant to literary translators, scholars, and publishers; bilingual readings of recently published translations or translations in progress; and interactive workshops on translating specific texts. In addition, each conference features keynote presentations by invited speakers; readings by the ALTA Fellows; a book exhibit of recently published literature in translation; announcements of the National Translation Awards in Poetry and Prose, the Lucien Stryk Asian Translation Prize, the Italian Prose in Translation Award, and the Cliff Becker Book Prize in Translation; a multilingual performance of poetry recitation known as Declamación; special events such as film screenings or play stagings; and abundant opportunities for connections among translators, students, scholars, and publishers dedicated to fostering literary translation. In recent years, ALTA conference organizers have selected a conference theme to guide panel, workshop, and roundtable proposals in the direction of a broadly defined aspect of literary translation studies. Themes may address geographies, genres, literary elements, or other angles for approaching literary translation theory and practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALTA: General Conference Information |url=http://literarytranslators.org/conference |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109230343/http://literarytranslators.org/conference |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}</ref>

==Awards==

===National Translation Award===

The [[National Translation Award]] (NTA) in Poetry and Prose is awarded annually for the book-length translations of fiction, poetry, drama, or creative non-fiction that, in the estimation of the panel of judges, represents the most valuable contribution to the field of literary translation each in poetry and prose made during the previous year. The original work may have been written in any language, but in order to be eligible for the NTA, the translation must be into English, the translator must be a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident, and the book must have been published during the preceding calendar year. The prize awarded annually to the winning translator is worth $2,500 each in Poetry and Prose. In addition to honoring individual translators for their work, the NTA celebrates the craft of literary translation and strives to increase its visibility and broaden its market. The winner is announced each year at the ALTA Annual Conference.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALTA: National Translation Award |url=http://literarytranslators.org/awards/national-translation-award |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619192230/http://literarytranslators.org/awards/national-translation-award |archivedate=June 19, 2014 }}</ref>

===Lucien Stryk Asian Translation Prize===

In 2009, ALTA announced a new $5,000 translation award named in honor of [[Lucien Stryk]] (1924-2013), acclaimed Zen poet and translator of Japanese and Chinese Zen poetry. The Lucien Stryk Prize is awarded annually to the translator of a book-length translation of Asian poetry or prose, or source texts from Zen Buddhism. Eligible translations may be from Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Sanskrit, Tamil, Thai, or Vietnamese into English.

The inaugural Lucien Stryk Prize was awarded in 2010. The winner is announced each year at the ALTA Annual Conference.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALTA: Lucien Stryk Prize |url=http://literarytranslators.org/awards/lucien-stryk-prize |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213070329/http://literarytranslators.org/awards/lucien-stryk-prize |archivedate=December 13, 2013 }}</ref>

===ALTA Travel Fellowships===

ALTA Travel Fellowships are awards of $1,000 each that are designed to help early-career translators cover the travel and lodging expenses associated with attending the ALTA Annual Conference. Each year, four to six winners are selected through a competitive application process, and ALTA Fellows give a public reading of their work at the conference.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALTA: Travel Fellowships |url=http://literarytranslators.org/awards/alta-travel-fellowships |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128050725/http://literarytranslators.org/awards/alta-travel-fellowships |archivedate=November 28, 2013 }}</ref> ALTA Fellows are typically first-time ALTA conference attendees and, although they may have a few published translations, they must be relatively early in their translation careers.
