Most '''New Zealand place names''' are derived from [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] sources. Both groups used names to commemorate notable people, events, places from their homeland, and their ships, or to describe the surrounding area. It is unknown whether Māori had a name for the whole of [[New Zealand]] before the arrival of Europeans, but post-colonisation the name ''[[Aotearoa]]'' (commonly translated as 'long white cloud') has been used to refer to the whole country. Dutch cartographers named the islands ''Nova Zeelandia,'' the Latin translation of the Dutch ''Nieuw Zeeland'' (after the Dutch province of [[Zeeland]]).  British explorer [[James Cook]] subsequently [[anglicised]] the name to New Zealand.

Many of the early [[Māori language|Māori names]] were replaced by Europeans during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Government [[amend (motion)|amendments]] in 1894 and the establishment of the [[New Zealand Geographic Board]] in the mid-1940s led to the encouragement of original Māori names, although differing spellings and anglicised pronunciations persisted. Many names now have alternative or [[Dual naming|dual]] English and Māori names or, in a few rare cases, dual Māori names or dual English names. Most names have never been made official, but if they are mentioned in authoritative publications they are considered recorded names. Colloquial names in New Zealand result from an ironic view of the place's entertainment value, or plays on advertising mottos, or are shortened versions of the full name. Some places tried to capitalise on the success of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films by linking themselves to the movies.

No known pre-contact Māori name for New Zealand as a whole survives, although the Māori had several names for the [[North Island|North]] and [[South Island]]s; including ''[[Te Ika-a-Māui]]'' (the fish of [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Māui]]) for the North Island and ''[[Te Waipounamu]]'' (the waters of [[Pounamu|greenstone]]) or ''Te Waka o Aoraki'' (the canoe of Aoraki) for the [[South Island]].{{sfn|Mein Smith|2005|p=6}} Until the early 20th century, Māori also referred to the North Island as [[Aotearoa]],{{sfn|King|2003|p=41}} (commonly translated as 'long white cloud'); in modern Māori usage this has become the name for the whole country.{{sfn|Hay, Maclagan, Gordon|p=72}}

The first European visitor to New Zealand, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer [[Abel Tasman]], named the islands ''[[Staten Landt]]'', believing it formed part of the [[Isla de los Estados|land]] which [[Jacob Le Maire]] had seen off the coast of [[Tierra del Fuego]].<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Wilson|title=European discovery of New Zealand – Abel Tasman|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=March 2009|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/european-discovery-of-new-zealand/2|accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref> [[Hendrik Brouwer]] proved the supposedly South American land an island in 1643, and Dutch cartographers subsequently renamed Tasman's discovery ''Nova Zeelandia,'' from Latin, after the Dutch province of [[Zeeland]].<ref name="StatenLandt">{{cite web| url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/european-discovery-of-new-zealand/3 |title=Tasman’s achievement |publisher=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=September 2007 |accessdate=16 February 2008 |last=Wilson |first=John}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mackay|first=Duncan|year=1986|chapter=The Search For The Southern Land|editor-last=Fraser|editor-first= B|title=The New Zealand Book Of Events|location=Auckland|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Reed Methuen]]|pages=52–54}}</ref> ''Nova Zeelandia'' later became ''Nieuw Zeeland'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and British explorer [[James Cook]] subsequently called the archipelago New Zealand, an anglicised form of the Dutch name.

The 1840 [[Letters Patent]] established New Zealand as a British colony and claimed the "principal islands" of New Zealand, identified by their commonly known names at the time: the Northern Island (the North Island), the Middle Island (the South Island) and Stewart's Island or "South Island".<ref name = "Paterson"/><ref>{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Brunner|authorlink=Thomas Brunner|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/BruJour-fig-BruJour_P001a.html |title=The Great Journey: an expedition to explore the interior of the Middle Island, New Zealand, 1846-8|publisher=[[Royal Geographical Society]]|year=1851}}</ref> The letters patent attempted to rename the islands [[New Ulster]], [[New Munster Province|New Munster]] and [[New Leinster]] after the [[Provinces of Ireland|provinces in Ireland]].<ref name = "Paterson">{{cite encyclopedia|editor-first=Alexander|editor-last=McLintock|title=New Leinster, New Munster, and New Ulster|first=Donald |last=Paterson|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/1966/provinces/1|accessdate=7 January 2011|date=April 2009|origyear=originally published in 1966|encyclopedia=from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand}}</ref> New Ulster, New Munster and New Leinster were also used for the initial [[provinces of New Zealand]], but the names did not endure.

Many Māori place names possess either historical or mythological significance. Their meaning is not always apparent from literal translations, but some interpretations have passed down through oral tradition.<ref name ="Maori Names"/><ref name ="FIG">{{cite web|title= FIG 2010 Conference Paper: Place Naming Legislation in New Zealand|date= April 2010|url= https://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig2010/papers/ts07i/ts07i_grant_shaw_4557.pdf|accessdate= 25 July 2018|publisher= Land Information New Zealand}}</ref> Before the arrivals of Europeans, place names often commemorated notable or historical incidents, described features of the location or  derived from traditional ''[[Hawaiki]]'' names or myths.

Early Māori explorers such as [[Kupe]], [[Ngahue]], and [[Toi (name)|Toi]] named many of New Zealand's coastal features. Like later European explorers, they named things after themselves, their family members and events that occurred at the newly-discovered locations. [[Kahumatamomoe]] named [[Manukau Harbour]] after a [[Leptospermum scoparium |manuka]] stake that he used to claim ownership of the area, and [[Kaipara Harbour]] after the [[Ptisana salicina |para fern]] he ate there (''kai'' means food).<ref>{{cite web|first= Rāwiri|last= Taonui|title= Ngā waewae tapu – Māori exploration – Te Arawa explorers|publisher= Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date= March 2009|url= http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/nga-waewae-tapu-maori-exploration/5|accessdate= 27 February 2011}}</ref> The Māori name for [[Wellington Harbour]], ''Te Whanganui a Tara'' (the great harbour of Tara), derives from Tara, a grandson of Kupe and ancestor of several local ''[[iwi]]''.<ref>{{cite web| first= Darren| last= Reid| title= Muaūpoko – Early history| work= Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand| date= March 2009| url =http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/muaupoko/1| accessdate= 27 February 2011}}</ref> Names from other islands visited during the [[Maori migration canoes|Polynesian migrations]] have become attached to some New Zealand landmarks, for example [[Raratoka Island]] (from [[Rarotonga]]) and Tawhiti (from [[Tahiti]]). [[Whakatane]], [[Rangitoto Island]], [[Taupo]], [[Te Urewera|Urewera]], [[Ngongotaha]], and [[Lake Tikitapu|Tikitapu]] all commemorate incidents that occurred during the early arrivals, many of which are now forgotten.<ref name ="Maori Names"/>

[[Maketu]] and [[Moehau Range| Mount Moehau]] are two of the few remaining names connected to places in ''Hawaiki''. The use of [[Polynesian mythology]] in names is more apparent, with [[Tāne]] (the forest god) lending his name to [[Otane]] and [[Taneatua]], among others.

Descriptive words often occur as part of a place name: widely-used elements include:<ref>

European arrivals exposed Māori to Christianity, leading to the settlements of [[Jerusalem, New Zealand|Hiruharama]], [[Bay View, New Zealand|Petane]] and [[Hallett's Bay, New Zealand|Hamaria]] - named after the biblical [[Jerusalem]], [[Bethany]] and [[Samaria]] respectively.

===Post-colonial recognition===
Early Europeans replaced most of the original Māori names with their own, although they retained some Māori names, especially in the north and central regions of the North Island. The [[Royal Geographical Society of London]] was responsible for place names until 1894 when authority was given to the [[Governor of New Zealand]].<ref name ="FIG"/> The future [[Prime Minister of New Zealand | Prime Minister]] [[Joseph Ward]] moved an [[Amend (motion)|amendment]] in 1894 that gave preference to Māori names for any new features and allowed the alteration of misspelt names (although this did not always occur). In 1924 the Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand was set up{{by whom?|date=December 2018}} to advise on place names, and in 1946 the [[New Zealand Parliament]] established the [[New Zealand Geographic Board]] (NZGB) and gave it power to change or implement Māori and English names.<ref name ="FIG"/> Anyone can propose a geographical name to the Board, which consults local Māori and allows public submissions before determining if a name should be made official.<ref>{{cite web|title= Process For New Zealand Official Geographic Names|publisher= New Zealand Geographic Board (Ngā Pou Taunahao Aotearoa)|url= http://www.positionzonline.co.nz/docs/placenames/proposingaplacename/flowcharts/nz-names-process-200607.pdf|format= pdf|accessdate= 19 March 2011}}</ref> Names can also be made official through an [[Act of Parliament]].

The NZGB encourages the use of original Māori names and has given some places official double names. These can be expressed as alternative names where officially either name could be used ([[Mount Taranaki or Mount Egmont]]) or dual names where both names should be used together ([[Matiu / Somes Island]]).<ref>{{cite web|first= Malcolm|last= McKinnon|title= Place names – Māori and Pākehā names|publisher= Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date= November 2009|url= http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/place-names/7|accessdate= 24 February 2011}}</ref> In 1998, as a result of the settling of the [[Ngai Tahu]] [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements |Treaty claim]], New Zealand's tallest mountain officially became [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.beehive.govt.nz/feature/ngai-tahu-settlement-260|title= NZ Government Executive Ngai Tahu Settlement |accessdate= 27 February 2011|publisher= New Zealand Government Executive|author= Doug Graham}}</ref> There are also a few English dual names, with [[Wellington Harbour]] also officially known as Port Nicholson.<ref>{{cite web |title= Kairangi Name Proposals go to Public Consultation|date= August 2010|url= http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/about-geographic-board/nzgb-news-notices/2010/0508-kairangi-name-proposals/index.aspx|publisher= Land Information New Zealand|accessdate= 1 April 2011}}</ref>

Māori groups have campaigned to correct inaccurately-spelled or -pronounced [[Māori-language]] place names.

The spelling "Wanganui" may have originated to reflect the [[dialect]]al pronunciation of local Māori, who pronounce 'wh' (an "f"-like sound in other dialects) as {{IPA|[ˀw]}} – a [[glottal stop| glottalised]] "w".

== European names ==

[[File:George Edward Grey.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Grey River]], [[Mount Grey / Maukatere|Mount Grey]], [[Greytown, New Zealand|Greytown]], [[Greymouth]] and [[Grey Lynn]] all derive their name from [[Sir George Grey]]|alt=Black and White photograph of Sir George Grey]]
Tasman named a few geographic features as he sailed along New Zealand's west coast. Many such as [[Golden Bay|Murderers Bay]] did not last, while some like [[Cape Maria van Diemen]] (the wife of the governor of [[Jakarta|Batavia]]) and [[Three Kings Islands]] are still in use. Cook named many more on his voyage, including [[Bay of Islands]], [[Bay of Plenty]], [[Poverty Bay]], [[Cape Farewell, New Zealand|Cape Farewell]], [[Queen Charlotte Sound (New Zealand)|Queen Charlotte Sound]], [[Mount Egmont]] and [[Banks Peninsula]]. [[Cape Kidnappers]] commemorates a Māori attempt to kidnap one of Cook's crew members. [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] named [[French Pass]] after sailing through it. The explorers lent their names to many places, including [[Mount Tasman]], [[Tasman Glacier]], the [[Tasman Region]], [[Cook Strait]], [[Mount Cook]] and [[d'Urville Island (New Zealand)|d'Urville Island]]. The [[HMS Malabar (1804)|''Coromandel'']], [[HMS Chatham (1788)|''Chatham'']] and ''Pegasus'' ships visited New Zealand's shores between 1791 and 1820 and were used to name [[Coromandel Peninsula]], [[Chatham Islands]], [[Pegasus Bay]] and [[Port Pegasus]]. [[Stewart Island]] was named after the first officer aboard the ''Pegasus''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Malcolm|last=McKinnon|title=Place names – Early explorers|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=March 2009|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/place-names/2|accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref>

Most European names came during the 1840s to the 1910s and were given by surveyors who worked for colonising associations or provincial governments. Names acknowledged the colonising associations sponsors ([[Hutt Valley, New Zealand|Hutt Valley]], [[Wakefield, New Zealand|Wakefield]], [[Port Chalmers]], [[Ashburton, New Zealand|Ashburton]]), ships ([[Bombay Hills|Bombay]]), government officials ([[Featherston, New Zealand|Featherston]], [[Rolleston, New Zealand|Rolleston]], [[Invercargill]]), politicians ([[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]], [[Fox Glacier]], [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]]) and church leaders ([[Selwyn District|Selwyn]]).<ref>{{cite web|first=Malcolm|last=McKinnon|title=Place names – Colonial naming|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=November 2009|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/place-names/3|accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref> Military heroes and famous battles were popular place names, with [[Auckland]], [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]], [[Havelock, New Zealand|Havelock]], [[Wellington]], [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]], [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]]. British politicians and royalty lent their names to [[Russell, New Zealand|Russell]], [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]], [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]], [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] and [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]], while [[Franz Josef, New Zealand|Franz Josef]] is named after the Austrian emperor. Royal names are more popular for streets than towns or geographical features, although both [[Mount Victoria, Auckland|Auckland]] and [[Mount Victoria, Wellington|Wellington have Mount Victoria]]. [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]] is named after governor [[Thomas Gore Browne]] and [[George Grey]]'s name is used for [[Greytown, New Zealand|Greytown]], [[Greymouth]], [[Grey Lynn]] and many natural features. Relatively few names are derived from British towns, with [[Dunedin]] (after [[Edinburgh]]—''Dùn Éideann'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]]<ref>http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Gaelic/placenamesC-E.pdf</ref>), [[New Plymouth]] and the [[Canterbury Province]] among the most notable.<ref>{{cite web|first=Malcolm|last=McKinnon|title=Place names – The imperial connection|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=March 2009|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/place-names/4|accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref>

Many inland locations (including [[Helensville]], [[Dargaville]], [[Morrinsville]], [[Bulls, New Zealand|Bulls]], [[Masterton]] and [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]]) were named after the early settlers. [[Mackenzie Country]] takes its name from a [[James Mckenzie (outlaw)|sheep stealer]] and [[King Country]] references the region where the [[Māori king]] defied colonial government for many years. Mountains and [[Mountain pass|passes]] were named after their discoverers ([[Haast Pass|Haast]], [[Lewis Pass|Lewis]]) or scientists ([[Mount Newton, New Zealand|Newton]], [[Mount Lyell, New Zealand|Lyell]]). Other names were descriptive, such as [[Woodville, New Zealand|Woodville]], [[Island Bay]], [[Riverton, New Zealand|Riverton]], [[Whitecliffs]] and [[Bluff, New Zealand|Bluff]].<ref name = "Local Naming">{{cite web|first=Malcolm|last=McKinnon|title=Place names – Local naming|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=March 2009|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/place-names/5|accessdate= 22 February 2011}}</ref> A few derive their names from descriptions in languages other than English or Māori, for example: [[Miramar, New Zealand|Miramar]], which means "sea view" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; and [[Inchbonnie]], which means "beautiful" (''bonnie'' in Lallands) "island" (''innis'' in Scottish Gaelic).

=== Regional patterns ===

Many Scottish names occur in [[Otago]] and [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] (the [[Lammermoor Range|Lammerlaws]], [[Invercargill]], [[Wedderburn, New Zealand|Wedderburn]], [[Glenfalloch]]) and Scottish settlers also named [[Riccarton, New Zealand|Riccarton]] and the [[Avon River (Canterbury)|Avon River]] in [[Christchurch]]. [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] has an English flavour to its nomenclature with Christchurch and [[Oxford, New Zealand|Oxford]], but also contains [[Belfast, New Zealand|Belfast]] and French names throughout the [[Akaroa]] area. Scandinavian migrants left their mark in the [[Seventy Mile Bush]] with [[Dannevirke]] and [[Norsewood]]<ref name = "Local Naming"/> and some of the suburbs and streets of Auckland and Wellington reflect Australian immigration (Footscray and [[Botany Downs, New Zealand|Botany Downs]]). There is very little Asian influence in New Zealand place naming, with [[Khandallah]] in Wellington and [[Cashmere, New Zealand|Cashmere]] ([[Kashmir]]) in Christchurch, reflecting British imperial connections rather than Indian influence.<ref>{{cite web|first=Malcolm|last=McKinnon|title=Place names – Omissions and minor influences|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=March 2009|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/place-names/8|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref>

== Unofficial names ==

Many of New Zealand's place names have never been officially approved by the NZGB. They either fall outside the board's jurisdiction (homesteads, lighthouses) or were common names before the board was established and have never been officially formalised. Unofficial recorded names are defined as "names that have appeared in at least two publicly available authoritative publications or databases".<ref name = "Help">{{cite web|url=http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/find-names/researching-names/index.aspx|title=Help finding names|publisher=Land Information New Zealand|accessdate= 19 March 2011}}</ref> Recorded names include major cities (Wellington, Auckland, Hamilton, Christchurch), mountains ([[Mount Tasman]], [[Mount Dampier]]), islands ([[Auckland Islands]], [[Great Barrier Island]]) and many other geographical features.{{#tag:ref|Recorded names were obtained by comparing names found in the New Zealand Place Names Database<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/find-names/topographic-names-db/index.aspx|title=New Zealand Place Names Database|publisher=Land Information New Zealand|accessdate=20 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312122944/http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/find-names/topographic-names-db/index.aspx|archivedate=12 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but not recorded in the New Zealand Gazetteer of Official Geographic Names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/find-names/nz-gazetteer-official-names/index.aspx|title=New Zealand Gazetteer of Official Geographic Names|publisher=Land Information New Zealand|accessdate= 20 March 2011}}</ref>|group=n}}

New Zealand and various parts of it have acquired a range of colloquial names over the years. Unofficial late 19th century names for New Zealand included "Maoriland" and "[[God's Own Country]]".<ref>{{cite web|first=Jock|last= Phillips|title=The New Zealanders – Maorilanders|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=March 2009|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/the-new-zealanders/5|accessdate= 27 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bracken, Thomas (1843–1898)|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogBr-By.html|publisher=Dictionary of Australian Biography|accessdate= 27 February 2011}}</ref> The former occurred widely in the [[labour movement]] and an early labour newspaper was named the ''[[Maoriland Worker]]''. [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Premier]] [[Richard John Seddon]] (in power 1893–1906) popularised "God's Own Country".

Many cities and towns have nicknames based on a prominent feature or one which promoters wish to emphasise. Christchurch is promoted as the "Garden City"<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to Christchurch, the Garden City|publisher=[[Christchurch City Council]]|url=http://www.christchurch.org.nz/ |accessdate= 27 February 2011}}</ref> and Auckland is commonly referred to as the "city of sails".<ref>{{cite news|title=Auckland: City of sails |first=Suzanne|last= McFadden|date=25 August 2010| work=New Zealand Herald|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10666744}}</ref> Various councils have come up with mottos to advertise their cities, with Hamilton going from "Where It's Happening" to "More Than You Expect" in 2000<ref>{{cite news|title=Hamilton expects slogan dividends|date=31 Mar 2000|first=Paul|last=Yandall|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=128387}}</ref> and Dunedin using the "[[I am Dunedin]]" slogan from 2001 until 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dunedin looks for new slogan|date=11 January 2010|newspaper=Otago Daily Times|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/88648/dunedin-looks-new-slogan}}</ref> Hamilton acquired the nickname "the Tron" after "Hamiltron: City of the Future" was suggested for a city slogan.<ref>{{cite news|first=Hazel|last=Phillips|date=30 November 2009 |title=Monday News Munchies: Hamiltron has the goods|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/hazel-phillips/monday-news-munchies-hamiltron-has-goods|newspaper=[[National Business Review]]}}</ref> Wellington is also known as the "windy city" due to its strong and unpredictable winds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/ottawa-group-2011/about-wellington.aspx|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate= 27 February 2011|title=All About Wellington}}</ref>

Following the release of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' films]], New Zealand has sometimes been called "Middle-earth" after the [[Middle-earth|fictional setting]] of the films. [[Wellington]], the centre of the films' production, was sometimes called Middle-earth, and for about a week around the release of the first movie the local newspaper ''[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]]'' renamed itself to ''The Middle Earth Post''. The town of [[Matamata]], near the location of many of the [[Hobbiton]] scenes, unofficially renamed itself "Hobbiton".<ref>{{cite web|title=Lord of the Rings: Magic for New Zealand Tourism?|date=19 Dec 2001|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/12/1218_wirenewzearing.html|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> The flourishing of the film-industry in Wellington has led to the nickname "[[Wellywood]]", and a proposal to erect a "[[Hollywood]]" style sign near the airport was overturned due to public resistance and possible copyright infringements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/national-news/3532763/|title=Airport backs down over 'Wellywood' sign|date= 31 March 2010|newspaper=Southland Times|location=New Zealand}}</ref>

A number of towns have acquired ironic nicknames comparing them to the "more exciting" city of [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]; "Rotovegas" for [[Rotorua]],<ref>{{cite news|authorlink=Lynn Barber|first=Lynn|last=Barber|title=Just the spot... for jumping off a cliff|newspaper=Guardian Unlimited|date=27 May 2002|url=http://travel.guardian.co.uk/article/2002/may/27/newzealand.extremesportsholidays}}</ref> "Ashvegas" for [[Ashburton, New Zealand|Ashburton]] and "Invervegas" for [[Invercargill]].{{sfn|Hay, Maclagan and Gordon|p=81}} Other areas have nicknames or popular designations based on abbreviations or mangling of the Māori name. New Zealanders will sometimes refer to the [[Taranaki Region]] as "The Naki",<ref>{{cite news|title=TVNZ's Toni ties the knot in the 'Naki|date= 6 Dec 2009|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/personalities/news/article.cfm?c_id=72&objectid=10613691}}</ref> [[Palmerston North]] as "Palmy", Gisborne as "Gizzie", [[Cardrona, New Zealand|Cardrona]] as "Cardie",<ref>{{cite web|first=Malcolm|last= McKinnon|title=Place names – Naming after 1920|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=March 2009|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/place-names/6|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> [[Paraparaumu]] as "Paraparam", [[Waimakariri District|Waimakariri]] as "Waimak" and [[Paekakariki]] as "Pie-cock".{{sfn|Hay, Maclagan and Gordon|p=72}}

[[Waikikamukau]] (/waɪkɪkɑːmuːkaʊ/, as if saying "Why kick a moo-cow") is a generic name for a small rural town or locality in New Zealand.
