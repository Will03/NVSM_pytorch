In [[philology]], '''decipherment''' is the discovery of the meaning of texts written in ancient or obscure languages or scripts.<ref>Trask, R.L (2000). ''The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics''. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, p. 82 ("The process of determining the relation between an extinct and unknown writing system and the language it represents. Strictly, decipherment is the elucidation of the ''script''—that is, determining the values of the written characters")</ref>  Decipherment in [[cryptography]] refers to [[decryption]].<ref>Vaudenay, Serge (2006). ''A Classical Introduction to Cryptography''. Springer, p.3. ("Action to transform a ciphertext into a plaintext by an ''authorized party'' [emphasis added]")</ref> The term is used sardonically in everyday language to describe attempts to read poor handwriting.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decipherment</ref> In [[genetics]], decipherment is the successful attempt to understand [[DNA]], which is viewed metaphorically as a text containing word-like units.<ref>Snustad, D. Peter, et al. (2016). ''Principles of Genetics''. Wiley, p.302</ref> Throughout science the term decipherment is synonymous with the understanding of biological and chemical phenomena.

==Ancient languages==
In a few cases, a multilingual artifact has been necessary to facilitate decipherment, the [[Rosetta Stone]] being the classic example. Statistical techniques provide another pathway to decipherment, as does the analysis of modern languages derived from ancient languages in which undeciphered texts are written. Archaeological and historical information is helpful in verifying hypothesized decipherments.
