'''Polari''' (or alternatively '''Parlare''', '''Parlary''', '''Palare''', '''Palarie''', '''Palari'''; {{ety|it|parlare|to talk}}) is a form of [[cant (language)|cant]] [[slang]] used in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by some actors, circus and fairground showmen, [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestlers]], merchant navy sailors, [[Crime|criminals]], prostitutes, and the [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|gay subculture]].

==Description==
[[File:Polari Rainbow Plaque.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leeds_Pride#Rainbow_Plaques|Rainbow Plaque]] on [[Leeds City Varieties]] theatre]]
Polari is a mixture of Romance ([[Italian language|Italian]]<ref name="BritishSpiesLicensed">"[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1833896,00.html?cnn=yes British Spies: Licensed to be Gay]." ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. 19 August 2008. Retrieved 9 May 2018.</ref> or [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]]), [[Romani language|Romani]], [[London slang]],<ref name="BritishSpiesLicensed"/> [[Back slang|backslang]], [[rhyming slang]], sailor slang, and [[thieves' cant]]. Later it expanded to contain words from the [[Yiddish language]] and from 1960s [[drug subculture]] slang. It was a constantly developing form of language, with a small core lexicon of about 20 words, including: ''{{lang|pld|bona}}'' (good <ref name="liverpoolmuseums.org.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/visit/floor-plan/life-at-sea/gaylife/polari.aspx|title=The secret language of polari - Merseyside Maritime Museum, Liverpool museums|website=Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>), ''{{lang|pld|ajax}}'' (nearby), ''{{lang|pld|eek}}'' (face), ''{{lang|pld|cod}}'' (bad, in the sense of tacky or vile), ''{{lang|pld|naff}}'' (bad, in the sense of drab or dull, though borrowed into mainstream British English with the sense of the aforementioned ''{{lang|pld|cod}}''), ''{{lang|pld|lattie}}'' (room, house, flat, i.e. room to let), ''{{lang|pld|nanti}}'' (not, no), ''{{lang|pld|omi}}'' (man), ''{{lang|pld|palone}}'' (woman), ''{{lang|pld|riah}}'' (hair), ''{{lang|pld|zhoosh}}'' or ''{{lang|pld|tjuz}}'' (smarten up, stylize), ''{{lang|pld|TBH}}'' ('to be had', sexually accessible), ''{{lang|pld|trade}}'' (sex), and ''{{lang|pld|vada}}'' (see), and over 500 other lesser-known words.<ref>Baker, Paul (2002) Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang. London: Continuum {{ISBN|0-8264-5961-7}}</ref> According to a [[Channel 4]] television documentary,<ref>David McKenna, ''A Storm in a Teacup'', Channel 4 Television, 1993.</ref> there was once (in London) an "[[East End of London|East End]]" version which stressed Cockney [[rhyming slang]] and a "[[West End of London|West End]]" version which stressed theatrical and Classical influences. There was some interchange between the two.

==Usage==
Since the 19th century, Polari was used in London fishmarkets, the theatre, fairgrounds, and circuses, hence the many borrowings from [[Romani language|Romani]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37115577|title=It's not unusual : a history of lesbian and gay Britain in the twentieth century|last=1957-|first=Jivani, Alkarim,|isbn=0253333482|location=Bloomington|oclc=37115577}}</ref> As many homosexual men worked in theatrical entertainment it was also used among the gay subculture, at a time when homosexual activity was illegal, to disguise homosexuals from hostile outsiders and [[undercover police]]men. It was also used extensively in the British [[Merchant navy|Merchant Navy]], where many gay men joined [[ocean liner]]s and [[cruise ships]] as waiters, stewards, and entertainers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/visit/floor-plan/life-at-sea/gaylife/ |title=Gay men in the Merchant Marine |publisher=[[Liverpool Maritime Museum]] |accessdate=9 May 2018 }}</ref>

[[William Shakespeare]] used the term ''bona'' (good, attractive) in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', part of the expression ''bona roba'' (a lady wearing an attractive outfit).<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/dec/10/life1.lifemagazine3 |author=Beverley D'Silva |work=[[The Observer]] |title=Mind your language |date=10 December 2000 |accessdate=9 May 2018 }}</ref> However, "there's little [other] written evidence of Polari before the 1890s," according to [[Peter Gilliver]], associate editor of the ''Oxford English Dictionary''. The dictionary's entry for rozzer (policeman), for example, includes this quote from an 1893 book (P. H. Emerson's ''Signor Lippo - Burnt Cork Artiste''):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://word-ancestry.livejournal.com/71450.html#/71450.html|title=Historical Origins of English Words and Phrases|website=[[Live Journal]]|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> "If the rozzers was to see him in bona clobber they'd take him for a gun." (If the police were to see him dressed in this fine manner, they would know that he is a thief).<ref name=guardian/>

The almost identical '''Parlyaree''' has been spoken in fairgrounds since at least the 17th century<ref>Partridge, Eric (1937) ''Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English''</ref> and continues to be used by show travellers in England and Scotland. As theatrical booths, circus acts, and menageries were once a common part of European fairs, it is likely that the roots of Polari/Parlyaree lie in the period before both theatre and circus became independent of the fairgrounds. The Parlyaree spoken on fairgrounds tends to borrow much more from Romany, as well as other languages and [[argot]]s spoken by travelling people, such as [[cant (language)|cant]] and [[backslang]].

[[Henry Mayhew]] gave a verbatim account of Polari as part of an interview with a [[Punch and Judy]] showman in the 1850s. The discussion he recorded references the arrival of Punch in England, crediting these early shows to a performer from Italy called Porcini ([[John Payne Collier]]'s account calls him Porchini).<ref>''Punch and Judy''. [[John Payne Collier]]; with Illustrations by George Cruickshank. London: Thomas Hailes Lacey, 1859.</ref> Mayhew provides the following:
<blockquote>
''Punch Talk''<br/>
"'{{lang|pld|Bona Parle}}' means language; name of patter. '{{lang|pld|Yeute munjare}}' – no food. '{{lang|pld|Yeute lente}}' – no bed. '{{lang|pld|Yeute bivare}}' – no drink. I've '{{lang|pld|yeute munjare}},' and '{{lang|pld|yeute bivare}},' and, what's worse, '{{lang|pld|yeute lente}}.' This is better than the costers' talk, because that ain't no slang and all, and this is a broken Italian, and much higher than the costers' lingo. We know what o'clock it is, besides."<ref name="Mayhew"/></blockquote>
There are additional accounts of particular words that relate to puppet performance: "'{{lang|pld|Slumarys}}' – figures, frame, scenes, properties. '{{lang|pld|Slum}}' – call, or unknown tongue"<ref name="Mayhew"/> ("unknown" is a reference to the "[[swazzle]]", a voice modifier used by Punch performers, the structure of which was a longstanding trade secret).

==Decline in use==
Polari had begun to fall into disuse amongst the gay subculture by the late 1960s. The popularity of the [[Julian and Sandy]] characters played by [[Hugh Paddick]] and [[Kenneth Williams]] (first introduced in the radio programme ''Round the Horne'' in the 1960s)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/17/gayrights.comment|title=Colin Richardson: Polari, the gay slang, is being revived.|first=Colin|last=Richardson|date=17 January 2005|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref> ensured that some of this secret language became public knowledge. In addition, the need for a secret subculture code declined with the partial decriminalization of adult homosexual acts in England and Wales under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]].

==In popular culture==
[[File:Bona Togs shop Jersey.jpg|thumb|''Bona Togs'' clothes shop]]
Polari was popularised in the 1960s on the popular BBC radio show ''[[Round the Horne]]'' starring [[Kenneth Horne]]. [[camp (style)|Camp]] Polari-speaking characters [[Julian and Sandy]] were played by [[Hugh Paddick]] and [[Kenneth Williams]].<ref name="Stevens">{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=Christopher|title=Born Brilliant: The Life Of Kenneth Williams|publisher=John Murray|year=2010|isbn=1-84854-195-3|page=206}}</ref>

In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Carnival of Monsters]]'' from 1973, Vorg, a showman, believing the Doctor to also be a showman, attempts to converse with him in Polari. The Doctor states that he does not understand him.{{sfn|Baker|2003|p=161}}

In 1987 character Ralph Filthy, a ''Theatrical Agent'' played by [[Nigel Planer]] in the BBC TV series ''[[Filthy, Rich & Catflap]]'' regularly used Polari.

In 1990, [[Morrissey]] released the single "[[Piccadilly Palare]]" containing a number of lyrics in Polari and exploring a subculture in which Polari was used. "Piccadilly Palare" is also the first song appearing on Morrissey's compilation album ''[[Bona Drag]]'', whose title is itself taken from Polari.

In the 1999 film ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]'', two characters speak Polari while in a London nightclub. This scene contains subtitles for viewers not familiar with the language.

In 2015, filmmakers Brian Fairbairn and Karl Eccleston made ''Putting on the Dish'', a short film entirely in Polari.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/07/28/polari_the_gay_dialect_can_be_heard_in_this_great_short_film_putting_on.html|

In 2016, [[David Bowie]] released the album ''[[Blackstar_(album)|Blackstar]]'', containing the song "[[Girl Loves Me]]". Polari makes up half of the lyrics of the track.

In 2017, a service at [[Westcott House, Cambridge]] (a [[Church of England]] [[theological college]]) was conducted in Polari; the service was held by trainee priests to commemorate [[LGBT History Month]]; following media attention, [[Chris Chivers]], the Principal, expressed his regret.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38863545|title=Church 'regret' as trainees hold service in gay slang|date=4 February 2017|publisher=[[BBC News]]|language=en-GB|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/03/church-of-england-college-apologises-students-queer-evening-prayer|title=C of E college apologises for students' attempt to 'queer evening prayer'|author=Sherwood, Harriet|date=3 February 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/church-of-england-gay-slang-language-service-regret-lgbt-commemoration-regret-polari-westcott-house-a7562561.html|author=Flood, Rebecca|title=Church expresses ‘huge regret’ after Cambridge LGBT commemoration service held in gay slang language|work=[[The Independent]]|date=4 February 2017|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/02/04/priests-delivered-a-service-in-hilarious-gay-slang-but-the-church-werent-happy-6426464/|author=Robb, Simon|title=Priests delivered a service in gay slang and the church weren't happy|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=4 February 2017|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> In the 2017 EP ''Ricky'', [[Sakima (singer)|Sakima]] sang about heteronormativity and Polari.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/7989245/sakima-pop-outspoken-queer-voice-interview|title=Sakima's Dirty Pop: Meet Music's New Queer Voice|last=Crowley|first=Patrick|date=2017-10-09|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref>

In 2002, two books on Polari were published, ''Polari: The Lost Language of Gay Men'', and ''Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang'' (both by Paul Baker).

In 2012, artists Jez Dolan and [[Joseph Richardson (English artist)|Joseph Richardson]] created an iPhone app which makes available the Polari lexicon and a comprehensive list of etymologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/take-polari-safari|title=Take a Polari safari|date=24 November 2013|website=Neurope.eu|accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{itunes|gb/app/polari/id547241282|Polari}}</ref>

==Entry into mainstream slang==
A number of words from Polari have entered mainstream slang. The list below includes words in general use with the meanings listed: ''acdc'', ''barney'', ''blag'', ''butch'', ''camp'', ''khazi'', ''cottaging'', ''hoofer'', ''mince'', ''ogle'', ''scarper'', ''slap'', ''strides'', ''tod'', ''[rough] trade''.

The Polari word ''{{lang|pld|naff}}'', meaning inferior or tacky, has an uncertain etymology. [[Michael Quinion]] states that it is probably from the sixteenth-century Italian word ''{{lang|it|gnaffa}}'', meaning "a despicable person".<ref name="quinaff">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-naf1.htm|title=Naff|author=Quinion, Michael|work=[[World Wide Words]]|accessdate=10 January 2010}}</ref> There are a number of [[False etymology|false etymologies]], many based on acronyms—Not Available For Fucking, Normal As Fuck—though these are [[backronym]]s. More likely etymologies include northern UK [[dialect]] ''naffhead'', ''naffin'', or ''naffy'', a simpleton or blockhead; ''niffy-naffy'', inconsequential, stupid, or Scots ''nyaff'', a term of contempt for any unpleasant or objectionable person. An alternative etymology may lie in the [[Romany language|Romany]] ''{{lang|rom|naflo}}'', itself rooted in ''násfalo'', meaning ill. The phrase "naff off" was used [[euphemism|euphemistically]] in place of "fuck off" along with the [[intensifier]] "naffing" in ''[[Billy Liar]]'' by [[Keith Waterhouse]] (1959).<ref name=billy1>{{cite book|author=Waterhouse, Keith|title=Billy Liar|publisher=[[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]]|year=1959|pages=35, 46|isbn=0-7181-1155-9}}
''p35'' "Naff off, Stamp, for Christ sake!"&nbsp;''p46'' "Well which one of them's got the naffing engagement ring?"</ref> Usage of "naff" increased in the 1970s when [[television]] [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Porridge (TV)|Porridge]]'' employed it as an alternative to expletives which were not considered broadcastable at the time.<ref name=quinaff/> [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] famously told a reporter, "Why don't you just naff off" at the Badminton horse trials in April 1982.<ref>''The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'' Dalzell and Victor (eds.)

==Polari in use==
''Omies and palones of the [[jury]], vada well at the eek of the poor ome who stands before you, his lallies trembling.''—taken from "Bona Law", a ''[[Round The Horne]]'' sketch written by [[Barry Took]] and [[Marty Feldman]]

:Translation: "Men and women of the jury, look well at the face of the poor man who stands before you, his legs trembling."

''So bona to vada...oh you! Your lovely eek and your lovely riah.''—taken from "Piccadilly Palare", a song by [[Morrissey]]

:Translation: "So good to see...oh you! Your lovely face and your lovely hair."

''As feely ommes...we would zhoosh our riah, powder our eeks, climb into our bona new drag, don our batts and troll off to some bona bijou bar. In the bar we would stand around with our sisters, vada the bona cartes on the butch omme ajax who, if we fluttered our ogle riahs at him sweetly, might just troll over to offer a light for the unlit vogue clenched between our teeth.''—taken from ''Parallel Lives'', the memoirs of renowned gay journalist [[Peter Burton (journalist)|Peter Burton]]

:Translation: "As young men...we would style our hair, powder our faces, climb into our great new clothes, don our shoes and wander/walk off to some great little bar. In the bar we would stand around with our gay companions, look at the great genitals on the butch man nearby who, if we fluttered our eyelashes at him sweetly, might just wander/walk over to offer a light for the unlit [[cigarette]] clenched between our teeth."

In the ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' episode "The Old Order Changes", Captain Peacock asks Mr Humphries to get "some strides for the omi with the naff riah" (i.e. trousers for the fellow with the unstylish hair).<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Old Order Changes|series=Are You Being Served?|date=18 March 1977}}</ref>
