'''Multilingualism''' is the use of more than one [[language]], either by an individual speaker or by a community of speakers.

Multilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood, the so-called [[first language]] (L1). The first language (sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue) is acquired without formal education, by [[Language acquisition|mechanisms]] about which scholars disagree. Children acquiring two languages from these early years are called simultaneous bilinguals. Even in the case of simultaneous bilinguals, one language is usually dominant.

People who know more than one language have been reported to be more adept at language learning compared to monolinguals.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |title=The bilingual advantage in novel word learning |vauthors=Kaushanskaya M, Marian V |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=705–710 |year=2009 |doi=10.3758/PBR.16.4.705 }}</ref>

Multilingualism in computing can be considered part of a continuum between [[internationalization and localization]]. Due to the status of [[English in computing]], software development nearly always uses it (but see also [[Non-English-based programming languages]]). Almost all commercial software is initially available in an English version, and multilingual versions, if any, may be produced as alternative options based on the English original.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Definition ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
The definition of multilingualism is a subject of debate in the same way as the definition of language fluency.  On one end of a sort of linguistic continuum, one may define multilingualism as complete competence and mastery in another language. The speaker would presumably have complete knowledge and control over the language so as to sound native. On the opposite end of the spectrum would be people who know enough phrases to get around as a tourist using the alternate language. Since 1992, [[Vivian Cook (academic)|Vivian Cook]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viviancook.uk/Writings/Papers/MCentry.htm|title=Multi-competence definition|author=|date=|website=www.viviancook.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022003750/http://www.viviancook.uk/Writings/Papers/MCentry.htm|archivedate=22 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> has argued that most multilingual speakers fall somewhere between minimal and maximal definitions.<ref name="ParadowskiBator2016">{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB, Bator A |title=Perceived effectiveness of language acquisition in the process of multilingual upbringing by parents of different nationalities |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858 |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |pages=1–19 |year=2016 |doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101022728/http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858 |archivedate=1 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Cook calls these people ''multi-competent''.
In addition, there is no consistent definition of what constitutes a distinct language. For instance, scholars often disagree whether [[Scots language|Scots]] is a language in its own right or a dialect of [[English language|English]].<ref>[[A.J. Aitken]] in ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press 1992. p.894</ref> Furthermore, what is considered a language can change, often for purely political purposes, such as when [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was created as a [[standard language]] on the basis of the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] to function as [[Dachsprache|umbrella]] for numerous [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] dialects, and after the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]] was split into [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], or when [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was dismissed as a Russian dialect by the Russian [[tsar]]s to discourage national feelings.<ref>[[Ems Ukaz]]</ref>
Many small independent nations' schoolchildren are today compelled to learn multiple languages because of international interactions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foreign-language.org/|title=Writing With English As A Second Language|publisher=Foreign-Language.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421235102/http://foreign-language.org/|archivedate=21 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> For example, in Finland, all children are required to learn at least two foreign languages: the other national language (Swedish or Finnish) and one alien language (usually English). Many Finnish schoolchildren also select further languages, such as German or Russian.

In some large nations with multiple languages, such as India, schoolchildren may routinely learn multiple languages based on where they reside in the country. In major metropolitan areas of Central, Southern and Eastern India, many children may be fluent in four languages (the mother tongue, the state language, and the official languages of India, Hindi and English). Thus, a child of Telugu parents living in Bangalore will end up speaking his or her mother tongue (Telugu) at home and the state language (Kannada), Hindi and English in school and life.

In many countries, bilingualism occurs through international communications and English being the global [[lingua franca]], which sometimes results in majority bilingualism even when the countries often have just one domestic official language. This is occurring especially in Germanic regions such as [[Scandinavia]], the [[Benelux]] and among [[German language|Germanophones]], but it is also expanding into some non-Germanic countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.europelanguagejobs.com/blog/english-who-speaks-it-best.php|title=English as a second language: Who in Europe speaks it best?|publisher=Europe Language Jobs|date=31 July 2018|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>

==Myths surrounding multilingualism==
Many myths and much prejudice has grown around the notions of bi- and multilingualism in some Western countries where monolingualism is the norm. Researchers from the UK and Poland have listed the most common misconceptions:<ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/>
* that bi- or multilinguals are exceptions to the ‘default’ monolingual ‘norm’;
* that in order to deserve the label ‘bi-/multilingual’, one needs to have an equal, ‘perfect’, ‘nativelike’ command of both/all of one's languages;
* that childhood bilingualism may be detrimental to both linguistic and cognitive development and consequently lead to poorer results at school;
* that exposing a child to more than one language may cause language impairment or deficits, or that for children already diagnosed with impairments two languages mean too much unnecessary pressure and effort;
* that the children do not have enough time to learn both languages, therefore it is better if they only acquire the majority language.
* that the children would be confused with having the ability to speak two languages and the “tip-of-the-tongue states” For instance, where one knows the meaning and the specific details of a word, but cannot retrieve a word. 
* those bilingual individuals tend to have slightly fewer vocabularies and weaker in “verbal fluency tasks” than the monolingual counterpart 
These are all harmful convictions which have long been debunked,<ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/> yet still persist among many parents.

==Multilingual individuals==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
A multilingual person is someone who can communicate in more than one language, either actively (through speaking, writing, or signing) or passively (through listening, reading, or perceiving). More specifically, the terms ''bilingual'' and ''trilingual'' are used to describe comparable situations in which two or three languages are involved. A multilingual person is generally referred to as a [[polyglotism|polyglot]].
Multilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood, the so-called [[first language]] (L1). The first language (sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue) is acquired without formal education, by mechanisms heavily disputed. Children acquiring two languages in this way are called simultaneous bilinguals. Even in the case of simultaneous bilinguals, one language usually dominates over the other.<ref name="auto">Hult, F.M. (2014).  Covert bilingualism and symbolic competence: Analytical reflections on negotiating insider/outsider positionality in Swedish speech situations. ''Applied Linguistics, 35''(1), 63-81.</ref>
In linguistics, first language acquisition is closely related to the concept of a "native speaker". According to a view widely held by linguists, a native speaker of a given language has in some respects a level of skill which a second (or subsequent) language learner cannot easily accomplish. Consequently, descriptive empirical studies of languages are usually carried out using only native speakers. This view is, however, slightly problematic, particularly as many non-native speakers demonstrably not only successfully engage with and in their non-native language societies, but in fact may become culturally and even linguistically important contributors (as, for example, writers, politicians, media personalities and performing artists) in their non-native language. In recent years, linguistic research has focused attention on the use of widely known world languages, such as English, as a [[lingua franca]] or a shared common language of professional and commercial communities. In lingua franca situations, most speakers of the common language are functionally multilingual.

When acquisition of the first language is interrupted and insufficient or unstructured language input follows from the second language, as sometimes happens with [[Immigration|immigrant]] children, the speaker can end up with two languages both mastered below the monolingual standard.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} A notable example can be found in the [[Bengali people|ethnic Bengali]] Muslim community of Assam province in India, hailing from [[Bangladesh|East Bengal]]. Their mother tongue is [[Bengali language|Bengali]], but they have no opportunity to study it in the school. Their medium language of study is [[Assamese language|Assamese]], the provincial language. As a result, their predominant form of communication mixes the mother tongue and the medium language. Because they have no chance to study both the languages separately, they can't differentiate between the two or maintain such a difference in expression. Literacy plays an important role in the development of language in these immigrant children.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Those who were literate in their first language before arriving, and who have support to maintain that literacy, are at the very least able to maintain and master their first language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} There are differences between those who learn a language in a class environment and those who learn through total [[language immersion|immersion]], usually living in a country where the target language is widely spoken. Without the possibility to actively translate, due to a complete lack of any first language communication opportunity, the comparison between languages is reduced. The new language is almost independently learned, like the mother tongue for a child, with direct concept-to-language translation that can become more natural than word structures learned as a subject. Added to this, the uninterrupted, immediate and exclusive practice of the new language reinforces and deepens the attained knowledge.

===Economic benefits===
Bilinguals might have important labor market advantages over monolingual individuals as bilingual people are able to carry out duties that monolinguals cannot, such as interacting with customers who only speak a minority language. A study in Switzerland has found that multilingualism is positively correlated with an individual's salary, the productivity of firms, and the gross domestic production (GDP); the authors state that Switzerland's GDP is augmented by 10% by multilingualism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grin|first1=François|last2=Sfreddo|first2=Claudio|last3=Vaillancourt|first3=François|title=Economics of the multilingual workplace.|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0-415-85106-0}}</ref> A study in the United States by Agirdag found that bilingualism has substantial economic benefits as bilingual persons were found to have around $3,000 per year more salary than monolinguals.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Agirdag, O. |title=The long-term effects of bilingualism on children of immigration: student bilingualism and future earnings |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=449–464 |year=2014  |doi=10.1080/13670050.2013.816264 }}</ref>

===Receptive bilingualism===
{{Main|Passive speakers (language)}}
Receptive bilinguals are those who have the ability to understand a second language but who cannot speak it or whose abilities to speak it are inhibited by psychological barriers. Receptive bilingualism is frequently encountered among adult immigrants to the U.S. who do not speak English as a native language but who have children who do speak English natively, usually in part because those children's education has been conducted in English; while the immigrant parents can understand both their native language and English, they speak only their native language to their children.  If their children are likewise receptively bilingual but productively English-monolingual, throughout the conversation the parents will speak their native language and the children will speak English. If their children are productively bilingual, however, those children may answer in the parents' native language, in English, or in a combination of both languages, varying their choice of language depending on factors such as the communication's content, context, and/or emotional intensity and the presence or absence of third-party speakers of one language or the other. The third alternative represents the phenomenon of "[[code-switching]]" in which the productively bilingual party to a communication switches languages in the course of that communication.  Receptively bilingual persons, especially children, may rapidly achieve oral fluency by spending extended time in situations where they are required to speak the language that they theretofore understood only passively.  Until both generations achieve oral fluency, not all definitions of bilingualism accurately characterize the family as a whole, but the linguistic differences between the family's generations often constitute little or no impairment to the family's functionality.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  Receptive bilingualism in one language as exhibited by a speaker of another language, or even as exhibited by most speakers of that language, is not the same as [[mutual intelligibility]] of languages; the latter is a property of a pair of ''languages'', namely a consequence of objectively high lexical and grammatical similarities between the languages themselves (''e.g.'', Iberian Spanish and Iberian Portuguese), whereas the former is a property of one or more ''persons'' and is determined by subjective or intersubjective factors such as the respective languages' prevalence in the life history (including family upbringing, educational setting, and ambient culture) of the person or persons.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa |title=Ethnologue report for language code: spa |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2010-07-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418134038/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa |archivedate=18 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Personality ===
Because it is difficult or impossible to master many of the high-level semantic aspects of a language (including but not limited to its [[idiom]]s and [[eponym]]s) without first understanding the culture and history of the region in which that language evolved, as a practical matter an in-depth familiarity with multiple cultures is a prerequisite for high-level multilingualism.  This knowledge of cultures individually and comparatively, or indeed the mere fact of one's having that knowledge, often forms an important part of both what one considers one's own personal identity to be and what others consider that identity to be.<ref name="auto" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Halwachs|first=D.W.|title=Polysystem repertoire and identity|journal=Grazer Linguistische Studien|year=1993|volume=39–40|pages=71–90}}</ref> Some studies have found that groups of multilingual individuals get higher average scores on tests for certain personality traits such as cultural [[empathy]], [[open-mindedness]] and social initiative.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dewaele|first=J.|title=Multilingualism, empathy, and multicompetence|journal=International Journal of Multilingualism|year=2012|pages=1–15|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/linguistics/our-staff/li-wei/copy_of_DewaeleLiWei2012.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009194907/http://www.bbk.ac.uk/linguistics/our-staff/li-wei/copy_of_DewaeleLiWei2012.pdf|archivedate=9 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dewaele|first=J.|title=The effect of multilingualism, sociobiographical, and situational factors on communicative anxiety and foreign language anxiety of mature language learners|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|year=2007|volume=11|pages=391–409|doi=10.1177/13670069070110040301|issue=4}}</ref> The idea of [[linguistic relativity]], which claims that the language people speak influences the way they see the world, can be interpreted to mean that individuals who speak multiple languages have a broader, more diverse view of the world, even when speaking only one language at a time.<ref name="Grosjean 2011">{{cite journal|last=Grosjean|first=F|title=Life as a bilingual: the reality of living with two or more languages|journal=Psychology Today|year=2011}}</ref>  Some bilinguals feel that their personality changes depending on which language they are speaking;<ref>{{cite book|last=Tokuhama-Espinosa|first=T.|title=The multilingual mind: Issues discussed by, for, and about people living with many languages|year=2003|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Connecticut}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wang|first=X.|title=Growing up with three languages: Birth to eleven|year=2008|publisher=Multilingualism Matters|location=Briston, United Kingdom}}</ref> thus multilingualism is said to create multiple personalities. Xiao-lei Wang states in her book ''Growing up with Three Languages: Birth to Eleven'': "Languages used by speakers with one or more than one language are used not just to represent a unitary self, but to enact different kinds of selves, and different linguistic contexts create different kinds of self-expression and experiences for the same person." However, there has been little rigorous research done on this topic and it is difficult to define "personality" in this context. [[François Grosjean]] wrote: "What is seen as a change in personality is most probably simply a shift in attitudes and behaviors that correspond to a shift in situation or context, independent of language."<ref>{{cite book | title=Living with two languages and two cultures, chapter in: Cultural and Language Diversity and the Deaf Experience. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=François Grosjean (author of chapter); Editor: I. Parasnis | year=1996}}</ref>  However, the [[Sapir-Whorf]] hypothesis, which states that a language shapes our vision of the world, may suggest that a language learned by a grown-up may have much fewer emotional [[connotation]]s and therefore allow a more serene discussion than a language learned by a child and to that respect more or less bound to a child's perception of the world. A 2013 study published in PLoS ONE found that rather than an emotion-based explanation, switching into the second language seems to exempt bilinguals from the social norms and constraints such as political correctness.<ref name="ParadowskiGawinkowskaBilewicz2013">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gawinkowska M, Paradowski MB, Bilewicz M |title=Second language as an exemptor from sociocultural norms.

==Learning language==
{{main|Language education}}
One view is that of the [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Noam Chomsky]] in what he calls the human [[language acquisition device]]—a mechanism which enables an individual to recreate correctly the rules and certain other characteristics of language used by speakers around the learner.<ref name="Santrock">Santrock, John W. (2008).  Bilingualism and Second-Language Learning.  ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4th ed.)'' (pp. 330–335).  New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.</ref>  This device, according to Chomsky, wears out over time, and is not normally available by [[puberty]], which he uses to explain the poor results some adolescents and adults have when learning aspects of a [[second language]] (L2).

If language learning is a [[Cognition|cognitive process]], rather than a language acquisition device, as the school led by [[Stephen Krashen]] suggests, there would only be relative, not categorical, differences between the two types of language learning.

[[Rod Ellis]] quotes research finding that the earlier children learn a second language, the better off they are, in terms of [[pronunciation]]. See the [[Critical period hypothesis]]. European schools generally offer secondary language classes for their students early on, due to the interconnectedness with neighbour countries with different languages. Most European students now study at least two foreign languages, a process strongly encouraged by the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/culture/eu-students-learn-foreign-languages-study/article-185818|title=EurActiv: Most EU students learn two foreign languages: Study, 28 September 2009, retrieved November 2011|author=|date=|website=euractiv.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015202853/http://www.euractiv.com/culture/eu-students-learn-foreign-languages-study/article-185818|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In [[second language]] class, students will commonly face the difficulties on thinking in the target language because they are influenced by their native language and culture patterns. Robert B. Kaplan thinks that in second language classes, the foreign-student paper is out of focus because the foreign student is employing rhetoric and a sequence of thought which violate the expectations of the native reader.<ref name="Kaplan">Kaplan, Robert B. "Cultural thought patterns in inter-cultural education language learning". 16.1-2(2006). 1-20. Wiley Online Library. Web. 9 November 2010.</ref> Foreign students who have mastered syntactic structures have still demonstrated inability to compose adequate themes, term papers, theses, and dissertations. Robert B. Kaplan describes two key words that affect people when they learn a second language. [[Logic]] in the popular, rather than the logician's sense of the word, which is the basis of rhetoric, is evolved out of a culture; it is not universal. [[Rhetoric]], then, is not universal either, but varies, from culture to culture and even from time to time within a given culture.<ref name="Kaplan" /> Language teachers know how to predict the differences between pronunciations or constructions in different languages, but they might be less clear about the differences between rhetoric, that is, in the way they use language to accomplish various purposes, particularly in writing.<ref name="Gadda">Gadda, George.

A study in 2012 has shown that using a foreign language reduces decision-making biases. It was surmised that the [[Framing effect (psychology)|framing effect]] disappeared when choices are presented in a foreign tongue. As human reasoning is shaped by two distinct modes of thought: one that is systematic, analytical and cognition-intensive, and another that is fast, unconscious and emotionally charged, it was believed that a second language provides a useful cognitive distance from automatic processes, promoting analytical thought and reducing unthinking, emotional reaction. Therefore, those who speak two languages have better critical thinking and decision making skills.<ref>{{cite journal

Widespread multilingualism is one form of [[language contact]]. Multilingualism was common in the past: in early times, when most people were members of small language communities, it was necessary to know two or more languages for trade or any other dealings outside one's own town or village, and this holds good today in places of high linguistic diversity such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[India]]. Linguist Ekkehard Wolff estimates that 50% of the population of Africa is multilingual.<ref>Wolff, Ekkehard (2000).  Language and Society. In: Bernd Heine and Derek Nurse (Eds.) ''African Languages - An Introduction'', 317. Cambridge University Press.
</ref>

In multilingual societies, not all speakers need to be multilingual. Some states can have multilingual policies and recognize several official languages, such as Canada (English and French). In some states, particular languages may be associated with particular regions in the state (e.g., Canada) or with particular ethnicities (e.g., Malaysia and Singapore). When all speakers are multilingual, linguists classify the community according to the functional distribution of the languages involved:
* '''[[Diglossia]]''': if there is a structural functional distribution of the languages involved, the society is termed 'diglossic'. Typical diglossic areas are those areas in [[Europe]] where a [[regional language]] is used in informal, usually oral, contexts, while the state language is used in more formal situations. [[Frisia]] (with [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and [[German language|German]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and [[Lusatia]] (with [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] and German) are well-known examples. Some writers limit diglossia to situations where the languages are closely related, and could be considered dialects of each other.  This can also be observed in Scotland where, in formal situations, [[English language|English]] is used. However, in informal situations in many areas, [[Scots language|Scots]] is the preferred language of choice. A similar phenomenon is also observed in Arabic-speaking regions. The effects of diglossia could be seen in the difference between written Arabic ([[Modern Standard Arabic]]) and colloquial Arabic. However, as time goes, the Arabic language somewhere between the two have been created what some have deemed "Middle Arabic" or "Common Arabic". Because of this diversification of the language, the concept of spectroglossia<ref>M.HBakalla(1984), Arabic Culture through its Language and Literature, Kegan Paul International, London</ref> has been suggested.
* '''Ambilingualism''': a region is called ambilingual if this functional distribution is not observed. In a typical ambilingual area it is nearly impossible to predict which language will be used in a given setting. True ambilingualism is rare. Ambilingual tendencies can be found in small states with multiple heritages like [[Luxembourg]], which has a combined Franco-Germanic heritage, or [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], which fuses the cultures of [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], [[China]], and [[India]] or communities with high rates of deafness like [[Martha's Vineyard]] where historically most inhabitants spoke both [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|MVSL]] and [[English language|English]] or in southern Israel where locals speak both [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and either Arabic or Hebrew. Ambilingualism also can manifest in specific regions of larger states that have both a clearly dominant state language (be it ''de jure'' or ''de facto'') and a protected minority language that is limited in terms of distribution of speakers within the country. This tendency is especially pronounced when, even though the local language is widely spoken, there is a reasonable assumption that all citizens speak the predominant state tongue (e.g., English in Quebec vs. Canada; Spanish in Catalonia vs. Spain). This phenomenon can also occur in border regions with many cross-border contacts.
* '''Bipart-lingualism''': if more than one language can be heard in a small area, but the large majority of speakers are monolinguals, who have little contact with speakers from neighbouring ethnic groups, an area is called 'bipart-lingual'. An example of this is the [[Balkans]].

N.B. the terms given above all refer to situations describing only two languages. In cases of an unspecified number of languages, the terms '''polyglossia''', '''omnilingualism''', and '''multipart-lingualism''' are more appropriate.

==Multilingualism between different language speakers==
Whenever two people meet, negotiations take place. If they want to express solidarity and sympathy, they tend to seek common features in their behavior. If speakers wish to express distance towards or even dislike of the person they are speaking to, the reverse is true, and differences are sought. This mechanism also extends to language, as described in the [[Communication Accommodation Theory]].

Some multilinguals use [[code-switching]], a term that describes the process of 'swapping' between languages. In many cases, code-switching is motivated by the wish to express loyalty to more than one cultural group,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} as holds for many immigrant communities in the New World. Code-switching may also function as a strategy where proficiency is lacking. Such strategies are common if the vocabulary of one of the languages is not very elaborated for certain fields, or if the speakers have not developed proficiency in certain lexical domains, as in the case of immigrant languages.

This code-switching appears in many forms. If a speaker has a positive attitude towards both languages and towards code-switching, many switches can be found, even within the same sentence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Poplack Shana | authorlink = Shana Poplack | year = 1980 | title = Sometimes I'll start a sentence in Spanish y termino en español": toward a typology of code-switching | url = | journal = Linguistics | volume = 18 | issue = 7/8| pages = 581–618 | doi = 10.1515/ling.1980.18.7-8.581 }}</ref> If, however, the speaker is reluctant to use code-switching, as in the case of a lack of proficiency, he might knowingly or unknowingly try to camouflage his attempt by converting elements of one language into elements of the other language through [[calque|calquing]]. This results in speakers using words like ''courrier noir'' (literally mail that is black) in French, instead of the proper word for [[blackmail]], ''chantage''.

Sometimes a [[pidgin language]] may develop. A pidgin language is a fusion of two languages that is mutually understandable for both speakers. Some pidgin languages develop into real languages (such as [[Papiamento]] in [[Curaçao]] or [[Singlish]] in [[Singapore]]) while others remain as slangs or jargons (such as [[Helsinki slang]], which is more or less [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] both in Finnish and Swedish).{{Clarify|date=July 2014}} In other cases, prolonged influence of languages on each other may have the effect of changing one or both to the point where it may be considered that a new language is born. For example, many linguists believe that the [[Occitan language]] and the [[Catalan language]] were formed because a population speaking a single Occitano-Romance language was divided into political spheres of influence of France and Spain, respectively. [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] is a complex blend of [[Middle High German]] with [[Hebrew]] and borrowings from Slavic languages.

Bilingual interaction can even take place without the speakers switching. In certain areas, it is not uncommon for speakers each to use a different language within the same conversation. This phenomenon is found, amongst other places, in [[Scandinavia]]. Most speakers of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] can communicate with each other speaking their respective languages, while few can speak both (people used to these situations often adjust their language, avoiding words that are not found in the other language or that can be misunderstood). Using different languages is usually called [[non-convergent discourse]], a term introduced by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] linguist Reitze Jonkman.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} To a certain extent, this situation also exists between [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], although everyday contact is fairly rare because of the distance between the two respective communities. Another example is the former state of [[Czechoslovakia]], where two closely related and mutually intelligible languages ([[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]) were in common use. Most Czechs and Slovaks understand both languages, although they would use only one of them (their respective mother tongue) when speaking. For example, in Czechoslovakia it was common to hear two people talking on television each speaking a different language without any difficulty understanding each other. This bilinguality still exists nowadays, although it has started to deteriorate after Czechoslovakia split up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Multilingualism at the linguistic level==

===Models for native language literacy programs===
Sociopolitical as well as socio-cultural identity arguments may influence native language literacy.  While these two camps may occupy much of the debate about which languages children will learn to read, a greater emphasis on the linguistic aspects of the argument is appropriate. In spite of the political turmoil precipitated by this debate, researchers continue to espouse a linguistic basis for it.  This rationale is based upon the work of Jim Cummins (1983).<!--- this paragraph is not intelligible --->

===Sequential model===
{{Main|Sequential bilingualism}}
In this model, learners receive literacy instruction in their native language until they acquire a "threshold" literacy proficiency. Some researchers use age 3 as the age when a child has basic communicative competence in their first language (Kessler, 1984).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hanen.org/web/Home/AboutHanen/NewsViews/OneLanguageorTwo/tabid/220/Default.aspx|title=Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=www.hanen.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530230334/http://www.hanen.org/web/Home/AboutHanen/NewsViews/OneLanguageorTwo/tabid/220/Default.aspx|archivedate=30 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Children may go through a process of sequential acquisition if they migrate at a young age to a country where a different language is spoken, or if the child exclusively speaks his or her heritage language at home until he/she is immersed in a school setting where instruction is offered in a different language.

The phases children go through during sequential acquisition are less linear than for simultaneous acquisition and can vary greatly among children. Sequential acquisition is a more complex and lengthier process, although there is no indication that non-language-delayed children end up less proficient than simultaneous bilinguals, so long as they receive adequate input in both languages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Bilingual model===
{{Main|Simultaneous bilingualism}}
In this model, the native language and the community language are simultaneously taught. The advantage is literacy in two languages as the outcome. However, the teacher must be well-versed in both languages and also in techniques for teaching a second language.

===Coordinate model===
This model posits that equal time should be spent in separate instruction of the native language and of the community language. The native language class, however, focuses on basic literacy while the community language class focuses on listening and speaking skills. Being a bilingual does not necessarily mean that one can speak, for example, English and French.

===Outcomes===
{{Citation style|section|date=June 2018}}
Cummins' research concluded that the development of competence in the native language serves as a foundation of proficiency that can be transposed to the second language — the common underlying proficiency hypothesis.  His work sought to overcome the perception propagated in the 1960s that learning two languages made for two competing aims. The belief was that the two languages were mutually exclusive and that learning a second required unlearning elements and dynamics of the first in order to accommodate the second (Hakuta, 1990). The evidence for this perspective relied on the fact that some errors in acquiring the second language were related to the rules of the first language (Hakuta, 1990). How this hypothesis holds under different types of languages such as Romance versus non-Western languages has yet to undergo research.

Another new development that has influenced the linguistic argument for bilingual literacy is the length of time necessary to acquire the second language.  While previously children were believed to have the ability to learn a language within a year, today researchers believe that within and across academic settings, the time span is nearer to five years (Collier, 1992; Ramirez, 1992).

An interesting outcome of studies during the early 1990s however confirmed that students who do successfully complete bilingual instruction perform better academically (Collier, 1992; Ramirez, 1992).  These students exhibit more cognitive elasticity including a better ability to analyse abstract visual patterns.  Students who receive bidirectional bilingual instruction where equal proficiency in both languages is required perform at an even higher level.  Examples of such programs include international and multi-national education schools.

==Multilingualism in computing==
[[File:Hebkeyboard.JPG|thumb|Dual language [[Hebrew]] and English keyboard]]

With emerging markets and expanding international cooperation, business users expect to be able to use software and applications in their own language.<ref>Dedić, N. and Stanier C., 2016., "An Evaluation of the Challenges of Multilingualism in Data Warehouse Development" in 18th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems - ICEIS 2016, p. 196.</ref> Multilingualisation (or "m17n", where "17" stands for 17 omitted letters) of computer systems can be considered part of a continuum between [[internationalization and localization]]:
* A localized system has been adapted or converted for a particular locale (other than the one it was originally developed for), including the language of the user interface, input, and display, and features such as time/date display and currency; but each instance of the system only supports a single locale.
* Multilingualised software supports multiple languages for display and input simultaneously, but generally has a single user interface language.  Support for other locale features like time, date, number and currency formats may vary as the system tends towards full internationalisation.  Generally a multilingualised system is intended for use in a specific locale, whilst allowing for multilingual content.
* An internationalised system is equipped for use in a range of locales, allowing for the co-existence of several languages and character sets in user interfaces and displays.  In particular, a system may not be considered internationalised in the fullest sense unless the interface language is selectable by the user at runtime.

Translating the user interface is usually part of the [[software localization]] process, which also includes adaptations such as units and date conversion. Many software applications are available in several languages, ranging from a handful (the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken languages]]) to dozens for the most popular applications (such as [[office suite]]s, [[web browser]]s, etc.).  Due to the status of [[English in computing]], software development nearly always uses it (but see also [[Non-English-based programming languages]]), so almost all commercial software is initially available in an English version, and multilingual versions, if any, may be produced as alternative options based on the English original.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wolfram.com/language/11/multilingual-functionality/?product=mathematica|title=Multilingual Functionality: New in Wolfram Language 11|website=www.wolfram.com|access-date=2016-08-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820020128/http://www.wolfram.com/language/11/multilingual-functionality/?product=mathematica|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Multilingualism in the workplace==

Globalization has led the world to be more deeply interconnected. Consequences of this are that more and more companies are trading with foreign countries, and with countries that don't necessarily speak the same language. English has become an important working knowledge mainly in multinational companies, but also in smaller companies. NGO workers are also faced with multilingualism when intervening on the field and use both linguistic and non-verbal strategies to communicate.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bencherki|first1=Nicolas|last2=Matte|first2=Frédérik|last3=Pelletier|first3=Émilie|title=

=== Multilingualism in English speaking countries ===
According to Hewitt (2008) entrepreneurs in London from Poland, China or Turkey use English mainly for communication with customers, suppliers and banks, but their own native languages for work tasks and social purposes.
Even in English speaking countries immigrants are still able to use their own mother tongue in the workplace thanks to other immigrants from the same place. Kovacs (2004)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kovacs|first1=M.|title=Australian Finns on the verge of language shift|date=2004|pages=108, 200–223}}</ref> describes this phenomenon in Australia with Finnish immigrants in the construction industry who spoke Finnish during working hours.
But even though foreign languages may be used in the workplace, English is still a must-know working skill. Mainstream society justifies the divided job market, arguing that getting a low-paying job is the best newcomers can achieve considering their limited language skills.

=== Multilingualism in Asia===
With companies going international they are now focusing more and more on the English level of their employees. Especially in South Korea since the 1990s, companies are using different English language testing to evaluate job applicants, and the criteria in those tests are constantly upgrading the level for good English. In India it is even possible to receive training to acquire an English accent, as the number of outsourced call centres in India has soared in the past decades.
Meanwhile, Japan ranks 26th out of 63 countries in a 2014 English Proficiency Index, amid calls for this to improve in time for the [[2020 Tokyo Olympics]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Within multiracial countries such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], it is not unusual for one to speak two or more languages, albeit with varying degrees of fluency.<ref>{{cite news|title=9 of the world's most multilingual countries|url=http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/9-of-the-worlds-most-multilingual-countries|publisher=Mother Nature Network|date=28 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005210034/http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/9-of-the-worlds-most-multilingual-countries|archivedate=5 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=

=== Multilingualism in Africa===
Not only in multinational companies is English an important skill, but also in the engineering industry, in the chemical, electrical and aeronautical fields. A study directed by Hill and van Zyl (2002) shows that in South Africa young black engineers used English most often for communication and documentation. However, Afrikaans and other local languages were also used to explain particular concepts to workers in order to ensure understanding and cooperation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gunnarson|first1=Britt-Louise|title=Multilingualism in the Workplace|journal=Annual Review of Applied Linguistics|date=2013|volume=33|pages=162–&volumeId=33&issueId=-1&aid=9090498}}</ref>

=== Multilingualism in Europe ===
In Europe, as the domestic market is generally quite restricted, international trade is a norm. But there is no predominant language in Europe (with [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German]] spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Belgium; [[List of territorial entities where French is an official language|French]] in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland; and [[List of territorial entities where English is an official language|English]] in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Malta). Most of the time, English is used as a communication language, but in multilingual countries such as Belgium (Dutch, French and German), Switzerland (German, French, Italian and Romanche), Luxembourg (Luxembourgish, French and German) or Spain (Spanish, Catalan, Basque and Galician), it is common to see employees mastering two or even three of those languages. Some languages such as Danish, Swedish and Norwegian or Croatian, Slovenian, Serbian and Bosnian are so close to each other that it is generally more common for meeting to use their mother tongue rather than English.

Continued global [[diversity (business)|diversity]] has led to an increasingly multilingual workforce. Europe has become an excellent model to observe this newly diversified labor culture. The expansion of the European Union with its open labor market has provided opportunities both for well-trained professionals and unskilled workers to move to new countries to seek employment. Political changes and turmoil have also led to migration and to the creation of new and more complex multilingual workplaces. In most wealthy and secure countries, immigrants are found mostly in low paid jobs but also, increasingly, in high status positions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gunnarsson|first1=Britt-Louise|title=Multilingualism in European Workplaces.|date=2014|volume=33|pages=11–33|doi=10.1515/multi-2014-0002|journal=Multilingua}}</ref>

If a song is not written in a common tongue, then it is usually written in whatever is the predominant language in the musician's country of origin, or in another widely recognized language, such as English, German, Spanish, or French.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The bilingual song cycles "there..." and "Sing, Poetry" on the 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] consist of musical settings of Russian poems with their English self-translations by [[Joseph Brodsky]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]], respectively.<ref>[https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B005USB24A "Troika: Russia's westerly poetry in three orchestral song cycles"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20171103083529/https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B005USB24A |date=3 November 2017 }}, Rideau Rouge Records, ASIN: B005USB24A, 2011.</ref>
