'''Caló''' (also known as '''Pachuco''') is an [[argot]] or slang of [[Mexican Spanish]] that originated during the first half of the 20th century in the [[Southwestern United States]]. It is the product of [[zoot suit|zoot-suit]] [[pachuco]] culture that developed in the 1930s and '40s in cities along the US/Mexico border.

==Origin==
According to Chicano artist and writer [[José Antonio Burciaga]]:

{{quote|Caló originally defined the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Romani people|gypsy]] dialect. But Chicano Caló is the combination of a few basic influences: Hispanicized [[English language|English]]; Anglicized [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; and the use of archaic 15th-century Spanish words such as ''truje'' for ''traje'' (brought, past tense of verb 'to bring'), or ''haiga'', for ''haya'' (from ''haber'', to have). These words were left in isolated pockets of Northern New Mexico and the Southwest, especially [[New Mexico]], by ''conquistadores españoles''.}}

He goes on to describe the speech of his father, a native of [[El Paso]], [[Texas]]:

{{quote|My father had a vocabulary of Spanish words that to this day are not found in popular Spanish language dictionaries. He was born into a poor, migrant farm working family in a community of people that still used ancient words that some found improper and backwards but are to be found in [[Miguel de Cervantes|Miguel Cervantez]]'s <!--Look, I know Cervantes' name is spelled incorrectly. The error is acknowledged with the word "sic" in editorial brackets. It is a quote from a text, and any change to that quote makes it a misquote. So don't change it! I am sick of having to change it back!-->[sic] classic ''[[Don Quixote]]''. My father commonly used words such as minjurne for mixture, or cachibaches (also used in Cuban Spanish) for junk. I would hear them without knowing their definition but I knew exactly what he meant when talking within a specific context. Some words were archaic, others were a combination of English and Spanish. And though he knew "standard" Spanish of "educated" people, he also worked, lived, laughed and cried with words that were more expressive and indigenous to the border than standard Spanish.}}

The Caló of El Paso was probably influenced by the wordplay common to the speech of residents of the [[Tepito]] [[barrio]] of [[Mexico City]]. One such resident was the comic film actor [[Germán Valdés]], a native of Mexico City who grew up in [[Ciudad Juárez]] (just across the [[US-Mexico border]] from El Paso).  His films did much to popularize the language in Mexico and the United States.

==Development==
Caló has evolved in every decade since the 1940-1950s. It underwent much change during the [[Chicano Movement]] of the 1960s as Chicanos began to enter US universities and become exposed to counterculture and psychedelia. Caló words and expressions became cultural symbols of the Chicano Movement during the 1960s and 1970s, when they were used frequently in literature and poetry. That language was sometimes known as Floricanto. Caló enjoyed mainstream exposure when the character "Cheech", played by [[Cheech Marin]], used Caló in the [[Cheech and Chong]] movies of the 1970s.

By the 1970s, the term Pachuco was frequently shortened to Chuco The Pachuco originated from El Paso, which was the root of the city's nickname, "Chuco Town". Pachucos usually dressed in zoot suits with wallet chains, round hats with feathers and were Chicanos.

Caló is not to be confused with [[Spanglish]], which is not limited to Mexican Spanish. It is similar to [[Lunfardo]] in that it has an eclectic and multilingual vocabulary.

== Features ==
Caló, like Spanglish, makes heavy use of [[code-switching]]. Unlike Spanglish, Caló uses [[rhyming]] and, in some cases, a type of rhyming slang similar in Spanish to [[Cockney rhyming slang]] or [[African American Vernacular English]] jive.

==Examples==
Since Caló is primarily spoken by individuals with varying formal knowledge of Spanish or English, variations occur in words, especially of [[phoneme]]s pronounced similarly in Spanish: ''c''/''s'', ''w''/''hu''/''gu'', ’'r''/''d'', and ''b''/''v''. It is common to see the word "barrio" (neighborhood) spelled as "varrio", "vato" (dude) spelled as "bato" or "güero" (blond/white man) spelled as "huero" or even "weddo".

==Usage==
The translations should not be taken literally; they are idioms like the English "See you later alligator".

;''¿Qué Pasiones?'' : (literally "What Passions") ''¿Qué Pasa?'' meaning "What is going on?"
;''¿Si ya sábanas, paquetes hilo?'' or ''Si ya Sabanas, pa' que cobijas'' : (literally, "If already sheets, packages thread?/covers what for") ''¿Si ya sabes, pa(ra) qué te digo?'' meaning, "If you already know, why am I telling you?"

Occasionally, English is spoken with Mexican features. Speaking to a sibling or family member about parents, for example, a Caló speaker will refer to them as "My Mother" (''Mi Mamá'') instead of "Mom" or "Our mother".

Rhyming is sometimes used by itself and for emphasis.

Common phrases include: 
;''¿Me comprendes, Méndez?'' : "Do you understand, Méndez?"
;''¿O te explico, Federico?'' : "Or do I explain it to you, Federico?"
;''Nel, pastel'' : "No way" (lit. "Nay, Cake")
;''Al rato, vato'' : "Later, dude" (lit. "al rato" means "later"; "vato" means friend or guy)
;''Me esperas, a comer peras?'' : "Will you wait for me?" (lit. "will you wait for me to eat pears?")
;''¿Qué te pasa, calabaza?'' : "Whats going on?"  (lit. "What is happening to you, squash/pumpkin?")
;''Nada Nada, Limonada'' : "Not much" (lit. "Nothing, nothing, lemonade".  Spoken as a response to the above, "¿Qué te pasa, calabaza?").
