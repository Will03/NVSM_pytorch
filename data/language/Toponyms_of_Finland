The '''[[toponym]]s of Finland''' result mainly from the legacy left by three linguistic heritages: the [[Finnish language]] (spoken as first language by about 93% of the population), the [[Finland Swedish|Swedish language]] (about 5.5%) and [[Sami languages]] (about 0.03%). Finland’s place names range from those of unknown or unrecognizable origins to more clearly derivable [[onomastics]]. There are both national and international recommendations on how to use the bilingual country's place names in texts written in different languages. In Finland, the [[Research Institute for the Languages of Finland]] and the [[National Land Survey of Finland]] are jointly responsible for the standardization of place names.

==Historical aspects==
A few notable place names – such as a few major hydronyms [[Päijänne]], [[Saimaa]], [[Imatra]] and [[Keitele]] which are thought to be among the oldest toponyms – still lack a sound derivation from existing languages despite of different approaches.{{clarify|date=August 2010}} This has led to the postulation that they may originate from an unknown language.<ref>[http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=1150 Article in Finnish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031539/http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=1150 |date=2007-09-30 }}</ref>
A substratum of archaic Sami place names, often fennicized in the course of time, can be found throughout the country.<ref>[http://www.kotus.fi/files/576/toponymic_guidelines.pdf  page 9]</ref> The majority of Finland’s toponyms can be recognized having archaic or dialectal Finnish origins. A Finnish substratum can be deduced in Swedish place names and vice versa in many cases. Major urbanisation started and city rights were granted in Finland when the country was part of Sweden in a situation where Swedish was the de facto only official language though the majority always spoke Finnish dialects as a first language. Therefore, in older foreign writing, many municipal and city names are given only in their Swedish form. Other substrata in Finland’s toponyms include Finnic, Baltic, Germanic and Slavic linguistic influence in several chronological layers.

==Jurisdiction regarding languages in Finland==
Finland, except for the [[Åland islands]], has two official languages: Finnish and Swedish. The Åland islands have a single official language: Swedish. On the mainland, Swedish-speakers are concentrated to the regions [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]], [[Uusimaa]] and around [[Turku]]. [[North Sami]], [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] and [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]] are semi-official in the [[Sami Domicile Area]]. The Language Act of 2003 groups municipalities into three groups: monolingually Finnish, monolingually Swedish and bilingual. The municipality is monolingual, if it has less than 8% of the minority language speakers and if the population of the lingual minority in the municipality is below 3,000. Other communities are bilingual.<ref name="Kielilaki 423/2003">[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2003/20030423 Kielilaki (423/2003)] 5 §. Retrieved 3-8-2007. {{fi}}</ref>

In bilingual municipalities, the Language Act requires that all toponyms have both a Finnish and a Swedish name.<ref name="Kielilaki 423/2003"/> In addition, many monolingually Finnish municipalities have an official Swedish name, and vice versa. The municipalities have the power to decide their own name but they are required to consult with the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland before the official decision.<ref>[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1995/19950365 Kuntalaki (365/1995)] 5 §. Retrieved 3-8-2007. {{fi}}</ref>

==Conventions==
These are the current conventions recommended by the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland. The conventions have also been adopted by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names:<ref>TOPONYMIC GUIDELINES FOR MAP EDITORS AND OTHER EDITORS, FINLAND, (v. 4.2, 28 February 2006) [http://www.kotus.fi/files/576/toponymic_guidelines.pdf]</ref>

*Finnish place names are used in the [[Finnic languages]] (such as Finnish and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]). Swedish place names are used in the [[North Germanic languages]] (such as [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]). Sami place names are used in the different Sami languages around northern Fennoscandia.
*In other languages, if that language doesn’t already have an established toponym for the place (very seldom), the choice between Finnish and Swedish toponyms is based on the demographic situation. Finnish place names are used when handling a municipality where Finnish is the majority language (90% of all municipalities,<ref>389 out of 431</ref> 93% of the cities<ref>106 out of 114</ref>). Swedish place naming is used when handling a municipality where Swedish is the majority language. Concerning the Sami Homeland, toponyms are written in Finnish and appended with the Sami place names.

The convention concerning street names and traffic signs maintains that the majority language toponym is presented topmost and place names in the minority languages are listed below.

===Possible deviations in the conventions===
A few exonyms (in [[Medieval Latin|Medieval]] or [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]], not in use in Finland or Sweden) exist for Finland’s provincial structures. These include the names of the nine historical provinces (Fi: maakunta, Sw: landskap) that have given names to some of Finland’s current regions (Fi: maakunta, Sw: landskap, altogether 20 as of 1997). These may fall under the category of "already established place names in foreign languages" mentioned in the above recommendations.

The names of the nine historical provinces in Finnish, Swedish and English :

:1. Varsinais-Suomi fi; Egentliga Finland sv; [[Finland Proper]] en 
:2. [[Uusimaa]] fi, en; Nyland sv 
:3. [[Satakunta]] fi, sv, en 
:4. Häme fi; Tavastland sv; [[Tavastia Proper|Tavastia]] en 
:5. [[Savonia (historical province)|Savo]] fi, en; Savolax sv 
:6. Karjala fi; Karelen sv; [[Karelia]] en 
:7. Pohjanmaa fi; Österbotten sv; [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] en 
:8. Lappi fi; Lappland sv; [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] en 
:9. Åland sv, en; Ahvenanmaa fi

===Guidelines for naming new places===
In urban planning, new names are needed for different places. Suburbs, streets, parks and other areas must be named. In bilingual municipalities, the task is complicated by the need to use two different languages in the toponyms. As all municipalities in the Finnish capital region, which is the most swiftly developing area in Finland, are bilingual, the problem of devising good toponyms is not a small task.

The [[Research Institute for the Languages of Finland]] has given guidelines for devising new toponyms. The basic principle is to use toponyms already in use and spell them according to the modern language norms. As the old toponym for a minor place, such as a field, often exist only in one language, they should be translated with care. Only such names which carry an identifiable meaning should be translated directly. If the toponym already exists in both languages, the existing forms should be used. If the translation of the name is unfeasible and there exists no toponym in the other language, then the toponym should be loaned in its original form. Personal names should not be translated. However, if the existing name is unusable in the other language for phonetic or grammatical reasons, a new name may be freely invented.<ref>[http://www.kotus.fi/ohjeet/suomen_kielen_lautakunnan_suosituksia/suositukset/ohjeet_kaksikielisen_alueen_kaava-_ja_haja-asutusalueiden_nimien_antamiseen Nimistönsuunnittelu i.e. plan for naming]. Retrieved 2015 {{fi}}</ref>

The cases where two municipalities are fused together, create a special case for the construction of toponyms. There are two simple cases for the name selection:
*smaller municipalities joining a city: the name of the city should be used
*municipalities which have been chapel parishes joining the municipality which has been the mother parish: the name of the historical mother parish should be used.<ref name="kotus.fi">[http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=509 Kotimaisten kielten tutkimuskeskus. Yhdistyvien kuntien nimet.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013237/http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=509 |date=2007-09-30 }} 7-12-2006. Retrieved 3-8-2007</ref>

In other cases, the toponym should be selected from the historical toponyms of the area. In many cases, there are historical administrative structures that have encompassed the area of the merging municipalities. If such names are unusable, the name of some the most prominent villages in the area should be used. To reduce the possibility of confusion, the new name should not include the name of the province or the region. In no case should the name be made up of two parts, because the use of such name is grammatically difficult in Finnish language. The names of the merger projects or frivolous names should also be avoided at all costs.<ref name="kotus.fi"/>

If the merging municipalities will form a bilingual municipality, the Finnish name chosen for the municipality should be such that a Swedish counterpart can be found without difficulty. The Swedish name of the new municipality should be devised according to the same principles as in other toponymical planning.<ref name="kotus.fi"/>

===Finnish Grammar===

In [[Finnish grammar]], some toponyms receive external locative suffixes, especially those named for bodies of water, as in (river and town Seinäjoki) ''Seinäjoe'''lla''''' (either on river Seinäjoki or in town Seinäjoki. Case of being in or under the river being ''Seinäjoe'''ssa'''''). The rest receive internal locative suffixes, as in ''Helsingi'''ssä''''' (being inflected form of the town, meaning: in Helsinki).<ref>[http://www.kotus.fi/julkaisut/nimijulkaisut/paikannimijulkaisut/kuntien_nimet_ja_niiden_taivutus Examples of inflections of location names in Finnish and in Swedish (noted as "ruots.") where applicable]{{fi}}</ref><!--Can anyone provide a complete list?-- 

--(TL;DR=not going to happen, never for everywhere... I tried searching, that last <ref> there are too many different inflections.) Anyhow long story long:

Hi, I do not think it is applicable, there is 
-more than 180.000 lakes size larger than 500m2, locations&names of those and towns/villages near them inflected, same
-goes for rivers, islands, capes etc. (and ofc locations nearby) as most of them inflect differently,
-some rules (Joroinen->Joroisissa) are beyond me (I am almost sure it has something to do with those vocals being there, we cannot pronounce it without a more or less special case in naming)
-also there is the naming convention(I changed a dead link in reference to point to new instructions on naming(anything))
-AND on top of it all there is ongoing major reshaping&combining&namechanging of municipalities etc starting at the moment (12/2015-) (this is not the one older renaming & reshaping that is discussed in another location in-text)
-also, a new/not liked name can be freely shaped/changed considering local custom, ancient names etc instructions which are given in another link up there, Nimistönsuunnittelu (I updated, Finnish), after suggested&inspected&tc can be voted on change

But it is simple after you speak just few words in the language, see [[KOTUS]] (KOTUS is both required by law and is really needed) and then see some locations in http://www.kotus.fi/julkaisut/nimijulkaisut/paikannimijulkaisut/kuntien_nimet_ja_niiden_taivutus - it includes Swedish language names where applicable, i.e. where 8% or more speak (first language) Swedish/Finnish or locals want(in very many cases)...). Swedish were in parentheses I seem to recall.

Also even some major town names are going to change now when they join with nearby counties (when it happens, "soon"). OFC mail comes via direct name of the location so inflections not needed there either.

Also, why add more references to KOTUS pages, everyone who understands Finnish/Swedish knows these inflections OR can search KOTUS's site. Foreigners can inflect the few names they need/use or just speak English (mostly understood well). Or use non-inflected versions, we understand, trust me.

Feel free to remove my extra ramblings as required, Suchros -->
