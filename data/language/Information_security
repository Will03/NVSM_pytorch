{{Computer security}}
'''Information security''', sometimes shortened to '''InfoSec''', is the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of [[information]]. The information or data may take any form, e.g. electronic or physical.<ref name=":0">{{usc|44|3542}}(b)(1)</ref> Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.<ref name="AndressTheBasics14">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9NI0AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 |title=The Basics of Information Security: Understanding the Fundamentals of InfoSec in Theory and Practice |author=Andress, J. |publisher=Syngress |pages=240 |year=2014 |isbn=9780128008126}}</ref> This is largely achieved through a multi-step risk management process that identifies assets, threat sources, vulnerabilities, potential impacts, and possible controls, followed by assessment of the effectiveness of the risk management plan.

To standardize this discipline, academics and professionals collaborate and seek to set basic guidance, policies, and industry standards on [[password]], [[antivirus software]], [[firewall (computing)|firewall]], [[encryption software]], legal liability and user/administrator training standards.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-information-security.htm|title=What is Information Security? (with pictures)|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref> This standardization may be further driven by a wide variety of laws and regulations that affect how data is accessed, processed, stored, and transferred. However, the implementation of any standards and guidance within an entity may have limited effect if a culture of [[continual improvement process|continual improvement]] isn't adopted.<ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003">{{cite journal|last1=Schlienger|first1=Thomas|last2=Teufel|first2=Stephanie|date=December 2003|year=2003|title=Information security culture - from analysis to change|url=https://hdl.handle.net/10520/EJC27949|journal=South African Computer Society (SAICSIT)|volume=2003|issue=31|pages=46–52|via=}}</ref>

== Overview ==
At the core of information security is information assurance, the act of maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) of information, ensuring that [[information]] is not compromised in any way when critical issues arise.<ref name="SamonasTheCIA14">{{cite journal |title=The CIA Strikes Back: Redefining Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability in Security |journal=Journal of Information System Security |author1=Samonas, S.|author2=Coss, D. |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=21–45 |year=2014 |url=http://www.jissec.org/Contents/V10/N3/V10N3-Samonas.html}}</ref> These issues include but are not limited to natural disasters, computer/server malfunction, and physical theft. While paper-based business operations are still prevalent, requiring their own set of information security practices, enterprise digital initiatives are increasingly being emphasized,<ref name="GartnerSays17">{{cite web |url=https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3810771 |title=Gartner Says Digital Disruptors Are Impacting All Industries; Digital KPIs Are Crucial to Measuring Success |publisher=Gartner |date=2 October 2017 |accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref><ref name="GartnerSurvey17">{{cite web |url=https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3689017 |title=Gartner Survey Shows 42 Percent of CEOs Have Begun Digital Business Transformation |publisher=Gartner |date=24 April 2017 |accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref> with information assurance now typically being dealt with by information technology (IT) security specialists. These specialists apply information security to technology (most often some form of computer system). It is worthwhile to note that a [[computer]] does not necessarily mean a home desktop. A computer is any device with a [[Central processing unit|processor]] and some memory. Such devices can range from non-networked standalone devices as simple as calculators, to networked mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise/establishment due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses. They are responsible for keeping all of the [[technology]] within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to acquire critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.

The field of information security has grown and evolved significantly in recent years. It offers many areas for specialization, including securing networks and allied [[infrastructure]], securing [[Application software|applications]] and [[database]]s, [[security testing]], information systems [[Information technology audit|auditing]], [[business continuity planning]], electronic record discovery, and [[digital forensics]]. Information security professionals are very stable in their employment. {{As of|2013}} more than 80 percent of professionals had no change in employer or employment over a period of a year, and the number of professionals is projected to continuously grow more than 11 percent annually from 2014 to 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Information Security Qualifications Fact Sheet|url=http://www.itgovernance.co.uk/download/Information-security-qualifications.pdf|website=IT Governance|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>

=== Threats ===

Information security threats come in many different forms. Some of the most common threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, identity theft, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Most people have experienced software attacks of some sort. [[Computer virus|Viruses]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=CISSP Study Guide|last=Stewart|first=James|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-1-118-31417-3|location=Canada|pages=255–257}}</ref> [[Computer worm|worms]], [[Phishing|phishing attacks]], and [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]] are a few common examples of software attacks. The [[Intellectual property infringement|theft of intellectual property]] has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the IT field. [[Identity theft]] is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information. Theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today due to the fact that most devices today are mobile,<ref>{{cite web|last=Enge|first=Eric|url=https://www.stonetemple.com/mobile-vs-desktop-usage-mobile-grows-but-desktop-still-a-big-player/|title=Stone Temple}} [[Mobile phone|Cell phones]]</ref> are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data capacity increases. [[Sabotage]] usually consists of the destruction of an organization's [[website]] in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers. Information extortion consists of theft of a company's property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner, as with [[ransomware]]. There are many ways to help protect yourself from some of these attacks but one of the most functional precautions is user carefulness.

[[Governments]], [[military]], [[corporation]]s, [[financial institution]]s, [[hospital]]s and private [[businesses]] amass a great deal of confidential information about their employees, customers, products, research and financial status. Should confidential information about a business' customers or finances or new product line fall into the hands of a competitor or a [[black hat hacker]], a business and its customers could suffer widespread, irreparable financial loss, as well as damage to the company's reputation. From a business perspective, information security must be balanced against cost; the [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] provides a mathematical economic approach for addressing this concern.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Lawrence|last2=Loeb|first2=Martin|title=The Economics of Information Security Investment|journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security|date=November 2002|volume=5|issue=4|pages=438–457|doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}</ref>

For the individual, information security has a significant effect on [[privacy]], which is viewed very differently in various [[cultures]].

==== Responses to threats ====
Possible responses to a security threat or [[IT risk management|risk]] are:<ref>{{Cite book|title=CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide Sixth Edition|last=Stewart|first=James|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-1-118-31417-3|location=Canada|pages=255–257}}</ref>
* reduce/mitigate – implement safeguards and countermeasures to eliminate vulnerabilities or block threats
* assign/transfer – place the cost of the threat onto another entity or organization such as purchasing insurance or outsourcing
* accept – evaluate if the cost of the countermeasure outweighs the possible cost of loss due to the threat

== History ==

Since the early days of communication, diplomats and military commanders understood that it was necessary to provide some mechanism to protect the confidentiality of correspondence and to have some means of detecting [[Tamper-evident|tampering]]. [[Julius Caesar]] is credited with the invention of the [[Caesar cipher]] c. 50 B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands; however, for the most part protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Gaius|last1=Suetonius Tranquillus|title=Lives of the Caesars (Oxford World's Classics)|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-953756-3|page=28|authorlink=Suetonius}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Code Book]] |last=Singh |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Singh |year=2000 |publisher=Anchor |isbn=0-385-49532-3 |pages=289–290 }}</ref> Sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be protected and transported by trusted persons, guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong box. As postal services expanded, governments created official organizations to intercept, decipher, read and reseal letters (e.g., the U.K.'s Secret Office, founded in 1653<ref name="JohnsonTheEvo97">{{cite book |first=John |last=Johnson |title=The Evolution of British Sigint: 1653–1939 |year=1997 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |asin=B00GYX1GX2}}</ref>).

In the mid-nineteenth century more complex [[Classified information|classification systems]] were developed to allow governments to manage their information according to the degree of sensitivity. For example, the British Government codified this, to some extent, with the publication of the [[Official Secrets Act 1889|Official Secrets Act]] in 1889.<ref name="HastedtSpies11">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8WoNp2vI-cC&pg=PA589 |chapter=Official Secrets Act (1889; New 1911; Amended 1920, 1939, 1989) |title=Spies, Wiretaps, and Secret Operations: An Encyclopedia of American Espionage |volume=2 |author=Ruppert, K. |editor=Hastedt, G.P. |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2011 |pages=589–590 |isbn=9781851098088}}</ref> By the time of the [[First World War]], multi-tier classification systems were used to communicate information to and from various fronts, which encouraged greater use of code making and breaking sections in diplomatic and military headquarters. Encoding became more sophisticated between the wars as machines were employed to scramble and unscramble information. The volume of information shared by the Allied countries during the [[Second World War]] necessitated formal alignment of classification systems and procedural controls. An arcane range of markings evolved to indicate who could handle documents (usually officers rather than enlisted troops) and where they should be stored as increasingly complex safes and storage facilities were developed. The [[Enigma Machine]], which was employed by the Germans to encrypt the data of warfare and was successfully decrypted by [[Alan Turing]], can be regarded as a striking example of creating and using secured information.<ref name="Sebag-MontefioreEnigma11">{{cite book |title=Enigma: The Battle for the Code |author=Sebag–Montefiore, H. |publisher=Orion |pages=576 |year=2011 |isbn=9781780221236}}</ref> Procedures evolved to ensure documents were destroyed properly, and it was the failure to follow these procedures which led to some of the greatest intelligence coups of the war (e.g., the capture of [[U-570]]<ref name="Sebag-MontefioreEnigma11" />).

The end of the twentieth century and the early years of the twenty-first century saw rapid advancements in [[telecommunications]], computing [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]], and data [[encryption]]. The availability of smaller, more powerful and less expensive computing equipment made [[Data processing|electronic data processing]] within the reach of [[small business]] and the home user. These computers quickly became interconnected through the [[internet]].

The rapid growth and widespread use of electronic data processing and [[electronic business]] conducted through the internet, along with numerous occurrences of international [[terrorism]], fueled the need for better methods of protecting the computers and the information they store, process and transmit.<ref name="DeLeeuwTheHist07">{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 24: A History of Internet Security |title=The History of Information Security: A Comprehensive Handbook |author=DeNardis, L. |editor1=de Leeuw, K.M.M.|editor2=Bergstra, J. |publisher=Elsevier |pages=681–704 |year=2007 |isbn=9780080550589}}</ref> The academic disciplines of [[computer security]] and [[information assurance]] emerged along with numerous professional organizations, all sharing the common goals of ensuring the security and reliability of information systems.

== Definitions ==
[[File:CIAJMK1209.png|thumb|'''Information Security Attributes''': or qualities, i.e., [[Confidentiality]], [[Data integrity|Integrity]] and [[Availability]] (CIA). [[Information Systems]] are composed in three main portions, hardware, software and communications with the purpose to help identify and apply information security industry standards, as mechanisms of protection and prevention, at three levels or layers: [[Physical information security|physical]], personal and organizational. Essentially, procedures or policies are implemented to tell administrators, users and operators how to use products to ensure information security within the organizations.<ref name="Cherdantseva Y 2013">Cherdantseva Y. and Hilton J.: "Information Security and Information Assurance.

== Basic principles ==

=== Key concepts ===
[[File:Posters for information security for the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.jpg|thumb|Poster promoting information security by the Russian [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defence]]]]
The CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is at the heart of information security.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perrin|first=Chad|title=The CIA Triad|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/security/the-cia-triad/488|accessdate=31 May 2012}}</ref> (The members of the classic InfoSec triad—confidentiality, integrity and availability—are interchangeably referred to in the literature as security attributes, properties, security goals, fundamental aspects, information criteria, critical information characteristics and basic building blocks.) However, debate continues about whether or not this CIA triad is sufficient to address rapidly changing technology and business requirements, with recommendations to consider expanding on the intersections between availability and confidentiality, as well as the relationship between security and privacy.<ref name="SamonasTheCIA14" /> Other principles such as "accountability" have sometimes been proposed; it has been pointed out that issues such as [[non-repudiation]] do not fit well within the three core concepts.<ref name="NIST">{{cite web |title=Engineering Principles for Information Technology Security |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-27A/SP800-27-RevA.pdf |publisher=csrc.nist.gov}}</ref>

In 1992 and revised in 2002, the [[OECD]]'s ''Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/22/15582260.pdf |title=oecd.org |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516085505/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/22/15582260.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2011 }}</ref> proposed the nine generally accepted principles: [[information security awareness|awareness]], responsibility, response, ethics, democracy, risk assessment, security design and implementation, security management, and reassessment. Building upon those, in 2004 the [[NIST]]'s ''Engineering Principles for Information Technology Security''<ref name="NIST" /> proposed 33 principles. From each of these derived guidelines and practices.

In 1998, [[Donn Parker]] proposed an alternative model for the classic CIA triad that he called the [[Parkerian Hexad|six atomic elements of information]]. The elements are [[confidentiality]], [[ownership|possession]], [[integrity]], [[authentication|authenticity]], [[availability]], and [[utility]]. The merits of the [[Parkerian Hexad]] are a subject of debate amongst security professionals.<ref>{{cite web|last=Slade|first=Rob|url=http://blog.isc2.org/isc2_blog/2008/12/cia-triad-versus-parkerian-hexad.html|title=(ICS)2 Blog}}</ref>

In 2011, [[The Open Group]] published the information security management standard [[Open Information Security Maturity Model|O-ISM3]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Aceituno|first=Vicente|title=Open Information Security Maturity Model|url=http://www.ism3.com/node/39|accessdate=12 February 2017}}</ref> This standard proposed an [[operational definition]] of the key concepts of security, with elements called "security objectives", related to [[access control]] (9), [[availability]] (3), [[data quality]] (1), [[standards-compliant|compliance]] and technical (4). In 2009, [[DoD]] [https://spi.dod.mil/ Software Protection Initiative] released the [https://spi.dod.mil/threat.htm Three Tenets of Cybersecurity] which are System Susceptibility, Access to the Flaw, and Capability to Exploit the Flaw.<ref>http://www.dartmouth.edu/~gvc/ThreeTenetsSPIE.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.timreview.ca/article/712|title=Quantitative Metrics and Risk Assessment: The Three Tenets Model of Cybersecurity|first1=Jeff|last1=Hughes|first2=George|last2=Cybenko|date=21 June 2018|journal=Technology Innovation Management Review|volume=3|issue=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.continuum.net/blog/are-your-clients-falling-for-these-it-security-myths-chart|title=Are Your Clients Falling for These IT Security Myths? [CHART]|first=Lily|last=Teplow|website=continuum.net}}</ref> Neither of these models are widely adopted.

==== Confidentiality ====
In information security, confidentiality "is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes."<ref name="BeckersPattern15">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DvdICAAAQBAJ&pg=PA100 |title=Pattern and Security Requirements: Engineering-Based Establishment of Security Standards |author=Beckers, K. |publisher=Springer |page=100 |year=2015 |isbn=9783319166643}}</ref> While similar to "privacy," the two words aren't interchangeable. Rather, confidentiality is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers. Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft, password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals.<ref name="AndressTheBasics14" />

==== Integrity ====
In information security, [[data integrity]] means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boritz|first=J. Efrim|title=IS Practitioners' Views on Core Concepts of Information Integrity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467089505000473|work=International Journal of Accounting Information Systems|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=12 August 2011|doi=10.1016/j.accinf.2005.07.001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=260–279}}</ref>  This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. This is not the same thing as [[referential integrity]] in [[databases]], although it can be viewed as a special case of consistency as understood in the classic [[ACID]] model of [[transaction processing]]. Information security systems typically provide message integrity along side to confidentiality.

==== Availability ====
For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be [[availability|available]] when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the [[security controls]] used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly. [[High availability]] systems aim to remain available at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures, and system upgrades. Ensuring availability also involves preventing [[denial-of-service attack]]s, such as a flood of incoming messages to the target system, essentially forcing it to shut down.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Loukas | first1 = G. | last2 = Oke | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1093/comjnl/bxp078 | title = Protection Against Denial of Service Attacks: A Survey | journal = [[The Computer Journal|Comput. J.]] | volume = 53 | issue = 7 | pages = 1020–1037 | date=September 2010 | origyear = August 2009| pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://staffweb.cms.gre.ac.uk/~lg47/publications/LoukasOke-DoSSurveyComputerJournal.pdf}}</ref>

In the realm of information security, availability can often be viewed as one of the most important parts of a successful information security program. Ultimately end-users need to be able to perform job functions; by ensuring availability an organization is able to perform to the standards that an organization's stakeholders expect. This can involve topics such as proxy configurations, outside web access, the ability to access shared drives and the ability to send emails. Executives oftentimes do not understand the technical side of information security and look at availability as an easy fix, but this often requires collaboration from many different organizational teams, such as network operations, development operations, incident response and policy/change management. A successful information security team involves many different key roles to mesh and align for the CIA triad to be provided effectively.

[[File:CIAJMK1209.png|thumb|CIA triad methodology]]

==== Non-repudiation ====
In law, [[non-repudiation]] implies one's intention to fulfill their obligations to a contract. It also implies that one party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent a transaction.<ref name="BidgoliHandbook06">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0RfANAwOUdIC&pg=PA65 |chapter=Digital Libraries: Security and Preservation Considerations |title=Handbook of Information Security, Threats, Vulnerabilities, Prevention, Detection, and Management |author=McCarthy, C. |editor=Bidgoli, H. |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |volume=3 |pages=49–76 |year=2006 |isbn=9780470051214}}</ref>

It is important to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation efforts, the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender's private key, and thus only the sender could have sent the message, and nobody else could have altered it in transit ([[data integrity]]). The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with the sender, and such assertions may or may not relieve the sender of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity. As such, the sender may repudiate the message (because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation).

== Risk management ==
{{Main|Risk management}}

The ''[[Certified Information Systems Auditor]] (CISA) Review Manual 2006'' provides the following definition of risk management: "Risk management is the process of identifying [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and [[threat (computer)|threats]] to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and deciding what [[Countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]], if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization."<ref>{{cite book|title=CISA Review Manual 2006|last=ISACA|first=|publisher=Information Systems Audit and Control Association|year=2006|isbn=1-933284-15-3|location=|page=85|pages=}}</ref>

There are two things in this definition that may need some clarification. First, the ''process'' of risk management is an ongoing, iterative [[Business process|process]]. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment is constantly changing and new [[threat (computer)|threats]] and [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] emerge every day. Second, the choice of [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] ([[security controls|controls]]) used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity, cost, effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected.

Risk analysis and risk evaluation processes have their limitations since, when security incidents occur, they emerge in a context, and their rarity and uniqueness give rise to unpredictable threats. The analysis of these phenomena, which are characterized by breakdowns, surprises and side-effects, requires a theoretical approach that is able to examine and interpret subjectively the detail of each incident.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Spagnoletti|first=Paolo|author2=Resca A.|title=The duality of Information Security Management: fighting against predictable and unpredictable threats|journal=Journal of Information System Security|year=2008|volume=4|issue=3|pages=46–62|url=http://eprints.luiss.it/955/}}</ref>

Risk is the likelihood that something bad will happen that causes harm to an informational asset (or the loss of the asset). A vulnerability is a weakness that could be used to endanger or cause harm to an informational asset. A threat is anything (man-made or [[natural disaster|act of nature]]) that has the potential to cause harm.

The likelihood that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause harm creates a risk. When a threat does use a vulnerability to inflict harm, it has an impact. In the context of information security, the impact is a loss of availability, integrity, and confidentiality, and possibly other losses (lost income, loss of life, loss of real property).<ref name="GramaLegal14">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqoyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT38 |title=Legal Issues in Information Security |author=Grama, J.L. |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |pages=550 |year=2014 |isbn=9781284151046}}</ref> It should be pointed out that it is not possible to identify all risks, nor is it possible to eliminate all risk. The remaining risk is called "residual risk."

A [[risk assessment]] is carried out by a team of people who have knowledge of specific areas of the business. Membership of the team may vary over time as different parts of the business are assessed. The assessment may use a subjective qualitative analysis based on informed opinion, or where reliable dollar figures and historical information is available, the analysis may use [[Statistics|quantitative]] analysis.

Research has shown that the most vulnerable point in most information systems is the human user, operator, designer, or other human.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kiountouzis| first1=E.A.|last2=Kokolakis|first2=S.A.|title=Information systems security: facing the information society of the 21st century|publisher=Chapman & Hall, Ltd.|location= London|isbn=0-412-78120-4}}</ref> The [[ISO/IEC 17799|ISO/IEC 27002:2005]] Code of practice for [[information security management]] recommends the following be examined during a risk assessment:
* [[security policy]],
* [[organization]] of information security,

# Identification of assets and estimating their value. Include: people, buildings, hardware, software, data (electronic, print, other), supplies.
# Conduct a [[threat assessment]]. Include: Acts of nature, acts of war, accidents, malicious acts originating from inside or outside the organization.
# Conduct a [[vulnerability assessment]], and for each vulnerability, calculate the probability that it will be exploited. Evaluate policies, procedures, standards, training, [[physical security]], [[quality control]], technical security.
# Calculate the impact that each threat would have on each asset. Use qualitative analysis or quantitative analysis.
# Identify, select and implement appropriate controls. Provide a proportional response. Consider productivity, cost effectiveness, and value of the asset.
# Evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. Ensure the controls provide the required cost effective protection without discernible loss of productivity.

For any given risk, management can choose to accept the risk based upon the relative low value of the asset, the relative low frequency of occurrence, and the relative low impact on the business. Or, leadership may choose to mitigate the risk by selecting and implementing appropriate control measures to reduce the risk. In some cases, the risk can be transferred to another business by buying insurance or outsourcing to another business.<ref name=SP80030>{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf |title=NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-01-17}}</ref> The reality of some risks may be disputed. In such cases leadership may choose to deny the risk.

=== Security controls ===
{{Main|security controls}}
Selecting and implementing proper security controls will initially help an organization bring down risk to acceptable levels. Control selection should follow and should be based on the risk assessment. Controls can vary in nature, but fundamentally they are ways of protecting the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information. [[ISO/IEC 27001]] has defined controls in different areas. Organizations can implement additional controls according to requirement of the organization.<ref name="JohnsonSecurity15">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7SYBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |title=Security Controls Evaluation, Testing, and Assessment Handbook |author=Johnson, L. |publisher=Syngress |pages=678 |year=2015 |isbn=9780128025642}}</ref> [[ISO/IEC 27002]] offers a guideline for organizational information security standards.

==== Administrative ====
Administrative controls consist of approved written policies, procedures, standards and guidelines. Administrative controls form the framework for running the business and managing people. They inform people on how the business is to be run and how day-to-day operations are to be conducted. Laws and regulations created by government bodies are also a type of administrative control because they inform the business. Some industry sectors have policies, procedures, standards and guidelines that must be followed – the [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|Payment Card Industry Data Sec]]<ref name=":0" />[[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|urity Sta]][[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|ndard]] (PCI DSS) required by [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]] is such an example. Other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy, [[password policy]], hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.

Administrative controls form the basis for the selection and implementation of logical and physical controls. Logical and physical controls are manifestations of administrative controls, which are of paramount importance.

==== Logical ====
Logical controls (also called technical controls) use software and data to monitor and control access to information and computing systems. Passwords, network and host-based firewalls, network [[intrusion detection]] systems, [[access control list]]s, and data encryption are examples of logical controls.

An important logical control that is frequently overlooked is the principle of least privilege, which requires that an individual, program or system process not be granted any more access privileges than are necessary to perform the task.<ref name="RansomeCore13">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MX5cAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA40 |title=Core Software Security: Security at the Source |author1=Ransome, J.|author2=Misra, A. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=40–41 |year=2013 |isbn=9781466560956}}</ref> A blatant example of the failure to adhere to the principle of least privilege is logging into Windows as user Administrator to read email and surf the web. Violations of this principle can also occur when an individual collects additional access privileges over time. This happens when employees' job duties change, employees are promoted to a new position, or employees are transferred to another department. The access privileges required by their new duties are frequently added onto their already existing access privileges, which may no longer be necessary or appropriate.

==== Physical ====
Physical controls monitor and control the environment of the work place and computing facilities. They also monitor and control access to and from such facilities and include doors, locks, heating and air conditioning, smoke and fire alarms, fire suppression systems, cameras, barricades, fencing, security guards, cable locks, etc. Separating the network and workplace into functional areas are also physical controls.

An important physical control that is frequently overlooked is separation of duties, which ensures that an individual can not complete a critical task by himself. For example, an employee who submits a request for reimbursement should not also be able to authorize payment or print the check. An applications programmer should not also be the [[System administrator|server administrator]] or the [[database administrator]]; these roles and responsibilities must be separated from one another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isaca.org/AMTemplate.cfm?Section=CISA1&Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=40835 |title=Segregation of Duties Control matrix |year=2008 |publisher=ISACA |accessdate=2008-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703162553/http://www.isaca.org/AMTemplate.cfm?Section=CISA1&Template=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=40835 |archivedate=3 July 2011 |df= }}</ref>

=== Defense in depth<!--Section linked from [[Onion model]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--> ===
[[File:Defense In Depth - Onion Model.svg|thumb|right|The [[onion model]] of defense in depth]]
{{Main|Defense in depth (computing)}}
Information security must protect information throughout its lifespan, from the initial creation of the information on through to the final disposal of the information.  The information must be protected while in motion and while at rest. During its lifetime, information may pass through many different information processing systems and through many different parts of information processing systems. There are many different ways the information and information systems can be threatened. To fully protect the information during its lifetime, each component of the information processing system must have its own protection mechanisms. The building up, layering on and overlapping of security measures is called "defense in depth." In contrast to a metal chain, which is famously only as strong as its weakest link, the defense in depth strategy aims at a structure where, should one defensive measure fail, other measures will continue to provide protection.<ref name="VaccaComputer13">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb916YOr16wC&pg=PA546 |chapter=Chapter 31: What is Vulnerability Assessment? |title=Computer and Information Security Handbook |author=Kakareka, A. |editor=Vacca, J.R. |publisher=Elsevier |edition=2nd |pages=541–552 |year=2013 |isbn=9780123946126}}</ref>

Recall the earlier discussion about administrative controls, logical controls, and physical controls. The three types of controls can be used to form the basis upon which to build a defense in depth strategy. With this approach, defense in depth can be conceptualized as three distinct layers or planes laid one on top of the other. Additional insight into defense in depth can be gained by thinking of it as forming the layers of an onion, with data at the core of the onion, people the next outer layer of the onion, and [[network security]], host-based security and [[application security]] forming the outermost layers of the onion. Both perspectives are equally valid, and each provides valuable insight into the implementation of a good defense in depth strategy.

=== Security classification for information ===
An important aspect of information security and risk management is recognizing the value of information and defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements for the information. Not all information is equal and so not all information requires the same degree of protection. This requires information to be assigned a [[Classified information|security classification]]. The first step in information classification is to identify a member of senior management as the owner of the particular information to be classified. Next, develop a classification policy. The policy should describe the different classification labels, define the criteria for information to be assigned a particular label, and list the required [[security controls]] for each classification.<ref name="BayukEnterprise09">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxPhvm1EP3EC&pg=PA59 |chapter=Chapter 4: Information Classification |title=Enterprise Information Security and Privacy |author=Bayuk, J. |editor1=Axelrod, C.W.|editor2=Bayuk, J.L.|editor3=Schutzer, D. |publisher=Artech House |year=2009 |pages=59–70 |isbn=9781596931916}}</ref>

Some factors that influence which classification information should be assigned include how much value that information has to the organization, how old the information is and whether or not the information has become obsolete. Laws and other regulatory requirements are also important considerations when classifying information. The [[ISACA|Information Systems Audit and Control Association]] (ISACA) and its ''Business Model for Information Security'' also serves as a tool for security professionals to examine security from a systems perspective, creating an environment where security can be managed holistically, allowing actual risks to be addressed.<ref name="ISACA-BMIS">{{cite web |url=https://www.isaca.org/KNOWLEDGE-CENTER/BMIS/Pages/Business-Model-for-Information-Security.aspx |title=Business Model for Information Security (BMIS) |publisher=ISACA |accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref>

The type of information security classification labels selected and used will depend on the nature of the organization, with examples being:<ref name="BayukEnterprise09" />
* In the business sector, labels such as: Public, Sensitive, Private, Confidential.
* In the government sector, labels such as: Unclassified, Unofficial, Protected, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret and their non-English equivalents.
* In cross-sectoral formations, the [[Traffic Light Protocol]], which consists of: White, Green, Amber, and Red.

All employees in the organization, as well as business partners, must be trained on the classification schema and understand the required security controls and handling procedures for each classification. The classification of a particular information asset that has been assigned should be reviewed periodically to ensure the classification is still appropriate for the information and to ensure the security controls required by the classification are in place and are followed in their right procedures.

=== Access control ===
Access to protected information must be restricted to people who are authorized to access the information. The computer programs, and in many cases the computers that process the information, must also be authorized. This requires that mechanisms be in place to control the access to protected information. The sophistication of the access control mechanisms should be in parity with the value of the information being protected; the more sensitive or valuable the information the stronger the control mechanisms need to be. The foundation on which access control mechanisms are built start with identification and [[authentication]].

Access control is generally considered in three steps: identification, [[authentication]], and [[authorization]].<ref name="AndressTheBasics14" />

==== Identification ====
Identification is an assertion of who someone is or what something is. If a person makes the statement "Hello, my name is [[John Doe]]" they are making a claim of who they are. However, their claim may or may not be true. Before John Doe can be granted access to protected information it will be necessary to verify that the person claiming to be John Doe really is John Doe. Typically the claim is in the form of a username. By entering that username you are claiming "I am the person the username belongs to".

==== Authentication ====
Authentication is the act of verifying a claim of identity. When John Doe goes into a bank to make a withdrawal, he tells the [[bank teller]] he is John Doe, a claim of identity. The bank teller asks to see a photo ID, so he hands the teller his [[driver's license]]. The bank teller checks the license to make sure it has John Doe printed on it and compares the photograph on the license against the person claiming to be John Doe. If the photo and name match the person, then the teller has authenticated that John Doe is who he claimed to be. Similarly, by entering the correct password, the user is providing evidence that he/she is the person the username belongs to.

There are three different types of information that can be used for authentication:
* Something you know: things such as a PIN, a [[password]], or your mother's [[maiden name]]
* Something you have: a driver's license or a magnetic [[swipe card]]
* Something you are: [[biometrics]], including [[palm print]]s, [[fingerprint]]s, [[Speaker recognition|voice prints]] and [[Retina scan|retina (eye) scans]]

Strong authentication requires providing more than one type of authentication information (two-factor authentication). The [[username]] is the most common form of identification on computer systems today and the password is the most common form of authentication. Usernames and passwords have served their purpose, but they are increasingly inadequate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Akpeninor|first1=James Ohwofasa|title=Modern Concepts of Security|date=2013|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=978-1-4817-8232-6|page=135|url=https://books.google.ca/books?isbn=1481782320|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref> Usernames and passwords are slowly being replaced or supplemented with more sophisticated authentication mechanisms such as [[Time-based One-time Password Algorithm|Time-based One-time Password algorithm]]s.

==== Authorization ====
After a person, program or computer has successfully been identified and authenticated then it must be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they will be allowed to perform (run, view, create, delete, or change). This is called [[authorization]]. Authorization to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and procedures. The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. The access control mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies. Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control mechanisms. Some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms. The access control mechanism a system offers will be based upon one of three approaches to access control, or it may be derived from a combination of the three approaches.<ref name="AndressTheBasics14" />

The non-discretionary approach consolidates all access control under a centralized administration. The access to information and other resources is usually based on the individuals function (role) in the organization or the tasks the individual must perform. The discretionary approach gives the creator or owner of the information resource the ability to control access to those resources. In the mandatory access control approach, access is granted or denied basing upon the security classification assigned to the information resource.

Examples of common access control mechanisms in use today include [[Role-Based Access Control|role-based access control]], available in many advanced database management systems; simple [[File system permissions|file permissions]] provided in the UNIX and Windows operating systems; [[Group Policy Object]]s provided in Windows network systems; and [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], [[RADIUS]], [[TACACS]], and the simple access lists used in many [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] and [[Router (computing)|routers]].

To be effective, policies and other security controls must be enforceable and upheld. Effective policies ensure that people are held accountable for their actions. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]'s guidelines for systems processing sensitive or proprietary information, for example, states that all failed and successful authentication and access attempts must be logged, and all access to information must leave some type of [[audit trail]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2004reports/200420131fr.html|title=The Use of Audit Trails to Monitor Key Networks and Systems Should Remain Part of the Computer Security Material Weakness|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref>

Also, the need-to-know principle needs to be in effect when talking about access control. This principle gives access rights to a person to perform their job functions. This principle is used in the government when dealing with difference clearances. Even though two employees in different departments have a [[Classified information|top-secret clearance]], they must have a need-to-know in order for information to be exchanged. Within the need-to-know principle, network administrators grant the employee the least amount of privileges to prevent employees from accessing more than what they are supposed to. Need-to-know helps to enforce the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad. Need-to-know directly impacts the confidential area of the triad.

=== Cryptography ===
{{Main|Cryptography}}
Information security uses [[cryptography]] to transform usable information into a form that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorized user; this process is called [[encryption]]. Information that has been encrypted (rendered unusable) can be transformed back into its original usable form by an authorized user who possesses the [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]], through the process of decryption. Cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure while the [[information]] is in transit (either electronically or physically) and while information is in storage.<ref name="AndressTheBasics14" />

Cryptography provides information security with other useful applications as well, including improved authentication methods, message digests, digital signatures, [[non-repudiation]], and encrypted network communications. Older, less secure applications such as [[Telnet]] and [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) are slowly being replaced with more secure applications such as [[Secure Shell]] (SSH) that use encrypted network communications. Wireless communications can be encrypted using protocols such as [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA/WPA2]] or the older (and less secure) [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]]. Wired communications (such as [[ITU-T|ITU‑T]] [[G.hn]]) are secured using [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] for encryption and [[X.1035]] for authentication and key exchange. Software applications such as [[GnuPG]] or [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] can be used to encrypt data files and email.

Cryptography can introduce security problems when it is not implemented correctly. Cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry-accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography. The [[Key size|length and strength]] of the encryption key is also an important consideration. A key that is [[Weak key|weak]] or too short will produce weak encryption. The keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information. They must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and destruction and they must be available when needed. [[Public key infrastructure]] (PKI) solutions address many of the problems that surround [[key management]].<ref name="AndressTheBasics14" />

== Process ==
The terms "reasonable and prudent person," "[[due care]]" and "due diligence" have been used in the fields of finance, securities, and law for many years. In recent years these terms have found their way into the fields of computing and information security.<ref name="WhitmanManage16" /> U.S. [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] now make it possible to hold corporate officers liable for failing to exercise due care and due diligence in the management of their information systems.<ref name="VallabhaneniCorporate08">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BvYbQr9MV_sC&pg=PA288 |title=Corporate Management, Governance, and Ethics Best Practices |author=Vallabhaneni, S.R. |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=288 |year=2008 |isbn=9780470255803}}</ref>

In the business world, stockholders, customers, business partners and governments have the expectation that corporate officers will run the business in accordance with accepted business practices and in compliance with laws and other regulatory requirements. This is often described as the "reasonable and prudent person" rule. A prudent person takes due care to ensure that everything necessary is done to operate the business by sound business principles and in a legal, ethical manner. A prudent person is also diligent (mindful, attentive, ongoing) in their due care of the business.

In the field of information security, Harris<ref>{{cite book|author=Shon Harris|authorlink=Shon Harris|title=All-in-one CISSP Certification Exam Guide|edition=2nd|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]/Osborne|year=2003|location=[[Emeryville, California]]|isbn=0-07-222966-7}}</ref>
offers the following definitions of due care and due diligence:

<blockquote>''"Due care are steps that are taken to show that a company has taken responsibility for the activities that take place within the corporation and has taken the necessary steps to help protect the company, its resources, and employees."'' And, <nowiki>[Due diligence are the]</nowiki> ''"continual activities that make sure the protection mechanisms are continually maintained and operational."''
</blockquote>

Attention should be made to two important points in these definitions. First, in due care, steps are taken to show; this means that the steps can be verified, measured, or even produce tangible artifacts. Second, in due diligence, there are continual activities; this means that people are actually doing things to monitor and maintain the protection mechanisms, and these activities are ongoing.

Organizations have a responsibility with practicing duty of care when applying information security. The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docra.org/|title=The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard|last=|first=|date=|website=DoCRA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> provides principles and practices for evaluating risk. It considers all parties that could be affected by those risks. DoCRA helps evaluate safeguards if they are appropriate in protecting others from harm while presenting a reasonable burden. With increased data breach litigation, companies must balance security controls, compliance, and its mission.

=== Change management ===
{{Main|Change Management (ITSM)}}
{{Copypaste|section|url=https://employment.blurtit.com/1335625/how-information-system-changing-the-management-process|date=April 2018}}
Change management is a formal process for directing and controlling alterations to the information processing environment. This includes alterations to desktop computers, the network, servers and software. The objectives of change management are to reduce the risks posed by changes to the information processing environment and improve the stability and reliability of the processing environment as changes are made. It is not the objective of change management to prevent or hinder necessary changes from being implemented.<ref name="CampbellPractical16">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbWiDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA218 |chapter=Chapter 14: Secure Systems Development |title=Practical Information Security Management: A Complete Guide to Planning and Implementation |author=Campbell, T. |publisher=Apress |year=2016 |page=218 |isbn=9781484216859}}</ref>

Any change to the information processing environment introduces an element of risk. Even apparently simple changes can have unexpected effects. One of management's many responsibilities is the management of risk. Change management is a tool for managing the risks introduced by changes to the information processing environment. Part of the change management process ensures that changes are not implemented at inopportune times when they may disrupt critical business processes or interfere with other changes being implemented.

Not every change needs to be managed. Some kinds of changes are a part of the everyday routine of information processing and adhere to a predefined procedure, which reduces the overall level of risk to the processing environment. Creating a new user account or deploying a new desktop computer are examples of changes that do not generally require change management. However, relocating user file shares, or upgrading the Email server pose a much higher level of risk to the processing environment and are not a normal everyday activity. The critical first steps in change management are (a) defining change (and communicating that definition) and (b) defining the scope of the change system.

Change management is usually overseen by a change review board composed of representatives from key business areas, security, networking, systems administrators, database administration, application developers, desktop support and the help desk. The tasks of the change review board can be facilitated with the use of automated work flow application. The responsibility of the change review board is to ensure the organization's documented change management procedures are followed. The change management process is as follows<ref name="TaylorProject08">{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 10: Understanding the Project Change Process |title=Project Scheduling and Cost Control: Planning, Monitoring and Controlling the Baseline |author=Taylor, J. |publisher=J. Ross Publishing |year=2008 |pages=187–214 |isbn=9781932159110}}</ref>

* '''Request:'''  Anyone can request a change. The person making the change request may or may not be the same person that performs the analysis or implements the change. When a request for change is received, it may undergo a preliminary review to determine if the requested change is compatible with the organizations [[business model]] and practices, and to determine the amount of resources needed to implement the change.
* '''Approve:''' Management runs the business and controls the allocation of resources therefore, management must approve requests for changes and assign a priority for every change. Management might choose to reject a change request if the change is not compatible with the business model, industry standards or best practices. Management might also choose to reject a change request if the change requires more resources than can be allocated for the change.
* '''Plan:''' Planning a change involves discovering the scope and impact of the proposed change; analyzing the complexity of the change; allocation of resources and, developing, testing and documenting both implementation and back-out plans. Need to define the criteria on which a decision to back out will be made.
* '''Test:''' Every change must be tested in a safe test environment, which closely reflects the actual production environment, before the change is applied to the production environment. The backout plan must also be tested.
* '''Schedule:''' Part of the change review board's responsibility is to assist in the scheduling of changes by reviewing the proposed implementation date for potential conflicts with other scheduled changes or critical business activities.
* '''Communicate:'''  Once a change has been scheduled it must be communicated. The communication is to give others the opportunity to remind the change review board about other changes or critical business activities that might have been overlooked when scheduling the change. The communication also serves to make the help desk and users aware that a change is about to occur. Another responsibility of the change review board is to ensure that scheduled changes have been properly communicated to those who will be affected by the change or otherwise have an interest in the change.
* '''Implement:'''  At the appointed date and time, the changes must be implemented.  Part of the planning process was to develop an implementation plan, testing plan and, a back out plan. If the implementation of the change should fail or, the post implementation testing fails or, other "drop dead" criteria have been met, the back out plan should be implemented.
* '''Document:'''  All changes must be documented. The documentation includes the initial request for change, its approval, the priority assigned to it, the implementation, testing and back out plans, the results of the change review board critique, the date/time the change was implemented, who implemented it, and whether the change was implemented successfully, failed or postponed.
* '''Post-change review:'''  The change review board should hold a post-implementation review of changes. It is particularly important to review failed and backed out changes. The review board should try to understand the problems that were encountered, and look for areas for improvement.

Change management procedures that are simple to follow and easy to use can greatly reduce the overall risks created when changes are made to the information processing environment.  Good change management procedures improve the overall quality and success of changes as they are implemented. This is accomplished through planning, peer review, documentation and communication.

== Business continuity ==

Business continuity management ([[Business continuity planning|BCM]]) concerns arrangements aiming to protect an organization's critical business functions from interruption due to incidents, or at least minimize the effects. BCM is essential to any organization to keep technology and business in line with current threats to the continuation of business as usual. The BCM should be included in an organizations [[risk analysis]] plan to ensure that all of the necessary business functions have what they need to keep going in the event of any type of threat to any business function.<ref>Hotchkiss, Stuart. Business Continuity Management : In Practice, British Informatics Society Limited, 2010. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/pensu/detail.action?docID=634527.</ref>

It encompasses:
* Analysis of requirements, e.g., identifying critical business functions, dependencies and potential failure points, potential threats and hence incidents or risks of concern to the organization;
* Specification, e.g., maximum tolerable outage periods; recovery point objectives (maximum acceptable periods of data loss);
* Architecture and design, e.g., an appropriate combination of approaches including resilience (e.g. engineering IT systems and processes for high availability, avoiding or preventing situations that might interrupt the business), incident and emergency management (e.g., evacuating premises, calling the emergency services, triage/situation assessment and invoking recovery plans), recovery (e.g., rebuilding) and contingency management (generic capabilities to deal positively with whatever occurs using whatever resources are available);
* Implementation, e.g., configuring and scheduling backups, data transfers, etc., duplicating and strengthening critical elements; contracting with service and equipment suppliers;
* Testing, e.g., business continuity exercises of various types, costs and assurance levels;
* Management, e.g., defining strategies, setting objectives and goals; planning and directing the work; allocating funds, people and other resources; prioritization relative to other activities; team building, leadership, control, motivation and coordination with other business functions and activities (e.g., IT, facilities, human resources, risk management, information risk and security, operations); monitoring the situation, checking and updating the arrangements when things change; maturing the approach through continuous improvement, learning and appropriate investment;
* Assurance, e.g., testing against specified requirements; measuring, analyzing and reporting key parameters; conducting additional tests, reviews and audits for greater confidence that the arrangements will go to plan if invoked.

Whereas BCM takes a broad approach to minimizing disaster-related risks by reducing both the probability and the severity of incidents, a [[disaster recovery plan]] (DRP) focuses specifically on resuming business operations as quickly as possible after a disaster. A disaster recovery plan, invoked soon after a disaster occurs, lays out the steps necessary to recover critical [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) infrastructure. Disaster recovery planning includes establishing a planning group, performing risk assessment, establishing priorities, developing recovery strategies, preparing inventories and documentation of the plan, developing verification criteria and procedure, and lastly implementing the plan.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Disaster Recovery Plan|url=http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/recovery/disaster-recovery-plan_1164|publisher=Sans Institute|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref>

== Information security culture ==
Describing more than simply how security aware employees are, information security culture is the ideas, customs, and social behaviors of an organization that impact information security in both positive and negative ways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://securitycultureframework.net/definition-of-security-culture/|title=Definition of Security Culture|last=https://securitycultureframework.net|first=|date=09/04/2014|website=The Security Culture Framework|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. The way employees think and feel about security and the actions they take can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Roer & Petric (2017) identify seven core dimensions of information security culture in organizations:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The 2017 Security Culture Report - In depth insights into the human factor|last=Roer|first=Kai|last2=Petric|first2=Gregor|publisher=CLTRe North America, Inc|year=2017|isbn=978-1544933948|location=|pages=42-43}}</ref>

* Attitudes: Employees’ feelings and emotions about the various activities that pertain to the organizational security of information.
* Behaviors: Actual or intended activities and risk-taking actions of employees that have direct or indirect impact on information security.
* Cognition: Employees' awareness, verifiable knowledge, and beliefs regarding practices, activities, and self-efficacy relation that are related to information security.
* Communication: Ways employees communicate with each other, sense of belonging, support for security issues, and incident reporting.
* Compliance: Adherence to organizational security policies, awareness of the existence of such policies and the ability to recall the substance of such policies.
* Norms: Perceptions of security-related organizational conduct and practices that are informally deemed either normal or deviant by employees and their peers, e.g. hidden expectations regarding security behaviors and unwritten rules regarding uses of information-communication technologies.
* Responsibilities: Employees' understanding of the roles and responsibilities they have as a critical factor in sustaining or endangering the security of information, and thereby the organization.

Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of the organization Information Security "effort" and often take actions that ignore organizational information security best interests.<ref name="Andersson & Reimers 2014">Anderson, D., Reimers, K. and Barretto, C. (March 2014). Post-Secondary Education Network Security: Results of Addressing the End-User Challenge.publication date Mar 11, 2014 publication description INTED2014 (International Technology, Education, and Development Conference)</ref> Research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In ''Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change'', authors commented, "It's a never ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance." To manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.<ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003" />

* Pre-Evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze current security policy
* Strategic Planning: to come up a better awareness-program, we need to set clear targets. Clustering people is helpful to achieve it
* Operative Planning: create a good security culture based on internal communication, management buy-in, security awareness and training programs
* Implementation: should feature commitment of management, communication with organizational members, courses for all organizational members, and commitment of the employees<ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003" />
* Post-evaluation: to better gauge the effectiveness of the prior steps and build on continuous improvement

== Sources of standards ==
{{Main|Cyber Security Standards}}
The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) is a consortium of national standards institutes from 157 countries, coordinated through a secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO is the world's largest developer of standards. ISO 15443: "Information technology – Security techniques – A framework for IT security assurance", [[ISO/IEC 27002]]: "Information technology – Security techniques – Code of practice for information security management", [[ISO 20000|ISO-20000]]: "Information technology – Service management", and [[ISO/IEC 27001]]: "Information technology – Security techniques – Information security management systems – Requirements" are of particular interest to information security professionals.

The US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is a non-regulatory federal agency within the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]]. The NIST Computer Security Division
develops standards, metrics, tests and validation programs as well as publishes standards and guidelines to increase secure IT planning, implementation, management and operation.  NIST is also the custodian of the U.S. [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] publications (FIPS).

[[The Internet Society]] is a professional membership society with more than 100 organizations and over 20,000 individual members in over 180 countries. It provides leadership in addressing issues that confront the future of the internet, and it is the organizational home for the groups responsible for internet infrastructure standards, including the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) and the [[Internet Architecture Board]] (IAB). The ISOC hosts the Requests for Comments (RFCs) which includes the Official Internet Protocol Standards and the RFC-2196 [[Site Security Handbook]].

The [[Information Security Forum]] (ISF) is a global nonprofit organization of several hundred leading organizations in financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications, consumer goods, government, and other areas. It undertakes research into information security practices and offers advice in its biannual [[Standard of Good Practice]] and more detailed advisories for members.

The [[Institute of Information Security Professionals]] (IISP) is an independent, non-profit body governed by its members, with the principal objective of advancing the professionalism of information security practitioners and thereby the professionalism of the industry as a whole. The institute developed the IISP Skills Framework. This framework describes the range of competencies expected of information security and information assurance professionals in the effective performance of their roles. It was developed through collaboration between both private and public sector organizations and world-renowned academics and security leaders.<ref>{{cite web|title=IISP Skills Framework|url=https://www.iisp.org/imis15/iisp/Accreditation/Our_Skills_Framework/iispv2/Accreditation/Our_Skills_Framework.aspx?hkey=e77a6f03-9498-423e-aa7b-585381290ec4}}</ref>

The German [[Federal Office for Information Security]] (in German ''Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)'') BSI-Standards 100-1 to 100-4 are a set of recommendations including "methods, processes, procedures, approaches and measures relating to information security".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Publications/BSIStandards/BSIStandards_node.html;jsessionid=8FB8A442EDCF66AECC34651426C22D11.2_cid359|title=BSI-Standards|last=|first=|date=|publisher=BSI|work=|accessdate=29 November 2013}}</ref> The BSI-Standard 100-2 ''IT-Grundschutz Methodology'' describes how information security management can be implemented and operated. The standard includes a very specific guide, the [[IT Baseline Protection Catalogs]] (also known as IT-Grundschutz Catalogs). Before 2005, the catalogs were formerly known as "[[IT baseline protection|IT Baseline Protection]] Manual". The Catalogs are a collection of documents useful for detecting and combating security-relevant weak points in the IT environment (IT cluster). The collection encompasses as of September 2013 over 4,400 pages with the introduction and catalogs. The IT-Grundschutz approach is aligned with to the ISO/IEC 2700x family.

The [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] standardized a catalog of [[information security indicators]], headed by the Industrial Specification Group (ISG) ISI.
