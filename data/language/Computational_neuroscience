Computational neuroscience focuses on the description of [[Biology|biologically]] plausible [[neuron]]s (and [[Nervous system|neural systems]]) and their physiology and dynamics, and it is therefore not concerned with biologically unrealistic disciplines such as [[connectionism]], [[machine learning]], [[artificial neural network]]s, [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computational learning theory]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encephalos.gr/48-1-01e.htm|title=Encephalos Journal|website=www.encephalos.gr|access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zorzi|first=Marco|last2=Testolin|first2=Alberto|last3=Stoianov|first3=Ivilin P.|date=2013-08-20|title=Modeling language and cognition with deep unsupervised learning: a tutorial overview|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00515|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3747356|pmid=23970869}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e953/59bc80e624a963a3d8c943e3b2898a397ef7.pdf|title=Organismically-inspired robotics: homeostatic adaptation and teleology beyond the closed sensorimotor loop|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pPv0STSos8C&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22biological+realism%22#v=onepage&q=%22biological%20realism%22&f=false|title=Connectionism in Perspective|last=Pfeifer|first=R.|last2=Schreter|first2=Z.|last3=Fogelman-Soulié|first3=F.|last4=Steels|first4=L.|date=1989-08-23|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780444598769|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=comparativephilosophy|title=ANALYTIC AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shai|first=Adam|last2=Larkum|first2=Matthew Evan|date=2017-12-05|title=Branching into brains|url=https://elifesciences.org/articles/33066|journal=eLife|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.7554/eLife.33066|issn=2050-084X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2012-02-22|title=Turing centenary: Is the brain a good model for machine intelligence?|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/482462a|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=482|issue=7386|pages=462–463|doi=10.1038/482462a|issn=0028-0836}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV9TZzOITMwC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=%22biological%20plausibility%22&f=false#v=onepage&q=%22biological%20plausibility%22&f=false|title=Neural Network Perspectives on Cognition and Adaptive Robotics|last=Browne|first=A.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780750304559|language=en}}</ref>

In theory, computational neuroscience would be a sub-field of theoretical neuroscience which employs computational simulations to validate and solve the mathematical models. However, since the biologically plausible mathematical models formulated in neuroscience are in most cases too complex to be solved analytically, the two terms are essentially synonyms and are used interchangeably.<ref name=":0" /> The term mathematical neuroscience is also used sometimes, to stress the quantitative nature of the field.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gutkin|first=Boris|last2=Pinto|first2=David|last3=Ermentrout|first3=Bard|date=March 2003|title=Mathematical neuroscience: from neurons to circuits to systems|journal=Journal of Physiology, Paris|volume=97|issue=2-3|pages=209–219|doi=10.1016/j.jphysparis.2003.09.005|issn=0928-4257|pmid=14766142}}</ref>

The mathematical models formulated in computational neuroscience are useful since they capture the essential features of the biological system at multiple spatial-temporal scales, from membrane currents, proteins, and chemical coupling to [[neural oscillation|network oscillations]], columnar and topographic architecture, and learning and memory. Furthermore, these computational models frame hypotheses that can be directly tested by biological or psychological experiments.

==History==

The term 'computational neuroscience' was introduced by [[Eric L. Schwartz]], who organized a conference, held in 1985 in [[Carmel, California]], at the request of the Systems Development Foundation to provide a summary of the current status of a field which until that point was referred to by a variety of names, such as neural modeling, brain theory and neural networks. The proceedings of this definitional meeting were published in 1990 as the book ''Computational Neuroscience''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Schwartz, Eric |title=Computational neuroscience |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=0-262-19291-8 }}</ref> The first open international meeting focused on Computational Neuroscience was organized by [[James M. Bower]]  and John Miller in [[San Francisco, California]] in 1989 and has continued each year since as the annual CNS meeting.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bower, James M. |title=20 years of Computational neuroscience |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin, Germany |year=2013 |isbn=978-1461414230}}</ref> The first graduate educational program in computational neuroscience was organized as the Computational and Neural Systems Ph.D. program at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1985.

The early historical roots of the field can be traced to the work of people such as [[Louis Lapicque]], [[Alan Hodgkin|Hodgkin]] & [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], [[David H. Hubel|Hubel]] & [[Torsten Wiesel|Wiesel]], and [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], to name a few. Lapicque introduced the [[integrate and fire]] model of the neuron in a seminal article published in 1907.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lapicque L |title= Recherches quantitatives sur l'excitation électrique des nerfs traitée comme une polarisation |journal=J. Physiol. Pathol. Gen. |volume=9 |pages=620–635 |year=1907}}</ref> This model is still popular today for [[artificial neural network]]s studies because of its simplicity (see a recent review<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brunel N, Van Rossum MC |title= Lapicque's 1907 paper: from frogs to integrate-and-fire |journal=Biol. Cybern. |volume=97 |pages=337–339 |year=2007 |pmid=17968583 |doi=10.1007/s00422-007-0190-0 |issue=5–6}}</ref>).

About 40 years later, Hodgkin & Huxley developed the [[voltage clamp]] and created the first biophysical model of the [[action potential]]. Hubel & Wiesel discovered that neurons in the [[primary visual cortex]], the first cortical area to process information coming from the [[retina]], have oriented receptive fields and are organized in columns.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hubel DH, Wiesel TN |title=Receptive fields, binocular interaction and functional architecture in the cat's visual cortex |journal=J. Physiol. |volume=160 |pages=106–54 |year=1962 |pmid=14449617 |pmc=1359523 |doi= 10.1113/jphysiol.1962.sp006837|url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14449617 |issue=1}}</ref> David Marr's work focused on the interactions between neurons, suggesting computational approaches to the study of how functional groups of neurons within the [[hippocampus]] and [[neocortex]] interact, store, process, and transmit information. Computational modeling of biophysically realistic neurons and dendrites began with the work of [[Wilfrid Rall]], with the first multicompartmental model using [[cable theory]].

==Major topics==
Research in computational neuroscience can be roughly categorized into several lines of inquiry. Most computational neuroscientists collaborate closely with experimentalists in analyzing novel data and synthesizing new models of biological phenomena.

===Single-neuron modeling===
{{main|Biological neuron models}}
Even single neurons have complex biophysical characteristics and can perform computations (e.g.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=Intracellular Calcium Dynamics Permit a Purkinje Neuron Model to Perform Toggle and Gain Computations Upon its Inputs. |journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience |volume=8 |pages=86 |year=2014 | doi=10.3389/fncom.2014.00086 | url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fncom.2014.00086/full |pmid=25191262 |pmc=4138505}}</ref>). Hodgkin and Huxley's [[Hodgkin–Huxley model|original model]] only employed two voltage-sensitive currents (Voltage sensitive ion channels are glycoprotein molecules which extend through the lipid bilayer, allowing ions to traverse under certain conditions through the axolemma), the fast-acting sodium and the inward-rectifying potassium. Though successful in predicting the timing and qualitative features of the action potential, it nevertheless failed to predict a number of important features such as adaptation and [[shunting]]. Scientists now believe that there are a wide variety of voltage-sensitive currents, and the implications of the differing dynamics, modulations, and sensitivity of these currents is an important topic of computational neuroscience.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Wu, Samuel Miao-sin |author2=Johnston, Daniel |title=Foundations of cellular neurophysiology |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1995 |isbn=0-262-10053-3 }}</ref>

The computational functions of complex [[dendrites]] are also under intense investigation. There is a large body of literature regarding how different currents interact with geometric properties of neurons.<ref>{{cite book |author=Koch, Christof |title=Biophysics of computation: information processing in single neurons |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-510491-9 }}</ref>

Some models are also tracking biochemical pathways at very small scales such as spines or synaptic clefts.

There are many software packages, such as  [[GENESIS (software)|GENESIS]] and [[Neuron (software)|NEURON]], that allow rapid and systematic ''in silico'' modeling of realistic neurons. [[Blue Brain]], a project founded by [[Henry Markram]] from the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]], aims to construct a biophysically detailed simulation of a [[cortical column]] on the [[Blue Gene]] [[supercomputer]].

Modeling the richness of biophysical properties on the single-neuron scale can supply mechanisms that serve as the building blocks for network dynamics.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Forrest MD|year=2014|title=Intracellular Calcium Dynamics Permit a Purkinje Neuron Model to Perform Toggle and Gain Computations Upon its Inputs.|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fncom.2014.00086/full|journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=86|doi=10.3389/fncom.2014.00086|pmc=4138505|pmid=25191262}}</ref> However, detailed neuron descriptions are computationally expensive and this can handicap the pursuit of realistic network investigations, where many neurons need to be simulated. As a result, researchers that study large neural circuits typically represent each neuron and synapse with an artificially simple model, ignoring much of the biological detail. Hence there is a drive to produce simplified neuron models that can retain significant biological fidelity at a low computational overhead. Algorithms have been developed to produce faithful, faster running, simplified surrogate neuron models from computationally expensive, detailed neuron models.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=Simulation of alcohol action upon a detailed Purkinje neuron model and a simpler surrogate model that runs >400 times faster |journal= BMC Neuroscience | volume=16 |issue=27 | date=April  2015 |doi=10.1186/s12868-015-0162-6 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/16/27 }}</ref>

===Development, axonal patterning, and guidance===
Computational neuroscience aims to address a wide array of questions. How do [[axons]] and [[dendrites]] form during development? How do axons know where to target and how to reach these targets? How do neurons migrate to the proper position in the central and peripheral systems? How do synapses form? We know from [[molecular biology]] that distinct parts of the nervous system release distinct chemical cues, from [[growth factors]] to [[hormones]] that modulate and influence the growth and development of functional connections between neurons.

Theoretical investigations into the formation and patterning of synaptic connection and morphology are still nascent. One hypothesis that has recently garnered some attention is the ''minimal wiring hypothesis'', which postulates that the formation of axons and dendrites effectively minimizes resource allocation while maintaining maximal information storage.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chklovskii DB, Mel BW, Svoboda K |title=Cortical rewiring and information storage |journal=Nature |volume=431 |issue=7010 |pages=782–8 |date=October 2004|pmid=15483599 |doi=10.1038/nature03012 |bibcode = 2004Natur.431..782C }}<br/>Review article</ref>

===Sensory processing===
Early models of sensory processing understood within a theoretical framework are credited to [[Horace Barlow]]. Somewhat similar to the minimal wiring hypothesis described in the preceding section, Barlow understood the processing of the early sensory systems to be a form of  [[efficient coding hypothesis|efficient coding]], where the neurons encoded information which minimized the number of spikes. Experimental and computational work have since supported this hypothesis in one form or another.

Current research in sensory processing is divided among a biophysical modelling of different subsystems and a more theoretical modelling of perception. Current models of perception have suggested that the brain performs some form of [[Bayesian approaches to brain function|Bayesian inference]] and integration of different sensory information in generating our perception of the physical world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weiss|first1=Yair|last2=Simoncelli|first2=Eero P.|last3=Adelson|first3=Edward H.|title=Motion illusions as optimal percepts|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=20 May 2002|volume=5|issue=6|pages=598–604|doi=10.1038/nn0602-858}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=Marc O.|last2=Bülthoff|first2=Heinrich H.|title=Merging the senses into a robust percept|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=April 2004|volume=8|issue=4|pages=162–169|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.02.002}}</ref>

===Memory and synaptic plasticity===
{{main|Synaptic plasticity}}
Earlier models of [[memory]] are primarily based on the postulates of [[Hebbian learning]]. Biologically relevant models such as  [[Hopfield net]] have been developed to address the properties of associative (also known as "content-addressable") style of memory that occur in biological systems. These attempts are primarily focusing on the formation of medium- and [[long-term memory]], localizing in the [[hippocampus]]. Models of [[working memory]], relying on theories of network oscillations and persistent activity, have been built to capture some features of the prefrontal cortex in context-related memory.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Durstewitz D, Seamans JK, Sejnowski TJ |title=Neurocomputational models of working memory |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=3 |issue=Suppl |pages=1184–91 |year=2000 |pmid=11127836 |doi=10.1038/81460 |url=}}</ref> Additional models look at the close relationship between the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex and how that contributes to working memory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/CABN.1.2.137.pdf|title=Interactions between frontal cortex and basal ganglia in working memory: A computational model|last=|first=|date=|website=link.springer.com|doi=10.3758/cabn.1.2.137.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>

One of the major problems in neurophysiological memory is how it is maintained and changed through multiple time scales. Unstable [[synapses]] are easy to train but also prone to stochastic disruption. Stable  [[synapses]] forget less easily, but they are also harder to consolidate. One recent computational hypothesis involves cascades of plasticity that allow synapses to function at multiple time scales.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fusi S, Drew PJ, Abbott LF |title=Cascade models of synaptically stored memories |journal=Neuron |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=599–611 |year=2005 |pmid=15721245 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.02.001 }}</ref> Stereochemically detailed models of the [[acetylcholine receptor]]-based synapse with the [[Monte Carlo method]], working at the time scale of microseconds, have been built.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Coggan JS, Bartol TM, Esquenazi E |title=Evidence for ectopic neurotransmission at a neuronal synapse |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5733 |pages=446–51 |year=2005 |pmid=16020730 |pmc=2915764 |doi=10.1126/science.1108239 |bibcode = 2005Sci...309..446C |display-authors=etal}}</ref> It is likely that computational tools will contribute greatly to our understanding of how synapses function and change in relation to external stimulus in the coming decades.

===Behaviors of networks===
Biological neurons are connected to each other in a complex, recurrent fashion. These connections are, unlike most [[artificial neural networks]], sparse and usually specific.  It is not known how information is transmitted through such sparsely connected networks, although specific areas of the brain, such as the [[Visual cortex]], are understood in some detail.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olshausen|first=Bruno A.|last2=Field|first2=David J.|date=1997-12-01|title=Sparse coding with an overcomplete basis set: A strategy employed by V1?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698997001697|journal=Vision Research|volume=37|issue=23|pages=3311–3325|doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(97)00169-7}}</ref> It is also unknown what the computational functions of these specific connectivity patterns are, if any.

The interactions of neurons in a small network can be often reduced to simple models such as the [[Ising model]]. The [[statistical mechanics]] of such simple systems are well-characterized theoretically. There has been some recent evidence that suggests that dynamics of arbitrary neuronal networks can be reduced to pairwise interactions.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schneidman E, Berry MJ, Segev R, Bialek W |title=Weak pairwise correlations imply strongly correlated network states in a neural population |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7087 |pages=1007–12 |year=2006 |pmid=16625187 |pmc=1785327 |doi=10.1038/nature04701 |bibcode=2006Natur.440.1007S|arxiv = q-bio/0512013 }}</ref> It is not known, however, whether such descriptive dynamics impart any important computational function. With the emergence of [[two-photon microscopy]] and [[calcium imaging]], we now have powerful experimental methods with which to test the new theories regarding neuronal networks.

In some cases the complex interactions between ''inhibitory'' and ''excitatory'' neurons can be simplified using [[mean field theory]], which gives rise to the [[Wilson-Cowan model|population model]] of neural networks <ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wilson, H. R. |author2=Cowan, J.D. |title=A mathematical theory of the functional dynamics of cortical and thalamic nervous tissue 
|journal=Kybernetik |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=55-80 |year=1973 |doi= 10.1007/BF00288786}}</ref>. While many neurotheorists prefer such models with reduced complexity, others argue that uncovering structural functional relations depends on including as much neuronal and network structure as possible. Models of this type are typically built in large simulation platforms like GENESIS or NEURON. There have been some attempts to provide unified methods that bridge and integrate these levels of complexity.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Anderson, Charles H. |author2=Eliasmith, Chris |title=Neural Engineering: Computation, Representation, and Dynamics in Neurobiological Systems (Computational Neuroscience) |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-262-55060-1 }}</ref>

===Cognition, discrimination, and learning===
Computational modeling of higher cognitive functions has only recently{{When|date=February 2016}} begun. Experimental data comes primarily from [[single-unit recording]] in [[primates]].  The [[frontal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]] function as integrators of information from multiple sensory modalities. There are some tentative ideas regarding how simple mutually inhibitory functional circuits in these areas may carry out biologically relevant computation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Machens CK, Romo R, Brody CD |title=Flexible control of mutual inhibition: a neural model of two-interval discrimination |journal=Science |volume=307 |issue=5712 |pages=1121–4 |year=2005 |pmid=15718474 |doi=10.1126/science.1104171 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307.1121M }}</ref>

The [[brain]] seems to be able to discriminate and adapt particularly well in certain contexts. For instance, human beings seem to have an enormous capacity for memorizing and [[face perception|recognizing faces]]. One of the key goals of computational neuroscience is to dissect how biological systems carry out these complex computations efficiently and potentially replicate these processes in building intelligent machines.

The brain's large-scale organizational principles are illuminated by many fields, including biology, psychology, and clinical practice. [[Integrative neuroscience]] attempts to consolidate these observations through unified descriptive models and databases of behavioral measures and recordings. These are the bases for some quantitative modeling of large-scale brain activity.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Robinson PA, Rennie CJ, Rowe DL, O'Connor SC, Gordon E | title=Multiscale brain modelling | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume=360 | issue=1457|pages=1043–1050|year=2005|doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1638 |pmid=16087447 |pmc=1854922 }}</ref>

The Computational Representational Understanding of Mind ([[CRUM]]) is another attempt at modeling human cognition through simulated processes like acquired rule-based systems in decision making and the manipulation of visual representations in decision making.

===Consciousness===
One of the ultimate goals of psychology/neuroscience is to be able to explain the everyday experience of conscious life. [[Francis Crick]] and [[Christof Koch]] made some attempts to formulate a consistent framework for future work in [[neural correlates of consciousness]] (NCC), though much of the work in this field remains speculative.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Crick F, Koch C |title=A framework for consciousness |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=119–26 |year=2003 |pmid=12555104 |doi=10.1038/nn0203-119|url= https://zenodo.org/record/852680 }}</ref>

===Computational clinical neuroscience===
[[Computational Clinical Neuroscience]] is a field that brings together experts in neuroscience, [[neurology]], [[psychiatry]], [[decision sciences]] and computational modeling to quantitatively define and investigate problems in [[neurological disorders|neurological]] and [[mental disorders|psychiatric diseases]], and to train scientists and clinicians that wish to apply these models to diagnosis and treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adaszewski S1, Dukart J, Kherif F, Frackowiak R, Draganski B; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative|title=How early can we predict Alzheimer's disease using computational anatomy?|journal=Neurobiol Aging |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=2815–26 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2013.06.015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Friston KJ, Stephan KE, Montague R, Dolan RJ |title=Computational psychiatry: the brain as a phantastic organ |journal=Lancet Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=148–58 |year=2014 |doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(14)70275-5 }}</ref>
