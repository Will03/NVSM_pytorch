The '''Voynich manuscript''' is an illustrated [[codex]] hand-written in an unknown [[writing system]]. The [[vellum]] on which it is written has been [[carbon-dated]] to the early 15th century (1404–1438), and it may have been composed in [[Italian Renaissance#Northern and Central Italy in the Late Middle Ages|Northern Italy during the Italian Renaissance]].<ref name="ngvideo" /><ref name="physorg" /> The manuscript is named after [[Wilfrid Voynich]], a [[Poles|Polish]]-[[Samogitians|Samogitian]] book dealer who purchased it in 1912.<ref>{{harvnb|Brumbaugh|1978}}</ref>

Some of the pages are missing, with around 240 remaining. The text is written from left to right, and most of the pages have illustrations or diagrams. Some pages are foldable sheets.

The Voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur [[cryptographer]]s, including American and British [[codebreakers]] from both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].<ref name="MH2013">{{cite web |author=Hogenboom, Melissa |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22975809 |title=Mysterious Voynich manuscript has 'genuine message' |website=BBC News |date=June 21, 2013 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> No one has yet demonstrably deciphered the text, and it has become a famous case in the [[history of cryptography]]. The mystery of the meaning and origin of the manuscript has excited the popular imagination, making the manuscript the subject of novels and speculation. None of the many hypotheses proposed over the last hundred years has yet been independently verified.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ciphermysteries.com/the-voynich-manuscript/voynich-theories |title=Voynich theories |author=Pelling, Nick |access-date=June 8, 2016 |website=ciphermysteries.com}}</ref>

== Description ==

=== Codicology ===
The [[codicology]], or physical characteristics of the manuscript, has been studied by researchers. The manuscript measures {{convert|23.5| by |16.2| by |5|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with hundreds of [[vellum parchment|vellum]] pages collected into 18 [[Paper quire|quires]]. The total number of pages is around 240, but the exact number depends on how the manuscript's unusual foldouts are counted.<ref name="MS 408">{{harvnb|Shailor}}</ref> The quires have been numbered from 1 to 20 in various locations, using numerals consistent with the 1400s, and the top righthand corner of each [[recto and verso|recto]] (righthand) page has been numbered from 1 to 116, using numerals of a later date. From the various numbering gaps in the quires and pages, it seems likely that in the past the manuscript had at least 272 pages in 20 quires, some of which were already missing when Wilfrid Voynich acquired the manuscript in 1912. There is strong evidence that many of the book's [[wikt:bifolio|bifolios]] were reordered at various points in its history, and that the original page order may well have been quite different from what it is today.<ref name=analysis>{{harvnb|Barabe|2009}}</ref><ref name="Pelling">{{harvnb|Pelling|2006}}</ref>

=== Parchment, covers, and binding ===
[[Radiocarbon dating]] of samples from various parts of the manuscript was performed at  the [[University of Arizona]] in 2009. The results were consistent for all samples tested and indicated a date for the parchment between 1404 and 1438.<ref name=voynich.nu_origin/> Protein testing in 2014 revealed that the parchment was made from calf skin, and multispectral analysis showed that it was unwritten on before the manuscript was created. The parchment was created with care, but deficiencies exist and the quality is assessed as average, at best.<ref name=voynich.nu_origin>{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=The origin of the Voynich MS |url=http://www.voynich.nu/origin.html#n04 |website=Voynich.nu |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>

Some folios are thicker than the usual parchment thickness, such as folios 42 and 47.<ref name=voynich.nu_carbon>{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=The Radio-Carbon Dating of the Voynich MS |url=http://www.voynich.nu/extra/carbon.html |website=Voynich.nu |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>

The goat skin<ref>{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=About the binding of the MS |url=http://www.voynich.nu/descr.html#cover |website=Voynich.nu |date=May 27, 2016 |access-date=June 9, 2016}}</ref> binding and covers are not original to the book, but date to its possession by the [[Collegio Romano]].<ref name="MS 408"/> Insect holes are present on the first and last folios of the manuscript in the current order and suggest that a wooden cover was present before the later covers, and discolouring on the edges points to a tanned-leather inside cover.<ref name=voynich.nu_origin/>

=== Ink ===
Many pages contain substantial drawings or charts which are colored with paint. Based on modern analysis using [[polarized light microscopy]] (PLM), it has been determined that a [[quill|quill pen]] and [[iron gall ink]] were used for the text and figure outlines; the colored paint was applied (somewhat crudely) to the figures, possibly at a later date. The ink of the drawings, text and page and quire numbers had similar microscopic characteristics. [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS) performed in 2009 revealed that the inks contained major amounts of iron, [[sulfur]], [[potassium]], calcium and carbon and [[trace element|trace amounts]] of copper and occasionally zinc. EDS did not show the presence of lead, while [[X-ray diffraction]] (XRD) identified potassium [[Lead(II,IV) oxide|lead oxide]], potassium hydrogen sulphate and [[syngenite]] in one of the samples tested. The similarity between the drawing inks and text inks suggested a contemporaneous origin.<ref name=analysis/>

=== Paint ===
The blue, clear (or white), red-brown, and green paints of the manuscript have been analyzed using PLM, XRD, EDS, and [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM). The blue paint proved to be ground [[azurite]] with minor traces of the copper oxide [[cuprite]]. The clear paint is likely a mixture of eggwhite and [[calcium carbonate]], while the green paint is tentatively characterized by copper and copper-[[chlorine]] resinate; the crystalline material might be [[atacamite]] or another copper-chlorine compound. Analysis of the red-brown paint indicated a red [[ochre]] with the crystal phases [[hematite]] and iron sulfide. Minor amounts of lead sulfide and [[palmierite]] were possibly present in the red-brown paint.<ref name=analysis/> The pigments were considered inexpensive.<ref name=voynich.nu_origin/>

=== Retouching ===
Computer scientist [[Jorge Stolfi]] of the [[University of Campinas]] highlighted that parts of the text and drawings are modified, using darker ink over a fainter earlier script. Evidence for this is visible in various folios, for example ''f1r'', ''f3v'', ''f26v'', ''f57v'', ''f67r2'', ''f71r'', ''f72v1'', ''f72v3'' and ''f73r''.<ref name=Stolfi>{{cite web |author=Stolfi, Jorge |date=July 22, 2004 |title=Evidence of text retouching on f1r |url=http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/voynich/04-07-15-retouching/ |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>

=== Text ===
[[File:Voynich Manuscript (119).jpg|thumb|200px|Page 119; ''f66r'', showing characteristics of the text]]
[[File:Voynich manuscript recipe example 107r crop.jpg|thumb|200px|Page 191; ''f107r'', text detail]]
Every page in the manuscript contains text, mostly in an unidentified language, but some have extraneous writing in [[Latin script]]. The bulk of the text in the 240-page manuscript is written in an unknown script, running left to right. Most of the characters are composed of one or two simple pen strokes. Some dispute exists as to whether certain characters are distinct, but a script of 20–25 characters would account for virtually all of the text; the exceptions are a few dozen rarer characters that occur only once or twice each. There is no obvious [[punctuation]].<ref name=nsa/>

Much of the text is written in a single column in the body of a page, with a slightly ragged right margin and paragraph divisions and sometimes with stars in the left margin.<ref name="MS 408"/> Other text occurs in charts or as labels associated with illustrations. There are no indications of any errors or corrections made at any place in the document. The [[wikt:ductus|ductus]] flows smoothly, giving the impression that the symbols were not [[cipher|enciphered]]; there is no delay between characters, as would normally be expected in written encoded text.

==== Extraneous writing ====
Only a few of the words in the manuscript are thought to have not been written in the unknown script:<ref name=enigma/>
* ''f1r'': A sequence of Latin letters in the right margin parallel with characters from the unknown script, also the now unreadable signature of "[[Jacobus Sinapius|Jacobj à Tepenece]]" is found in the bottom margin.
* ''f17r'': A line of writing in the Latin script in the top margin
* ''f70v&ndash;f73v'': The astrological series of diagrams in the astronomical section has the names of 10 of the months (from March to December) written in Latin script, with spelling suggestive of the medieval languages of France, northwest Italy, or the [[Iberian Peninsula]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inamidst.com/voynich/months |author=Palmer, Sean B. |year=2004 |title=Voynich Manuscript: Months |website=Inamidst.com |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>
* ''f66r'': A small number of words in the bottom left corner near a drawing of a nude man have been read as "''der musz del''", a High German<ref name=enigma/> phrase for "a widow's share".
* ''f116v'': Four lines written in rather distorted Latin script, except for two words in the unknown script. The words in Latin script appear to be distorted with characteristics of the unknown language. The lettering resembles European alphabets of the late 14th and 15th centuries, but the words do not seem to make sense in any language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inamidst.com/voynich/michitonese |author=Palmer, Sean B. |title=Notes on f116v's Michitonese |website=Inamidst.com |year=2004 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>
Whether these bits of Latin script were part of the original text or were added later is not known.

==== Transcription ====
Various transcription alphabets have been created to equate the Voynich characters with Latin characters to help with cryptanalysis,<ref>{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Text Analysis – Transcription of the Text |url=http://www.voynich.nu/transcr.html |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=March 31, 2018}}</ref> such as the Extensible (originally: European) Voynich Alphabet (EVA).<ref>{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Text Analysis – Transcription of the Text: Eva |url=http://www.voynich.nu/transcr.html#Eva |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=March 31, 2018}}</ref> The first major one was created by the "First Study Group" led by cryptographer [[William F. Friedman]] in the 1940s, where each line of the manuscript was transcribed to an IBM [[punched card|punch card]] to make it [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Text Analysis – Transcription of the Text: FSG |url=http://www.voynich.nu/transcr.html#FSG |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=March 31, 2018}}</ref><ref name=Reeds1994>{{cite web| format=PDF |url=http://www.apprendre-en-ligne.net/crypto/mystere/wff.pdf |title=William F.

[[File:Voynich EVA.svg|thumb|center|800px|European Voynich Alphabet: Capital EVA letters are sometimes used to illustrate different variations of the same symbol.]]

==== Statistical patterns ====
The text consists of over 170,000 characters,<ref name=Schmeh/> with spaces dividing the text into about 35,000 groups of varying length, usually referred to as "words" or "word tokens" (37,919); 8,114 of those words [[Hapax legomenon|are considered unique]] "word types".<ref name=ReddyKnight_p2>{{harvnb|Reddy|Knight|2011|p=2}}</ref> The structure of these words seems to follow [[phonological]] or [[orthography|orthographic]] laws of some sort; for example, certain characters must appear in each word (like English [[vowel]]s), some characters never follow others, or some may be doubled or tripled, but others may not.

The distribution of letters within words is also rather peculiar: Some characters occur only at the beginning of a word, some only at the end, and some always in the middle section.<ref>{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Analysis Section ( 2/5 ) – Character statistics |url=http://www.voynich.nu/a2_char.html |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=March 31, 2018}}</ref> Professor Gonzalo Rubio, an expert in ancient languages at [[Pennsylvania State University]], stated, "the things we know as 'grammatical markers' – things that occur commonly at the beginning or end of words, such as 's' or 'd' in our language, and that are used to express grammar, never appear in the middle of 'words' in the Voynich manuscript. That's unheard of for any Indo-European, Hungarian or Finnish language."<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite web| author=Day, Michael |date=May 24, 2011 |title=The Voynich Manuscript: will we ever be able to read this book? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/8532458/The-Voynich-Manuscript-will-we-ever-be-able-to-read-this-book.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> Many researchers have commented upon the highly regular structure of the words.<ref>{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Analysis Section ( 3/5 ) – Word structure |date=December 26, 2015 |url=http://www.voynich.nu/a3_para.html |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> 

The distribution of letters within the text is also strange. Stephan Vonfelt studied some statistical properties of the distribution of letters and their correlations (properties which can be vaguely characterized as rhythmic resonance, alliteration or assonance) and found that under that respect Voynichese is more similar to Chinese than European languages, although the numerical differences between Voynichese and Chinese look larger than those between Chinese and European languages.<ref>Vonfelt S. (2014), [http://graphometrie.free.fr/publications/Voynich_en.pdf 'The strange resonances of the Voynich manuscript'], Graphométrie.</ref>

Practically no words have fewer than two letters or more than ten.<ref name = "Schmeh">{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_voynich_manuscript_the_book_nobody_can_read |title=The Voynich Manuscript: The Book Nobody Can Read |author=Schmeh, Klaus |date=January–February 2011 |website=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=35.1 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> Some words occur in only certain sections, or in only a few pages; others occur throughout the manuscript. Few repetitions occur among the thousand or so labels attached to the illustrations. There are instances where the same common word appears up to three times in a row<ref name = "Schmeh"/> (see [[Zipf's law]]). Words that differ by only one letter also repeat with unusual frequency, causing single-substitution alphabet decipherings to yield babble-like text. In 1962, [[cryptanalyst]] [[Elizebeth Friedman]] described such attempts as "doomed to utter frustration".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de//dokumente/b/b043178.pdf |author=Friedman, Elizebeth |date=August 5, 1962 |title=The Most Mysterious MS. – Still an Enigma |website=Washington D.C. Post |volume=E1, E5}} – Quoted in Mary D'Imperio's "Elegant Enigma", p.27 (section 4.4)</ref>

=== Illustrations ===
[[File:Voynich manuscript bathtub2 example 78r cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|A detail from the "biological" section of the manuscript]]
[[File:Voynich Manuscript (50) detail ((dragon)).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Detail of page 50, ''f25v''; resembling a dragon]]
[[File:Voynich-86-1006231.jpg|thumb|200px|Detail of page 158, ''f86r6''; the castle]]
The illustrations are conventionally used to divide most of the manuscript into six different sections, since the text itself cannot be read. Each section is typified by illustrations with different styles and supposed subject matter<ref name = "Schmeh" /> except for the last section, in which the only drawings are small stars in the margin. The following are the sections and their conventional names:

* '''Herbal, 112 folios:''' Each page displays one or two plants and a few paragraphs of text, a format typical of European [[herbal]]s of the time. Some parts of these drawings are larger and cleaner copies of sketches seen in the "pharmaceutical" section. None of the plants depicted are unambiguously identifiable.<ref name="MS 408"/><ref name=VIB>{{cite web |author=Schwerdtfeger, Elias |year=2004 |title=Voynich Information Browser |url=http://voynich.freie-literatur.de/index.php?show=overview |access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref>
* '''Astronomical, 21 folios:''' Contains circular diagrams suggestive of [[astronomy]] or [[astrology]], some of them with suns, moons, and stars. One series of 12 diagrams depicts conventional symbols for the [[zodiac]]al constellations (two fish for [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], a bull for [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], a hunter with crossbow for [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], etc.). Each of these has 30 female figures arranged in two or more concentric bands. Most of the females are at least partly nude, and each holds what appears to be a labeled star or is shown with the star attached to either arm by what could be a tether or cord of some kind. The last two pages of this section were lost ([[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] and [[Capricornus]], roughly January and February), while [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] and Taurus are split into four paired diagrams with 15 women and 15 stars each. Some of these diagrams are on fold-out pages.<ref name="MS 408"/><ref name=VIB/>
* '''Biological, 20 folios:''' A dense continuous text interspersed with figures, mostly showing small nude women, some wearing crowns, bathing in pools or tubs connected by an elaborate network of pipes. The bifolio consists of folios 78 (verso) and 81 (recto); it forms an integrated design, with water flowing from one folio to the other.<ref name=voynich.nu_origin/><ref name=VIB/>
* '''Cosmological, 13 folios:''' More circular diagrams, but they are of an obscure nature. This section also has foldouts; one of them spans six pages, commonly called the Rosettes folio, and contains a map or diagram with nine "islands" or "rosettes" connected by "[[causeway]]s" and containing castles, as well as what might be a volcano.<ref name="MS 408"/><ref name=VIB/><ref name=ZandbergenRosettes>{{cite web|author=Zandbergen, René |date=May 17, 2016 |title=Rosettes folio |url=http://www.voynich.nu/q14/index.html#fRos |access-date=June 9, 2016}}</ref>
* '''Pharmaceutical, 34 folios:''' Many labeled drawings of isolated plant parts (roots, leaves, etc.), objects resembling [[apothecary]] jars, ranging in style from the mundane to the fantastical, and a few text paragraphs.<ref name="MS 408"/><ref name=VIB/>
* '''Recipes, 22 folios:''' Full pages of text broken into many short paragraphs, each marked with a star in the left margin.<ref name="MS 408"/><ref name=VIB/>

Five folios contain only text, and at least 28 folios are missing from the manuscript.<ref name=VIB/>

=== Purpose ===
[[File:Voynich Manuscript (66).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Page 66, ''f33v'', has been interpreted to represent a sunflower]]
The overall impression given by the surviving leaves of the manuscript is that it was meant to serve as a [[pharmacopoeia]] or to address topics in [[Medieval medicine|medieval or early modern medicine]]. However, the puzzling details of illustrations have fueled many theories about the book's origin, the contents of its text, and the purpose for which it was intended.<ref name = "Schmeh" />

The first section of the book is almost certainly [[herbal]], but attempts have failed to identify the plants, either with actual specimens or with the stylized drawings of contemporaneous herbals.<ref name="KennedyChurchill2011">{{harvnb|Kennedy|Churchill|2011|pp=12—}}</ref> Only a few of the plant drawings can be identified with reasonable certainty, such as a [[Viola tricolor|wild pansy]] and the [[maidenhair fern]]. The herbal pictures that match pharmacological sketches appear to be clean copies of them, except that missing parts were completed with improbable-looking details. In fact, many of the plant drawings in the herbal section seem to be composite: the roots of one species have been fastened to the leaves of another, with flowers from a third.<ref name="KennedyChurchill2011"/>

Botanist [[Hugh O'Neill (botanist)|Hugh O'Neill]] believed that one illustration depicted a New World [[Helianthus annuus|sunflower]], which would help date the manuscript and open up intriguing possibilities for its origin; unfortunately, the identification is only speculative.<ref name="Schmeh"/>

The basins and tubes in the "biological" section are sometimes interpreted as implying a connection to [[alchemy]], yet they bear little obvious resemblance to the alchemical equipment of the period.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Astrological considerations frequently played a prominent role in herb gathering, [[bloodletting]], and other medical procedures common during the likeliest dates of the manuscript. However, interpretation remains speculative, apart from the obvious [[Zodiac]] symbols and one diagram possibly showing the classical planets.<ref name="Schmeh"/>

The first confirmed owner was [[Georg Baresch]], an obscure [[alchemy|alchemist]] from [[Prague]]. Baresch was apparently just as puzzled as modern scientists about this "[[Sphinx|Sphynx]]" that had been "taking up space uselessly in his library" for many years.<ref name=ZandbergenLetters/> He learned that [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]] from the [[Collegio Romano]] had published a [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ([[Egyptology|Egyptian]]) dictionary and [[Oedipus Aegyptiacus|claimed to have deciphered]] the [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s; Baresch twice sent a sample copy of the script to Kircher in Rome, asking for clues.

Whether Kircher answered the request is not known, but he was apparently interested enough to try to acquire the book, which Baresch refused to yield. Upon Baresch's death, the manuscript passed to his friend [[Jan Marek Marci]] (also known as Johannes Marcus Marci), then [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Charles University]] in Prague.

[[File:Michał Wojnicz c. 1885.png|upright|thumb|[[Wilfrid Voynich]] acquired the manuscript in 1912.]]
No records of the book for the next 200 years have been found, but in all likelihood, it was stored with the rest of Kircher's correspondence in the library of the [[Collegio Romano]] (now the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]).<ref name="Schuster2009"/> It probably remained there until the troops of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] captured the city in 1870 and annexed the [[Papal States]]. The new Italian government decided to confiscate many properties of the Church, including the library of the Collegio.<ref name="Schuster2009" /> Many books of the university's library were hastily transferred to the personal libraries of its faculty just before this happened, according to investigations by Xavier Ceccaldi and others, and those books were exempt from confiscation.<ref name="Schuster2009" /> Kircher's correspondence was among those books, and so, apparently, was the Voynich manuscript, as it still bears the ''[[bookplate|ex libris]]'' of [[Pieter Beckx|Petrus Beckx]], head of the Jesuit order and the university's rector at the time.<ref name="MS 408" /><ref name="Schuster2009" />

Beckx's private library was moved to the [[Villa Mondragone]], [[Frascati]], a large country palace near Rome that had been bought by the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1866 and housed the headquarters of the Jesuits' [[Ghislieri College]].<ref name="Schuster2009"/>

In 1903, the Society of Jesus (Collegio Romano) was short of money and decided to sell some of its holdings discreetly to the [[Vatican Library]]. The sale took place in 1912, but not all of the manuscripts listed for sale ended up going to the Vatican.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archiviopug.org/2016/10/22/the-journey-to-america-of-a-set-of-manuscripts-from-the-collegium-romanum|title=The journey to America of a set of manuscripts from the Collegium Romanum|author=Gregorian Archives|year=2016}}</ref> [[Wilfrid Voynich]] acquired 30 of these manuscripts, among them the one which now bears his name.<ref name="Schuster2009"/> He spent the next seven years attempting to interest scholars in deciphering the script, while he worked to determine the origins of the manuscript.<ref name=nsa/>

In 1930, the manuscript was inherited after Wilfrid's death by his widow [[Ethel Voynich]], author of the novel ''[[The Gadfly]]'' and daughter of mathematician [[George Boole]]. She died in 1960 and left the manuscript to her close friend Anne Nill. In 1961, Nill sold the book to antique book dealer [[Hans P. Kraus]]. Kraus was unable to find a buyer and donated the manuscript to Yale University in 1969, where it was catalogued as "MS 408",<ref name=enigma>{{harvnb|D'Imperio|1978}}</ref> sometimes also referred to as "Beinecke MS 408".<ref name="MS 408"/>

{{Timeline of Voynich manuscript ownership}}

== Authorship hypotheses ==
Many people have been proposed as possible authors of the Voynich manuscript, among them, [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Dee]] or [[Edward Kelley]], [[Giovanni Fontana (engineer)|Giovanni Fontana]], or Voynich himself.

===Early history ===
[[file:AACHEN, Hans von - Portrait of Emperor Rudolf II - WGA.jpg|left|thumb|[[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], portrait by [[Hans von Aachen]].]]
Marci's 1665/1666 cover letter to Kircher says that, according to his friend the late [[Raphael Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky|Raphael Mnishovsky]], the book had once been bought by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Bohemia]]  for 600&nbsp;[[ducat]]s (66.42&nbsp;[[troy ounce]] [[actual gold weight]], or 2.07&nbsp;kg). (Mnishovsky had died in 1644, more than 20&nbsp;years earlier, and the deal must have occurred before Rudolf's abdication in 1611, at least 55&nbsp;years before Marci's letter. However, [[Karl Widemann]] sold books to Rudolf&nbsp;II in March 1599.)

[[File:Roger Bacon in his observatory at Merton College, Oxford. Oi Wellcome M0001840.jpg|200px|right|thumb|alt=Wellcome Library, oil|Ernest Board's portrayal of Bacon in his observatory at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]]]]
According to the letter, Mnishovsky (but not necessarily Rudolf) speculated that the author was 13th century [[Franciscan]] friar and [[polymath]] [[Roger Bacon]].<ref name="Bacon/Mnishovsky">{{cite web |url=http://www.voynichcentral.com/users/philipneal/seventeenthcentury/raphael_sentence.html |title=Philip Neal's analysis of Marci's grammar |website=Voynich Central |access-date=8 June 2016<!-- 17 November 2011 --> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007181002/http://www.voynichcentral.com/users/philipneal/seventeenthcentury/raphael_sentence.html |archivedate=October 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> Marci said that he was suspending judgment about this claim, but it was taken quite seriously by Wilfrid Voynich who did his best to confirm it.<ref name="Schuster2009"/> Voynich contemplated the possibility that the author was [[Albertus Magnus]] if not Roger Bacon.<ref name="Zandbergen solvers"/>

[[File:John Dee Ashmolean.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Mathematician [[John Dee]] may have sold the manuscript to Emperor Rudolf around 1600.]]
The assumption that Bacon was the author led Voynich to conclude that [[John Dee]] sold the manuscript to Rudolf. Dee was a mathematician and astrologer at the court of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] who was known to have owned a large collection of Bacon's manuscripts.

[[File:EdwKelley.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Edward Kelley]] might have created the manuscript as a fraud]]Dee and his ''[[scrying|scrier]]'' ([[spirit medium]]) [[Edward Kelley]] lived in Bohemia for several years, where they had hoped to sell their services to the emperor. However, this sale seems quite unlikely, according to John Schuster, because Dee's meticulously kept diaries do not mention it.<ref name="Schuster2009"/>
If Bacon did not create the Voynich manuscript, a supposed connection to Dee is much weakened. It was thought possible, prior to the carbon dating of the manuscript, that Dee or Kelley might have written it and spread the rumor that it was originally a work of Bacon's in the hopes of later selling it.<ref name=JayWinter_p249>{{harvnb|Winter|2015|p=249}}</ref>

=== Fabrication by Voynich ===
Some suspect Voynich of having fabricated the manuscript himself.<ref name="Originof">{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Origin of the manuscript |website=Voynich.nu |url=http://www.voynich.nu/origin.html |access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref> As an antique book dealer, he probably had the necessary knowledge and means, and a lost book by Roger Bacon would have been worth a fortune. Furthermore, Baresch's letter and Marci's letter only establish the existence of a manuscript, not that the Voynich manuscript is the same one mentioned. These letters could possibly have been the motivation for Voynich to fabricate the manuscript, assuming that he was aware of them. However, many consider the expert internal dating of the manuscript and the June&nbsp;1999<ref name=ZandbergenHistory/> discovery of Baresch's letter to Kircher as having eliminated this possibility.<ref name="Originof"/><ref name="Schuster2009"/>

[[Eamon Duffy]] says that the radiocarbon dating of the parchment (or, more accurately, vellum) "effectively rules out any possibility that the manuscript is a post-medieval forgery", as the consistency of the pages indicates origin from a single source, and "it is inconceivable" that a quantity of unused parchment comprising "at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins" could have survived from the early 15th&nbsp;century.<ref>{{cite journal  |last= Duffy |first=Eamon |title=Secret Knowledge — or a Hoax? |journal=The New York Review of Books |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=44–46 |date=20 April 2017 }}</ref> However, recent forgeries of [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], which are based on 2,000&nbsp;year-old leather as their “slate”, render pure carbon dating insufficient.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/dead-sea-scrolls-scam-dozens-of-recently-sold-fragments-are-fakes-experts-warn/ |title=Dead Sea Scrolls scam: Dozens of recently sold fragments are fakes, experts warn |work=The Times Of Israel |date=3 October 2017}}</ref>

=== Giovanni Fontana ===
[[File:Feuerhexe.jpg|alt=One of Fontana's fantastical illustrations.|thumb|One of Giovanni Fontana's fantastical illustrations, c.&nbsp;1420–1430]]
It has been suggested that some illustrations in the books оf an Italian engineer, [[Giovanni Fontana (engineer)|Giovanni Fontana]], slightly resemble Voynich illustrations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philipneal.net/voynichsources/fontana_cipher_manuscripts|title=The enciphered manuscripts of Giovanni Fontana|author=Philip Neal}}</ref> Fontana was familiar with cryptography and used it in his books, although he didn't use the Voynich script but a simple substitution cipher. In the book ''Secretum de thesauro experimentorum ymaginationis hominum'' (Secret of the treasure-room of experiments in man's imagination), written c.&nbsp;1430, Fontana described [[mnemonic]] machines, written in his cypher.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdOr7qM4-xYC&lpg=PA101&ots=ZTPEsbiM1f&dq=Secretum%20de%20Thesauro&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q=Secretum%20de%20Thesauro&f=false |title=The Gallery of Memory: Literary and Iconographic Models in the Age of the Printing Press |author=Lina Bolzoni |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2001 |ISBN=9780802043306}}</ref> At least ''Bellicorum instrumentorum liber'' and this book used a cryptographic system, described as a simple, rational cipher, based on signs without letters or numbers.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYvjRuLbwRQC&lpg=PT160&ots=3PAllzRgGB&dq=Secretum%20de%20Thesauro&pg=PT160#v=onepage&q=Secretum%20de%20Thesauro&f=false |title=Openness, Secrecy, Authorship: Technical Arts and the Culture of Knowledge from Antiquity to the Renaissance |first=Pamela O. |last=Long |publisher=JHU Press |year=2001 |ISBN=9780801866067}}</ref>

=== Other theories ===
Sometime before 1921, Voynich was able to read a name faintly written at the foot of the manuscript's first page: "Jacobj à Tepenece". This is taken to be a reference to Jakub Hořčický of Tepenec, also known by his Latin name [[Jacobus Sinapius]]. [[Rudolph II]] had ennobled him in 1607, had appointed him his Imperial Distiller, and had made him curator of his botanical gardens as well as one of his personal physicians. Voynich (and many other people after him) concluded that Jacobus owned the Voynich manuscript prior to Baresch, and he drew a link from that to Rudolf's court, in confirmation of Mnishovsky's story.

Jacobus's name is still clearly visible under ultraviolet light; however, it does not match the copy of his signature in a document located by Jan Hurych in 2003.<ref name="ngvideo"/><ref name="Sinapius">{{cite web |url=http://hurontaria.baf.cz/CVM/b12.htm |title=The New Signature of Horczicky and the Comparison of them all |website=Hurontaria.baf.cz |access-date=8 June 2016<!-- 21 August 2008 --> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126223023/http://hurontaria.baf.cz/CVM/b12.htm |archivedate=26 January 2009 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> As a result, it has been suggested that the signature was added later, possibly even fraudulently by Voynich himself.<ref name=ngvideo/> <!-- the following sentence hidden because, without a source, it represents original research or pure speculation: Yet the difference between the two signatures does not necessarily disprove Hořčický's ownership, because the writing on page ''f1r'' might well have been an ownership mark added by a librarian at the time. -->

Baresch's letter bears some resemblance to a hoax that orientalist [[Andreas Müller (orientalist)|Andreas Mueller]] once played on Kircher. Mueller sent some unintelligible text to Kircher with a note explaining that it had come from Egypt, and asking him for a translation. Kircher reportedly solved it.<ref name=Hurych>{{cite web |author=Hurych, Jan B. |date=May 15, 2009 |title=Athanasius Kircher – the VM in Rome |url=http://www.as.up.krakow.pl/jvs/library/16-4-2009-05-17/ |access-date=11 June 2016}}</ref> It has been speculated that these were both cryptographic tricks played on Kircher to make him look foolish.<ref name=Hurych/> <!-- the following has been hidden because, without a source, it represents original research or pure speculation: but the Voynich manuscript is on such a vastly different scale to a few signs in a letter that this seems somewhat out of scale for such an endeavor. -->

[[File:Voynich Manuscript (158).jpg|thumb|Some pages of the manuscript fold out to show larger diagrams.]]
[[Raphael Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky|Raphael Mnishovsky]], the friend of Marci who was the reputed source of Bacon's story, was himself a cryptographer and apparently invented a cipher which he claimed was uncrackable (c.&nbsp;1618).<ref name=Hurych2>{{cite web |author=Hurych, Jan B. |date=20 December 2007 |title=More about Dr. Raphael Mnishowsky |url=http://www.as.up.krakow.pl/jvs/library/10-4-2007-12-20/ |access-date=11 June 2016}}</ref> This has led to the speculation that Mnishovsky might have produced the Voynich manuscript as a practical demonstration of his cipher and made Baresch his unwitting test subject. Indeed, the disclaimer in the Voynich manuscript cover letter could mean that Marci suspected some kind of deception.<ref name=Hurych2/>

In his 2006 book, [[Nick Pelling]] proposed that the Voynich manuscript was written by 15th&nbsp;century North Italian architect [[Filarete|Antonio Averlino]] (also known as "Filarete"), a theory broadly consistent with the radiocarbon dating.<ref name="Pelling"/>

== Language hypotheses ==
Many hypotheses have been developed  about the Voynich manuscript's "language", called ''Voynichese'':

{{Original research section|date=January 2017}}

=== Ciphers ===
[[File:Voynich manuscript excerpt.svg|thumb|The Voynich manuscript is written in an unknown [[writing system|script]].]]
[[File:Vigenère square shading.svg|thumb|The Vigenère square or table has been used for encryption and decryption.]]
According to the "letter-based cipher" theory, the Voynich manuscript contains a meaningful text in some European language that was intentionally rendered obscure by mapping it to the Voynich manuscript "alphabet" through a [[cipher]] of some sort—an [[algorithm]] that operated on individual letters. This was the working hypothesis for most 20th-century deciphering attempts, including an informal team of [[NSA]] [[cryptographer]]s led by [[William F. Friedman]] in the early 1950s.<!--more names? SSG?--><ref name=Reeds1994/>

The main argument for this theory is that it is difficult to explain a European author using a strange alphabet—except as an attempt to hide information. Indeed, even Roger Bacon knew about ciphers, and the estimated date for the manuscript roughly coincides with the birth of [[cryptography]] in Europe as a relatively systematic discipline.{{Citation Needed|date=October 2017}}

The counterargument is that almost all cipher systems consistent with that era fail to match what is seen in the Voynich manuscript. For example, simple [[substitution cipher]]s would be excluded because the distribution of letter frequencies does not resemble that of any known language; while the small number of different letter shapes used implies that [[nomenclator cipher|nomenclator]] and [[homophonic cipher]]s would be ruled out, because these typically employ larger cipher alphabets. [[Polyalphabetic cipher]]s were invented by [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]] in the 1460s and included the later [[Vigenère cipher]], but they usually yield ciphertexts where all cipher shapes occur with roughly equal probability, quite unlike the language-like letter distribution which the Voynich manuscript appears to have.

However, the presence of many tightly grouped shapes in the Voynich manuscript (such as "or", "ar", "ol", "al", "an", "ain", "aiin", "air", "aiir", "am", "ee", "eee", among others) does suggest that its cipher system may make use of a "verbose cipher", where single letters in a plaintext get enciphered into groups of fake letters. For example, the first two lines of page ''f15v'' (seen above) contain "{{not a typo|oror or}}" and "{{not a typo|or or oro r}}", which strongly resemble how Roman numbers such as "CCC" or "XXXX" would look if verbosely enciphered.<ref name=Pelling2009>{{cite web |author=Pelling, Nick |date=August 27, 2009 |title=Voynich cipher structure |url=http://ciphermysteries.com/2009/08/27/voynich-cipher-structure |access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref>

That the encryption system started from a fundamentally simple cipher and then augmented it by adding nulls (meaningless symbols), homophones (duplicate symbols), transposition cipher (letter rearrangement), false word breaks, and more is also entirely possible.

=== Codes ===
"According to the "codebook cipher" theory, the Voynich manuscript "words" would actually be [[code (cryptography)|codes]] to be looked up in a "dictionary" or [[codebook]]. The main evidence for this theory is that the internal structure and length distribution of many words are similar to those of [[Roman numeral]]s, which at the time would be a natural choice for the codes. However, book-based ciphers would be viable for only short messages, because they are very cumbersome to write and to read." {{cn|date=December 2018}}

=== Shorthand ===
In 1943, Joseph Martin Feely claimed that the manuscript was a scientific diary written in shorthand. According to D’Imperio,<ref name=enigma/> this was “Latin, but in a system of abbreviated forms not considered acceptable by other scholars, who unanimously rejected his readings of the text”.

=== Steganography ===
This theory holds that the text of the Voynich manuscript is mostly meaningless, but contains meaningful information hidden in inconspicuous details—e.g., the second letter of every word, or the number of letters in each line. This technique, called [[steganography]], is very old and was described by [[Johannes Trithemius]] in 1499. Though the plain text was speculated to have been extracted by a [[Cardan grille]] (an overlay with cut-outs for the meaningful text) of some sort, this seems somewhat unlikely because the words and letters are not arranged on anything like a regular grid.<!--Why does it need to be regular? Any grid could function for the obviously ingenious writer of this manuscript--> Still, steganographic claims are hard to prove or disprove, since [[stegotext]]s can be arbitrarily hard to find.

It has been suggested that the meaningful text could be encoded in the length or shape of certain pen strokes.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Vogt, Elmar |date=September 22, 2009 |title=An Outline of the Stroke Theory as a Possible Method of Encipherment of the Voynich Manuscript |url=https://voynichthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/stroke.pdf |access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> There are indeed examples of steganography from about that time <!-- Trithemius? --> that use letter shape ([[Emphasis (typography)|italic]] vs. upright) to hide information. However, when examined at high magnification, the Voynich manuscript pen strokes seem quite natural, and substantially affected by the uneven surface of the vellum.{{Citation Needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Natural language ===
Statistical analysis of the text reveals patterns similar to those of [[natural language]]s. For instance, the [[Entropy (information theory)|word entropy]] (about 10 bits per word) is similar to that of English or Latin texts.<ref name="Landini">{{harvnb|Landini|2001|pp=275–295}}</ref> In 2013, Diego Amancio ''et al'' argued that the Voynich manuscript "is mostly compatible with natural languages and incompatible with random texts".<ref name="amancio et al">{{harvnb|Amancio|Altmann|Rybski|Oliveira Jr.|2013}}</ref>

The linguist [[Jacques Guy]] once suggested that the Voynich manuscript text could be some little-known natural language, written [[plaintext|in the plain]] with an invented alphabet. The word structure is similar to that of many language families of East and Central Asia, mainly [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], and [[Burmese language|Burmese]]), [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]], etc.) and possibly [[Tai languages|Tai]] ([[Thai language|Thai]], [[Lao language|Lao]], etc.). In many of these languages, the [[word (linguistics)|words]] have only one [[syllable]]; and syllables have a rather rich structure, including [[tonal language|tonal patterns]].

This theory has some historical plausibility. While those languages generally had native scripts, these were notoriously difficult for Western visitors. This difficulty motivated the invention of several [[phonetic]] scripts, mostly with [[Romanization|Latin letters]], but sometimes with invented alphabets. Although the known examples are much later than the Voynich manuscript, history records hundreds of explorers and missionaries who could have done it—even before [[Marco Polo]]'s 13th-century journey, but especially after [[Vasco da Gama]] sailed the sea route to the Orient in 1499.

[[File:Voynich Manuscript (3).jpg|thumb|The first page includes two large red symbols, which have been compared to a Chinese-style book title.]]
The main argument for this theory is that it is consistent with all statistical properties of the Voynich manuscript text which have been tested so far, including doubled and tripled words (which have been found to occur in Chinese and Vietnamese texts at roughly the same frequency as in the Voynich manuscript). It also explains the apparent lack of numerals and Western syntactic features (such as [[article (grammar)|articles]] and [[Copula (linguistics)|copulas]]), and the general inscrutability of the illustrations. Another possible hint is two large red symbols on the first page, which have been compared to a Chinese-style book title, inverted and badly copied. Also, the apparent division of the year into 360 days (rather than 365 days), in groups of 15 and starting with Pisces, are features of the [[Chinese calendar|Chinese agricultural calendar]] (''jie qi'', 節氣). The main argument against the theory is the fact that no one (including scholars at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] in [[Beijing]]) has been able to find any clear examples of Asian symbolism or Asian science in the illustrations.

In 1976, James R Child of the [[National Security Agency]], a linguist of Indo-European languages, proposed that the manuscript was written in a "hitherto unknown North Germanic dialect".<ref>{{harvnb|Child|1976}}</ref> He identified in the manuscript a "skeletal syntax several elements of which are reminiscent of certain Germanic languages", while the content itself is expressed using "a great deal of obscurity".<ref>{{cite web |author=Child, Jim |year=2007 |title=Again, The Voynich Manuscript |url=http://voynichmanuscript.net/voynichpaper.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616205410/http://voynichmanuscript.net/voynichpaper.pdf |archivedate=June 16, 2009 |website=Web.archive.org |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>

In February 2014, Professor Stephen Bax of the [[University of Bedfordshire]] made public his research into using "bottom up" methodology to understand the manuscript. His method involves looking for and translating [[proper noun]]s, in association with relevant illustrations, in the context of other languages of the same time period. A paper he posted online offers tentative translation of 14 characters and 10 words.<ref>{{cite web |title=600 year old mystery manuscript decoded by University of Bedfordshire professor |url= http://www.beds.ac.uk/news/2014/february/600-year-old-mystery-manuscript-decoded-by-university-of-bedfordshire-professor

In 2014, Arthur O. Tucker and Rexford H. Talbert published a paper claiming a positive identification of 37 plants, six animals, and one mineral referenced in the manuscript to plant drawings in the [[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis]] or Badianus manuscript, a fifteenth century Aztec herbal.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Talbert|2013|pp=70–75}}</ref> Together with the presence of atacamite in the paint, they argue that the plants were from Colonial [[New Spain]] and represented the [[Nahuatl]] language, and date the manuscript to between 1521 (the date of the Conquest) and ''circa'' 1576, in contradiction of radiocarbon dating evidence of the vellum and many other elements of the manuscript. However, the vellum, while creation of it was dated earlier, could just have been stored and used at a later date for manuscript making. The analysis has been criticized by other Voynich manuscript researchers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ciphermysteries.com/2014/01/21/brand-new-new-world-nahuatl-voynich-manuscript-theory |title=A Brand New New World / Nahuatl Voynich Manuscript Theory… |last1=Pelling |first1=Nick |authorlink1= Nick Pelling |date=January 14, 2014 |website=Cipher Mysteries |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> pointing out that—among other things—a skilled forger could construct plants that have a passing resemblance to theretofore undiscovered existing plants.<ref>{{harvnb|Grossman|2014}}</ref>

In 2014, a team led by Dr. Diego Amancio of the [[University of São Paulo]]'s Institute of Mathematical and Computer Sciences published a paper detailing a study using statistical methods to analyse the relationships of the words in the text. Instead of trying to find the meaning, Amancio's team used complex network modelling to look for connections and clusters of words.  By employing concepts such as frequency and intermittence, which measure occurrence and concentration of a term in the text, Amancio was able to discover the manuscript's keywords and create three-dimensional models of the text's structure and word frequencies. Their conclusion was that in 90% of cases, the Voynich systems are similar to those of other known books such as the Bible, indicating that the book is an actual piece of text in an actual language, and not well-planned gibberish.<ref name="amancio et al" />

{{quote|The use of the framework was exemplified with the analysis of the Voynich manuscript, with the final conclusion that it differs from a random sequence of words, being compatible with natural languages. Even though our approach is not aimed at deciphering Voynich, it was capable of providing keywords that could be helpful for decipherers in the future.<ref name="amancio et al" />}}

===Constructed language===
{{See also|Philosophical language}}
The peculiar internal structure of Voynich manuscript words led [[William F. Friedman]] to conjecture that the text could be a [[constructed language]]. In 1950, Friedman asked the British army officer [[John Tiltman]] to analyze a few pages of the text, but Tiltman did not share this conclusion. In a paper in 1967, Brigadier Tiltman said: 
{{quote|After reading my report, Mr. Friedman disclosed to me his belief that the basis of the script was a very primitive form of synthetic [[universal language]] such as was developed in the form of a philosophical classification of ideas by [[John Wilkins|Bishop Wilkins]] in 1667 and [[George Dalgarno|Dalgarno]] a little later. It was clear that the productions of these two men were much too systematic, and anything of the kind would have been almost instantly recognisable. My analysis seemed to me to reveal a cumbersome mixture of different kinds of substitution.<ref name=nsa>{{harvnb|Tiltman|1967}}</ref>}}

The concept of a constructed language is quite old, as attested by [[John Wilkins]]'s ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|Philosophical Language]]'' (1668), but still postdates the generally accepted origin of the Voynich manuscript by two centuries. In most known examples, categories are subdivided by adding [[suffix]]es; as a consequence, a text in a particular subject would have many words with similar prefixes—for example, all plant names would begin with similar letters, and likewise for all diseases, etc. This feature could then explain the repetitious nature of the Voynich text. However, no one has been able yet to assign a plausible meaning to any prefix or suffix in the Voynich manuscript.<ref name="plan">{{harvnb|Kahn|1967|pp=870–871}}</ref>

=== Hoax ===
[[File:Voynich Manuscript (175).jpg|thumb|200px|Page 175; ''f99r'', of the "pharmaceutical" section]]
[[File:Voynich Manuscript (135).jpg|thumb|200px|Page 135; ''f75r'', from the biological section showing "[[nymphs]]"]]
The unusual features of the Voynich manuscript text (such as the doubled and tripled words), and the suspicious contents of its illustrations support the idea that the manuscript is a [[hoax]]. In other words, if no one is able to extract meaning from the book, then perhaps this is because the document contains no meaningful content in the first place. Various hoax theories have been proposed over time.

In 2003, computer scientist [[Gordon Rugg]] showed that text with characteristics similar to the Voynich manuscript could have been produced using a table of word prefixes, stems, and suffixes, which would have been selected and combined by means of a perforated paper overlay.<ref>{{cite web | title=Replicating the Voynich Manuscript |publisher=Keele |location=UK |url=http://www.scm.keele.ac.uk/staff/g_rugg/voynich/ |author=Gordon Rugg |access-date=June 8, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/25/arts.highereducation |title= Secret of historic code: it's gibberish |location=UK |author=McKie, Robin |date=January 25, 2004 |website=The Observer |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> The latter device, known as a [[Cardan grille]], was invented around 1550 as an encryption tool, more than 100 years after the estimated creation date of the Voynich manuscript. Some maintain that the similarity between the pseudo-texts generated in Gordon Rugg's experiments and the Voynich manuscript is superficial, and the grille method could be used to emulate any language to a certain degree.<ref>{{cite web |author=D'Agnese, Joseph |url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/12.09/rugg.html?pg=1 |title=Scientific Method Man |website=Wired |date=September 2004 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>

In April 2007, a study by Austrian researcher Andreas Schinner published in ''[[Cryptologia]]'' supported the hoax hypothesis.<ref name="Schinner">{{harvnb|Schinner|2007|pp=95–107}}</ref> Schinner showed that the statistical properties of the manuscript's text were more consistent with meaningless gibberish produced using a quasi-[[stochastic]] method such as the one described by Rugg, than with Latin and medieval German texts.<ref name=Schinner/>

Some scholars have claimed that the manuscript's text appears too sophisticated to be a hoax. In 2013 Marcelo Montemurro, a theoretical physicist from the [[University of Manchester]], published findings claiming that semantic networks exist in the text of the manuscript, such as content-bearing words occurring in a clustered pattern, or new words being used when there was a shift in topic.<ref>{{harvnb|Montemurro|Zanette|2013|p=e66344}}</ref> With this evidence, he believes it unlikely that these features were intentionally "incorporated" into the text to make a hoax more realistic, as most of the required academic knowledge of these structures did not exist at the time the Voynich manuscript would have been written.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hogenboom, Melissa |title=Mysterious Voynich manuscript has 'genuine message' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22975809 |website=BBC News |date=June 22, 2013 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>

In September 2016, Gordon Rugg and Gavin Taylor addressed these objections in another article in ''[[Cryptologia]]'', and illustrated a simple hoax method that they claim could have caused the mathematical properties of the text.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gordon Rugg, Gavin Taylor|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01611194.2016.1206753|title=Hoaxing statistical features of the Voynich Manuscript|publisher=Taylor and Francis Online|date=September 2016|access-date=September 14, 2016|doi=10.1080/01611194.2016.1206753|journal=Cryptologia|pages=1–22}}</ref>

=== Glossolalia ===
[[File:Litterae ignotae.png|thumb|right|200px|Script invented by Hildegard von Bingen]]
[[File:Voynich-partof f78r.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Detail of the "nymphs" on page 141; ''f78r'']]
In their 2004 book, Gerry Kennedy and Rob Churchill suggest the possibility that the Voynich manuscript may be a case of [[glossolalia]] (speaking-in-tongues), [[Mediumship|channeling]], or [[outsider art]].<ref name=KennedyChurchill2004>{{harvnb|Kennedy|Churchill|2004|pp=}}</ref> If so, the author felt compelled to write large amounts of text in a manner which resembles [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]], either because of voices heard or because of an urge. This often takes place in an invented language in glossolalia, usually made up of fragments of the author's own language, although invented scripts for this purpose are rare.

Kennedy and Churchill use [[Hildegard von Bingen]]'s works to point out similarities between the Voynich manuscript and the illustrations that she drew when she was suffering from severe bouts of [[migraine]], which can induce a trance-like state prone to glossolalia. Prominent features found in both are abundant "streams of stars", and the repetitive nature of the "[[nymphs]]" in the biological section.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|Churchill|2004}}</ref> This theory has been found unlikely by other researchers.<ref name=PellingWeb>{{cite web |author=Pelling, Nick |date=January 19, 2012 |title=Does the "Voynich = migraine" theory make your head hurt too? |url=http://ciphermysteries.com/2012/01/19/does-the-voynich-migraine-theory-make-your-head-hurt-too |access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref>

The theory is virtually impossible to prove or disprove, short of deciphering the text. Kennedy and Churchill are themselves not convinced of the hypothesis, but consider it plausible. In the culminating chapter of their work, Kennedy states his belief that it is a hoax or forgery. Churchill acknowledges the possibility that the manuscript is a synthetic forgotten language (as advanced by Friedman) or a forgery as preeminent theories. However, he concludes that, if the manuscript is genuine, mental illness or delusion seems to have affected the author.<ref name="KennedyChurchill2004"/>

== Decipherment claims ==
Since the manuscript's modern rediscovery in 1912, there have been a number of claimed decipherings.

=== William Romaine Newbold ===
One of the earliest efforts to unlock the book's secrets (and the first of many premature claims of decipherment) was made in 1921 by [[William Romaine Newbold]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. His singular hypothesis held that the visible text is meaningless itself, but that each apparent "letter" is in fact constructed of a series of tiny markings discernible only under [[magnification]]. These markings were supposed to be based on [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[shorthand]], forming a second level of script that held the real content of the writing. Newbold claimed to have used this knowledge to work out entire paragraphs proving the authorship of Bacon and recording his use of a [[compound microscope]] four hundred years before [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|van Leeuwenhoek]]. A circular drawing in the "astronomical" section depicts an irregularly shaped object with four curved arms, which Newbold interpreted as a picture of a galaxy, which could be obtained only with a [[telescope]].<ref name=nsa/> Similarly, he interpreted other drawings as [[cell (biology)|cells]] seen through a [[microscope]].

However, Newbold's analysis has since been dismissed as overly speculative<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1800s/newbold_wm_romaine.html |title=Penn Biographies – William Romaine Newbold (1865{{ndash}}1926) |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |date=September 6, 1926 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> after [[John Matthews Manly]] of the [[University of Chicago]] pointed out serious flaws in his theory. Each shorthand character was assumed to have multiple interpretations, with no reliable way to determine which was intended for any given case. Newbold's method also required rearranging letters at will until intelligible [[Latin language|Latin]] was produced. These factors alone ensure the system enough flexibility that nearly anything at all could be discerned from the [[microscopic]] markings. Although evidence of [[micrography]] using the [[Hebrew language]] can be traced as far back as the ninth century, it is nowhere near as compact or complex as the shapes Newbold made out. Close study of the manuscript revealed the markings to be artefacts caused by the way ink cracks as it dries on rough vellum. Perceiving significance in these artefacts can be attributed to [[pareidolia]]. Thanks to Manly's thorough refutation, the micrography theory is now generally disregarded.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kahn|1967|pp=867–869}}</ref>

=== Joseph Martin Feely ===
In 1943, Joseph Martin Feely published ''Roger Bacon's Cipher: The Right Key Found'', in which he claimed that the book was a scientific diary written by Roger Bacon. Feely's method posited that the text was a highly abbreviated medieval Latin written in a simple substitution cipher.<ref name=enigma/>

=== Leonell C Strong ===
[[Leonell C. Strong]], a cancer research scientist and amateur cryptographer, believed that the solution to the Voynich manuscript was a "peculiar double system of arithmetical progressions of a multiple alphabet". Strong claimed that the [[plaintext]] revealed the Voynich manuscript to be written by the 16th-century English author [[Anthony Ascham (author)|Anthony Ascham]], whose works include ''A Little Herbal'', published in 1550. Notes released after his{{Who|date=January 2019}} death reveal that the last stages of his analysis, in which he selected words to combine into phrases, was questionably subjective.<ref>{{harvnb|Winter|2015|p=252}}</ref>

=== Robert S Brumbaugh ===
In 1978, Robert Brumbaugh, a professor of medieval philosophy at Yale University, claimed that the manuscript was a forgery intended to fool Emperor Rudolf II into purchasing it, and that the text is Latin enciphered with a complex, two-step method.<ref name=enigma/>

=== John Stojko ===
In 1978, John Stojko published ''Letters to God's Eye''<ref>{{harvnb|Stojko|1978}}</ref> in which he claimed that the Voynich Manuscript was a series of letters written in vowelless Ukrainian.<ref name="Zandbergen solvers">{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Voynich MS – History of research of the MS |url=http://www.voynich.nu/solvers.html |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> The theory caused some sensation among Ukrainian diaspora at the time, and then in independent Ukraine after 1991.<ref>Олена Русина.

=== Leo Levitov ===
Leo Levitov proposed in his 1987 book, ''Solution of the Voynich Manuscript: A Liturgical Manual for the Endura Rite of the Cathari Heresy, the Cult of Isis'',<ref>{{harvnb|Levitov|1987|pp=}}</ref> that the manuscript is a handbook for the [[Catharism|Cathar]] rite of ''Endura'' written in a [[Flemish]] based [[creole language|creole]]. He further claimed that Catharism was descended from the cult of [[Isis]].<ref name=Stallings>{{cite web |author=Stallings, Dennis |title=Catharism, Levitov, and the Voynich Manuscript |url=http://ixoloxi.com/voynich/levitov2.htm |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>

However, Levitov's decipherment has been refuted on several grounds, not least of which is its being unhistorical. Levitov had a poor grasp on the history of the Cathars, and his depiction of ''Endura'' as an elaborate suicide ritual is at odds with surviving documents describing it as a fast.<ref name=Stallings/> Likewise, there is no known link between Catharism and Isis.

=== Stephen Bax ===
In 2014, applied linguistics Professor Stephen Bax published an article in conjunction with the Swedish-Australian linguist Shaun R. L. King<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stephenbax.net/?p=338 |title=Voynich f6v: Ricinus communis, the Castor Oil plant? |author1=Bax, Stephen |author2=King, Shaun R. L. |website=stephenbax.net |access-date=21 December 2018}}</ref>, in which they claimed to have translated ten words from the manuscript using techniques similar to those used to successfully translate [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. They claimed the manuscript to be a treatise on nature, in a Near Eastern or Asian language, but no full translation was made before his death in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-26198471|title=Breakthrough over 600-year-old mystery manuscript|last=Rigby|first=Nic|date=18 February 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref>

=== Nicholas Gibbs ===
In September 2017, television writer Nicholas Gibbs claimed to have decoded the manuscript as idiosyncratically abbreviated Latin.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/voynich-manuscript-solution/ |title=Voynich manuscript: the solution |date=September 5, 2017 |first=Nicholas |last=Gibbs |website=The Times Literary Supplement |access-date=September 10, 2017}}</ref> He claims the manuscript to be a mostly plagiarized guide to women's health.

Medieval scholars judged Gibbs' hypothesis to be not novel. Gibbs' work was criticized as patching together already-existing scholarship and providing a highly speculative and incorrect translation; Lisa Fagin Davis, director of the [[Medieval Academy of America]], stated that Gibbs' decipherment "doesn’t result in Latin that makes sense."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/experts-are-extremely-dubious-about-the-voynich-solution/ |title=So much for that Voynich manuscript "solution" |date=September 10, 2017 |first=Annalee |last=Newitz |work=Ars Technica |access-date=September 12, 2017 |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/09/has-the-voynich-manuscript-really-been-solved/539310/ |title=Has a Mysterious Medieval Code Really Been Solved? |date=September 10, 2017 |last=Zhang |first=Sarah |work=The Atlantic |access-date=September 12, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Professor Greg Kondrak, a natural language processing expert of the [[University of Alberta]], together with his graduate student Bradley Hauer, used [[artificial intelligence]] in an attempt to decode the manuscript.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/artificial-intelligence-takes-crack-mysterious-voynich-manuscript-180967983/|title=Artificial Intelligence Takes a Crack at Decoding the Mysterious Voynich Manuscript|work=[[Smithsonian Mag]]|date=2018-01-31}}</ref> Their findings were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in 2017, in the form of an article suggesting that the language of the manuscript is most likely [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but encoded using alphagrams, i.e. alphabetically ordered [[anagrams]].

Many books and articles have been written about the manuscript. Copies of the manuscript pages were made by alchemist Georgius Barschius in 1637 and sent to Athanasius Kircher, and later by Wilfrid Voynich.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Clemens|editor1-first=Raymond|title=The Voynich Manuscript|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300217230}}</ref> 

In 2004, the [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] made high-resolution digital scans publicly available online, and several printed facsimiles appeared.
