In the [[United Kingdom]], a '''territorial designation''' follows modern peerage titles, linking them to a specific place or places. It is also an integral part of all [[baronet]]cies.  Within Scotland, a territorial designation proclaims a relationship with a particular area of land.<ref name="Guidance">{{cite web| url=http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/616.html| title=Guidance regarding Baronial Additaments and Territorial Designations| publisher=Court of the Lord Lyon| accessdate=2011-05-22}}</ref>

==Peerages and baronetcies==
A territorial designation is an aspect of the creation of modern [[peerage]]s that links them to a specific place or places, at least one of which is almost always in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is given in the [[letters patent|patent]] of creation after the actual peerage title itself, of which it is not a part. It is also an integral part of all [[baronet]]cies{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}.

For instance, the [[life peerage]]s conferred on the former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministers]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[James Callaghan]] were created as ''Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire'' and ''Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, of the City of Cardiff in the County of South Glamorgan''. The part of the peerage before the [[comma]] is the actual title, and the part after the comma is the territorial designation. These peers should be referred to as ''The Baroness Thatcher'' and ''The Lord Callaghan of Cardiff'': it is incorrect both to use part of the territorial designation as part of the title and to leave out part of the actual title; thus ''The Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven'' and ''The Lord Callaghan'' are incorrect, although the latter may be used informally.

Some territorial designations name more than one place, and the format used depends on whether such places are in the same [[Counties of England|county]] or other administrative division. For instance, the life peerages conferred on [[Margaret McDonagh, Baroness McDonagh|Margaret McDonagh]] and [[John Morris, Baron Morris of Aberavon|John Morris]] were created as ''Baroness McDonagh, of Mitcham and of Morden in the London Borough of Merton'' and ''Baron Morris of Aberavon, of Aberavon in the County of West Glamorgan and of Ceredigion in the County of Dyfed''. Occasionally, a place outside the United Kingdom can be named: for instance, the life peerage conferred on [[Howard Walter Florey|Howard Florey]] was created as ''Baron Florey, of Adelaide in the Commonwealth of Australia and of Marston in the County of Oxford'', or the life peerage conferred on [[Sue Ryder]] was created as ''Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, of Warsaw in Poland and of Cavendish in the County of Suffolk''.

With the exception of Royal peerages, which are often created without them, territorial designations are used with the creation of almost all [[baron]]ies and [[viscount]]cies. Higher ranks of the peerage often used to have them as well, but now rarely do. With the higher ranks, the format could be the same as with lower ranks or it could simply specify the location of the place named in the actual title. For example: ''[[Duke of Wellington (title)|Duke of Wellington]], in the County of Somerset'' (1814) and ''[[Duke of Gordon]], of Gordon Castle in Scotland'' (1876) but ''[[Duke of Fife]]'' (1899); ''[[Marquess of Cholmondeley]], in the County Palatine of Chester'' (1815) and ''[[Marquess of Ailsa]], of the Isle of Ailsa in the County of Ayr'' (1831) but ''[[Marquess of Zetland]]'' (1892); ''[[Earl of Craven]], in the County of York'' (1801) and ''[[Earl Nelson]], of Trafalgar and of Merton in the County of Surrey'' (1805) but ''[[Earl of Stockton]]'' (1984).

In the 19th century, it was possible to create a different peerage title merely by altering the location of the comma. Thus the title ''[[Baron Stanley of Alderley]], in the County of Chester'' differs in format from ''[[Earl of Derby|Baron Stanley]], of Bickerstaffe in the County Palatine of Lancaster'' only by the placement of the comma: the former title is ''Baron Stanley of Alderley'' whilst the latter is ''Baron Stanley''. This format is no longer used: if a peerage title in the format "Baron X of Y" is wanted, the full territorial designation must be used. Thus if the Barony of Stanley of Alderley were created today, it would have to be ''Baron Stanley of Alderley, of Alderley in the County of Chester''. This dual usage of the same term in the title and in the territorial designation may appear peculiar, but it does occasionally occur; an example would be [[Adair Turner]], who was created ''Baron Turner of Ecchinswell, of Ecchinswell in the County of Hampshire''.

In the case of a [[victory title]], at least one term usually refers to the site of the grantee's triumph, usually outside the UK. For example, the famous admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] was created ''Viscount Nelson, of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk'', the Nile being the site of his victory against the French in the [[Battle of the Nile]], and Burnham Thorpe being his place of birth.

==Scotland==

Recognition of a Territorial Designation may also be granted in Scotland by the [[Lord Lyon]] to Scottish [[armiger]]s who own (or were born in or were associated with) named land, generally outwith a town (i.e. rural). The [[Lord Lyon]] advises that for a territorial designation to be recognised, there must be 'ownership of a substantial area of land to which a well-attested name attaches, that is to say, ownership of an “estate”, or farm or, at the very least, a house with policies extending to five acres or thereby'.<ref name="Guidance"/>  The Territorial Designation in this case is considered to be an indivisible part of the name, though not necessarily an indicator of ancestral or feudal nobility, though recognition of a territorial designation is usually accorded alongside the grant or matriculation of a [[Scottish heraldry|Coat of Arms]], which confers minor nobility status.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Adam, F.  |author2=Innes of Learney, T. |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1952| edition=4th| title=The Clans, Septs, and Regiments of the Scottish Highlands| place=Edinburgh & London| publisher=W. & A.K.
