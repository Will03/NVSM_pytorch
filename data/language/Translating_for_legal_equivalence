'''Translating for legal equivalence''' is the production of [[translation]]s that are acceptable by a legal [[jurisdiction]].

==Legal requirements==
For legal and official purposes, [[evidence (law)|evidentiary documents]] and other official [[documentation]] are usually required in the [[official language]](s) of a [[jurisdiction]].

In some [[countries]], it is a requirement for translations of such documents that a [[translator]] swear an [[oath]] to attest that it is the legal equivalent of the [[source text]]. Often, only translators of a special class are authorized to swear such oaths. In some cases, the translation is only accepted as a legal equivalent if it is accompanied by the original or a sworn or certified [[copying|copy]] of it.

Even if a [[translator]] specializes in legal translation or is a [[lawyer]] in their country, this does not necessarily make them a sworn translator. The procedure for translating to legal equivalence differs from country to country.

===Argentina===
In compliance with Law #20,305, all public documents (including personal papers and some commercial contracts) have to be translated and signed by a certified "public translator" (''traductor público''), whose seal and signature have to be legalized on each document by the Translators' professional body of their jurisdiction. All private persons, companies, the judiciary and other government departments are subject to this law regarding documents or depositions in a foreign language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traductores.org.ar/nuevo_org/home/ley/?id_ruta=1&nivel2=8&nivel3=9 |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001142704/http://www.traductores.org.ar/nuevo_org/home/ley/?id_ruta=1&nivel2=8&nivel3=9 |archivedate=October 1, 2009 }}</ref> In order to be certified as a public translator for a major European language, candidates have to attend university courses leading to the professional degree of ''traductor público''.

===Belgium===
"''Sworn Translators''" (singular [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: beëdigd vertaler, [[French language|French]]: traducteur assermenté) or "''Sworn Interpreter''" (singular [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: beëdigd tolk, [[French language|French]]: interprète assermenté) swear an oath before the President of the [[Court of First Instance (Belgium)|Court of First Instance]] of the [[Arrondissements of Belgium|judicial district]] in which they have their place of residence. In the past translators and interpreters in all judicial districts aspiring to "sworn" status were screened for suitability by the [[Prosecutor|Crown Prosecutor]]. The candidate has to state the language combinations for he or she wishes to be sworn. A diploma of translator/interpreter is usually regarded as adequate proof of competence. There is no limitation on the language combinations which can be recognized. 

However, following a scandal involving an illegal immigrant who obtained sworn translator status, The President of the Court of First Instance at [[Antwerp]], launched an experimental scheme whereby aspiring sworn translators and interpreters have to undergo training organized by the [[Ministry of Justice]] and submit to examination. The same President, based on his interpretation of the [[Language legislation in Belgium|language laws]], also ruled that the only language combinations that could be recognized for sworn translator/interpreter status were those in which Dutch was either the original language or the target language. This view has not yet been adopted by other judicial districts in Belgium.

===Brazil===
Official documents can only be translated by Public Sworn Translators and Interpreters, who are certified and accredited by the registry of commerce of each state. The applicants must pass highly demanding oral and written examinations for specific language pairs. They undergo background checks before receiving a registration number, which must be informed in the heading of every translation. 
''Ad hoc'' (temporary) translators can also be appointed by the Registry of Commerce to do a single translation job, when there is no Public Translator registered for that specific language pair.
The registry of commerce of each state also sets the translation fees. 

Although the public sworn translator/interpreter must reside in the state of registration, his translations are valid in the entire country. Institutions and government agencies in cities and states different from those of residence of the public sworn translator may require the notarial verification of the translator's signature. 

Foreign documents must be verified by a Brazilian consulate or embassy in the country they were issued before translation. Official documents translated into a foreign language need to have the public sworn translator's signature verified by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs if the institution or government agency of the foreign country so requires.<ref>{{cite web|title=Buscar tradutor por cidade|url=http://atpmg.com.br/informacoes.php|publisher=www.atpmg.com.br|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>

=== Canada ===
Official translation of documents can be produced in one of two ways. Certified translations are those completed by a certified translator and accompanied by the translator's declaration, signature and seal. The title of "certified translator" is a protected title in Canada, and only those individuals who are members in good standing of a provincial translators' association and have passed a certification exam can use this title and produce certified translations. An alternative method for producing official translations in Canada is by attaching a sworn affidavit signed by the translator in the presence of a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits to the translation.

===Germany===
German regional courts (''Landgerichte'') have the power to appoint "sworn translators". The specific title and the appointment procedure are different in each [[States of Germany|state]]. In most cases, the candidates are required to pass an examination.
