[[File:Wave model Schmidt.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram based on the Wave model originally presented by Johannes Schmidt. In this [[Euler diagram]], the circles are to be regarded as diachronic; that is, they increase in diameter over time, like the concentric waves on a water surface struck by a stone. The background represents a [[dialect continuum]] of no language boundaries. The circles are stable dialects, characters or bundles of characters that have been innovated and have become more stable over an originally small portion of the continuum for socio-political reasons. These circles spread from their small centers of maximum effectiveness like waves, becoming less effective{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and then dissipating at maximum time and distance from the center. Languages are to be regarded as impermanent sets of speech habits that result from and prevail in the intersections of the circles. The most conservative language is represented by the area not covered by the circles.]]
In [[historical linguistics]], the '''wave model''' or '''wave theory''' ([[German language|German]] ''Wellentheorie'') is a model of language change in which a new language feature (innovation) or a new combination of language features spreads from its region of origin, affecting a gradually expanding cluster of dialects. The theory was intended as a substitute for the [[tree model]], which did not seem to be able to explain the existence of some features, especially in the [[Germanic languages]], by descent from a [[proto-language]]. At its most ambitious, it is a wholesale replacement for the tree model of languages.<ref name="francois"/> During the 20th century, the wave model has had little acceptance as a model for language change overall, except for certain cases, such as the study of [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]] and [[areal feature|areal]] phenomena; it has recently gained more popularity among historical linguists, due to the shortcomings of the Tree model.<ref name="francois"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Heggarty|first1=Paul|last2=Maguire|first2=Warren|last3=McMahon|first3=April|title=Splits or waves?

==Principles==
The tree model requires languages to evolve exclusively through social splitting and linguistic divergence. In the “tree” scenario, the adoption of certain innovations by a group of dialects should result immediately in their loss of contact with other related dialects: this is the only way to explain the nested organisation of subgroups imposed by the tree structure.

Such a requirement is absent from the Wave Model, which can easily accommodate a distribution of innovations in intersected patterns. Such a configuration is typical of [[Dialect continuum|dialect continua]] (and of [[Linkage (linguistics)|linkages]], see below), that is, historical situations in which dialects share innovations with different neighbours simultaneously, in such a way that the genealogical subgroups they define form an intersected pattern. This explains the popularity of the Wave model in studies of [[dialectology]].

[[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]] used a second metaphor to explain the formation of a language from a continuum. The continuum is at first like a smooth, sloping line. Speakers in close proximity tend to unify their speech, creating a stepped line out of the sloped line. These steps are the dialects. Over the course of time, some steps become weak and [[Extinct language|fall into disuse]], while others preempt the entire continuum. As example Schmidt used [[Standard German]], which was defined to conform to some dialects and then spread throughout Germany, replacing the local dialects in many cases.

==Legacy==
In modern linguistics, the wave model has contributed greatly to improve, but not supersede, the [[tree model]] approach of the [[comparative method]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1353/lan.2007.0082|last=Labov|first=William|authorlink=William Labov|year=2007|title=Transmission and diffusion|journal=Language|volume=83|pages=344–387}}</ref> Some scholars have even proposed that the wave model does not complement the tree model but should replace it for the representation of language genealogy.<ref name="francois">{{Citation

==History==
Advocacy of the wave theory is attributed to [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]] and [[Hugo Schuchardt]].
<!--, 1872. ''Die Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse der indogermanischen Sprachen''. Weimar: H. Böhlau.-->
<!--According to the model, this should lead to convergence among dissimilar languages.-->
<!--and laid the foundations of modern [[sociolinguistics]]-->

In 2002 to 2007, [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] and his colleagues theorized that [[Oceanic languages]] can be best understood as developing through the wave model.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lynch | first = John | authorlink = John Lynch (linguist) | author2 = [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]]; [[Terry Crowley (linguist)|Terry Crowley]] | year = 2002 | title = The Oceanic languages | location = Richmond, Surrey | publisher = Curzon | isbn = 978-0-7007-1128-4 | oclc = 48929366 }}
