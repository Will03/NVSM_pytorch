'''Engineered languages''' (often abbreviated to '''engelangs''', or, less commonly, '''engilangs''') are [[constructed languages]] devised to test or prove some hypotheses about how languages work or might work.  There are at least three subcategories, [[philosophical languages]] (or ideal languages), logical languages (sometimes abbreviated as ''loglangs''), and experimental languages.  Raymond Brown describes engineered languages as "languages that are designed to specified ''objective'' criteria, and modeled to meet those criteria".<ref>http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html</ref>

Some engineered languages have been considered candidate global [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary language]]s, and some languages intended as international auxiliary languages have certain "engineered" aspects (in which they are more regular and systematic than their natural language sources).

{{further|Knowledge representation}}

Logical languages are meant to allow (or enforce) unambiguous statements.  They are typically based on [[predicate logic]] but can also be based on any system of formal [[logic]].  The two best-known logical languages are the predicate languages [[Loglan]] and its successor [[Lojban]]. They both aim to eliminate syntactical ambiguity and reduce semantic ambiguity to a minimum.  In particular, the [[lojban grammar|grammar of Lojban]] is carefully engineered to express such predicate logic in an unambiguous manner.

== Philosophical languages ==
{{main|Philosophical language}}
Philosophical languages are designed to reflect some aspect of philosophy, particularly with respect to the nature or potential of any given language. [[John Wilkins]]' [[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|Real Character]] and Edward Powell Foster's [[Ro (language)|Ro]] constructed their words using a taxonomic tree. Vocabularies of [[oligosynthetic]] languages, for example [http://www.ygyde.neostrada.pl/index.htm Ygyde], are made of  [[compound word]]s, which are coined from a small (theoretically minimal) set of [[morpheme]]s. [[Suzette Haden Elgin]]'s [[Láadan]] is designed to lexicalize and grammaticalize the concepts and distinctions important to women, based on [[muted group theory]]. [[Sonja Elen Kisa]]'s [[Toki Pona]] is based on [[minimalism|minimalistic]] [[voluntary simplicity|simplicity]], incorporating elements of [[Taoism]].

== Experimental languages ==

{{main|Experimental languages}}

An experimental language is a [[constructed language]] designed for the purpose of exploring some element in the theory of [[linguistics]].  Most such languages are concerned with the relation between [[language and thought]]; however, languages have been constructed to explore other aspects of language as well. In [[science fiction]], much work has been done on the assumption popularly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].
