'''Alien languages''', refers to languages of [[extraterrestrial being]]s, are a hypothetical subject since none have been encountered so far.  The research in these hypothetical languages is variously called  '''exolinguistics''', '''xenolinguistics'''<ref>An early use of the term "xenolinguistics" in [[science fiction]] occurred in 1986, in the novel "Triad" by [[Sheila Finch]] ({{Cite book|title = Triad|last = Finch|first = Sheila|publisher = Spectra|year = 1986|isbn = 9780553257922 |location = New York}} New edition: {{Cite book|title = Triad |last = Finch|first = Sheila|publisher = [[Wildside Press]]|year = 2012|isbn = 9781434447913 |location = Rockville, Maryland}}.</ref> or '''astrolinguistics'''.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.

[[Noam Chomsky]] (1983), basing on his theory of the existence of a [[genetics|genetically-predetermined]] [[universal grammar]] of human languages, holds that it would be impossible for a human to naturally learn an alien language because it would most probably violate the universal grammar inborn in humans. Humans would have to study an alien language by the slow way of discovery, the same way as scientists do research in, say, physics.<ref>[https://chomsky.info/198311__/ "Things No Amount of Learning Can Teach"], Noam Chomsky interviewed by John Gliedman, ''Omni'', 6:11, November 1983 (retrieved June 19, 2017)</ref>

Linguist [[Keren Rice]] posits that basic communication between humans and aliens should be possible, unless "the things that we think are common to languages—situating in time [and] space, talking about participants, etc.—are so radically different that the human language provides no starting point for it."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Alien Interpreters: How Linguists Would Talk to Extraterrestrials|url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alien-interpreters-how-linguists-would-talk-to-extraterrestrials/|website = Scientific American |accessdate = 2018-04-09}}</ref>

[[McGill University]] Linguistics Professor, [[Jessica Coon]] was consulted for the linguistic aspect of the 2016 film ''[[Arrival (film)| Arrival]]''. While acknowledging that the language used in the film was art, she states that film is a fairly accurate portrayal of the approach human linguists would use in trying to understand an alien language.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 'Arrival' nails how humans might actually talk to aliens, a linguist says|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/alien-language-in-arrival-linguist-2016-11|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2018-01-19}}</ref>
