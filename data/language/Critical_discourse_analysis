'''Critical discourse analysis''' ('''CDA''') is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of [[discourse]], or put simply talk and text, that views language as a form of [[Social practice theory|social practice]]. Scholars working in the tradition of CDA generally argue that (non-linguistic) social practice and linguistic practice constitute one another and focus on investigating how societal power relations are established and reinforced through language use.<ref name=Fairclough1>{{Cite book |title=Critical Discourse Analysis: The Critical Study of Language |last=Fairclough |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Fairclough |publisher=Longman |year=1995 |isbn=978-0582219847|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3djbAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> In this sense, it differs from [[discourse analysis]] in that it highlights issues of power asymmetries, manipulation, exploitation, and structural inequities in domains such as education.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Critical Discourse Analysis  |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume= 29|issue=1 |page=447–466 |author1=Jan Blommaert |author2=Chris Bucean|date=2000}}</ref>

==Background==
Critical discourse analysis emerged from 'critical linguistics' developed at the [[University of East Anglia]] in the 1970s, and the terms are now often interchangeable.<ref>Some still insist on distinctions between the two terms, although they are relatively minor</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Language and Control |last=Fowler |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Fowler|author2= [[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], [[Gunther Kress]], [[Tony Trew]]|publisher=Routledge |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-7100-0288-4}}</ref> Research in the field of [[sociolinguistics]] was paying little attention to social hierarchy and power.<ref>Wodak, R. (2001) "What CDA is about" In: Wodak, Ruth & Meyer, Michael (eds.) (2001) ''Methods of Critical Discourse Analysis.'' London: Sage. p. 5</ref> CDA was first developed by the [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] school of linguists of which [[Norman Fairclough]] was the most prominent figure. [[Ruth Wodak]] has also made a major contribution to this field of study.

In addition to [[Linguistics|linguistic]] theory, the approach draws from social theory—and contributions from [[Karl Marx]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]—in order to examine ideologies and power relations involved in discourse. Language connects with the social through being the primary domain of [[ideology]], and through being both a site of, and a stake in, struggles for power.<ref name=Fairclough1/> Ideology has been called the basis of the social representations of groups, and, in psychological versions of CDA developed by [[Teun A. van Dijk]] and Ruth Wodak, there is assumed to be a sociocognitive interface between [[social structure]]s and discourse structures.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Ideology: A Multidisciplinary Approach |last=van Dijk |first=Teun Adrianus |authorlink=Teun A. van Dijk  |publisher=Sage Publications |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7619-5654-9}}</ref> The historical dimension in critical discourse studies also plays an important role.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Methods of Critical Discourse Analysis |last=Wodak |first=Ruth |authorlink=Ruth Wodak |author2=Michael Meyer |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7619-6154-3}}</ref>

==Methodology==
Although CDA is sometimes mistaken to represent a 'method' of [[discourse analysis]], it is generally agreed upon that any explicit method in discourse studies, the humanities and social sciences may be used in CDA research, as long as it is able to adequately and relevantly produce insights into the way discourse reproduces (or resists) social and political inequality, power abuse or domination.<ref>Fairclough, Norman, Critical discourse analysis: the critical study of language. Harlow: Longman</ref><ref>Fairclough, Norman, Language and globalization. Oxon: Routlege</ref> That is, CDA does not limit its analysis to specific structures of text or talk, but systematically relates these to structures of the [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] context. CDA has been used to examine political speech acts, to highlight the rhetoric behind these, and any forms of speech that may be used to manipulate the impression given to the audience.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roffee |first=JA |year=2016 |title=Rhetoric, Aboriginal Australians and the Northern Territory intervention: A socio‐legal investigation into pre‐legislative argumentation |journal=International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy |volume=5|issue=1|pages=131–147 |doi=10.5204/ijcjsd.v5i1.285}}</ref> However, there have been flaws noted with CDA. For example, it has been said that it is simultaneously too broad to distinctly identify manipulations within the rhetoric, yet is also not powerful enough to appropriately find all that researchers set out to establish.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roffee |first=JA |year=2014 |title=Synthetic Necessary Truth Behind New Labour's Criminalisation of Incest|journal=Social and Legal Studies|volume=23 |issue=1|pages=113–130 |doi=10.1177/0964663913502068}}</ref>

Norman Fairclough developed a three-dimensional framework for studying discourse, where the aim is to map three separate forms of analysis onto one another: analysis of (spoken or written) language texts, analysis of discourse practice (processes of text production, distribution and consumption) and analysis of discursive events as instances of sociocultural practice.<ref name=Fairclough1/><ref>{{Cite book |title=Language and Power |last=Fairclough |first=Norman |publisher=Longman |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-582-41483-9}}</ref> Particularly, he combines micro, meso and macro-level interpretation. At the micro-level, the analyst considers various aspects of textual/linguistic analysis, for example syntactic analysis, use of metaphor and rhetorical devices.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} The meso-level or "level of discursive practice" involves studying issues of production and consumption, for instance, which institution produced a text, who is the target audience, etc. At the macro-level, the analyst is concerned with [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] and interdiscursive elements and tries to take into account the broad, societal currents that are affecting the text being studied.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Narrative and Discursive Organizational Studies To Text or Context?
