'''Roy Goodwin D'Andrade''' (November 6, 1931 &ndash; October 20, 2016) was one of the founders of [[cognitive anthropology]].

Born in [[New Jersey]], D'Andrade matriculated at [[Rutgers University]] but left to fulfill his military service. He completed his undergraduate studies at the [[University of Connecticut]]. He then studied in the Department of [[Social relation|Social Relations]] at [[Harvard]], from which he received his PhD in [[Social Anthropology]]. He taught at [[Stanford University]] from 1962-1969. He then moved to the [[University of California, San Diego]], where he was professor of Anthropology until 2003 and served as department chair for three separate terms. He also taught in the Anthropology department at the [[University of Connecticut]]. He died October 20, 2016.

His research interests ranged widely, including [[African-American family structure]], [[wikt:personality|personality]], [[color perception]], and mathematical models for reconstructing mitochondrial lineages. A unifying theme in much of his work, however, is the problem of identifying and describing cultural models (also known as folk models, or the often implicit, culturally shared ways that people assume the world works); in recent years he was particularly concerned with conceptualizing [[Cultural schema theory|cultural models]] through [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] theory. In 2002, D'Andrade was awarded the [[NAS Award for Scientific Reviewing]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=Reviewing>{{cite web|title=NAS Award for Scientific Reviewing|url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_scirev|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=27 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318130922/http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_scirev|archivedate=18 March 2011|df=}}</ref>
