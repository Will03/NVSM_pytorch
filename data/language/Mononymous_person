A '''mononymous person''' is an individual who is known and addressed by a single name, or mononym.{{efn|From the [[Greek language|Greek]] μόνος, ''mónos'' ("single"), and ὄνομα, ''ónoma'' ("name"). [[Noun]]: "mononym"; [[adverb]]: "mononymously"; [[verb]]: "mononymize"; [[abstract noun]]: "mononymity".<ref>See {{cite web|url=http://wordsmith.org/awad/archives/0503|title=mononym|date=2003-05-06|publisher=A Word a Day|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>}}{{efn|"[[Mononym]]" is defined in ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd edition, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1989, volume IX, p. 1023) as "A term consisting of one word only […] Hence ''mononymic'' […] a[djective], consisting of a mononym or mononyms; ''mononymy'' […], a mononymic system; ''mononymize'' v[erb], to convert into a mononym; whence ''mononymization''."  The term is attested in the English language as early as 1872.}} In some cases, that name has been selected by the individual, who may have originally been given a [[:Wiktionary:polynym|polynym]] ("multiple name"). In other cases, it has been determined by the custom of the country{{efn|For example, [[Javanese name]]s traditionally are mononymic.}} or by some interested segment. In the case of historical figures, it may be the only one of the individual's names that has survived and is still known today.

== Antiquity ==
[[File:King Narmer.jpg|thumb|[[Narmer]], ancient Egyptian pharaoh]]

The structure of persons' names has varied across time and geography. In some societies, individuals have been mononymous, receiving only a single name. [[Alulim]], first king of [[Sumer]], is one of the earliest names known; [[Narmer]], an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]], is another. In addition, Biblical names were typically mononymous, as were names in the surrounding cultures of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. 

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] names also follow the pattern, with [[epithet]]s (similar to second names) only used subsequently by historians to avoid confusion, as in the case of [[Zeno the Stoic]] and [[Zeno of Elea]]; likewise, [[patronymic]]s or other biographic details (such as [[Polis|city]] of origin, or another city the individual was associated with, borough, occupation) were used to specify whom one was talking about, but these details were not considered part of the name.

A departure from this custom occurred, for example, among the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], who by the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] period and throughout the [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] period [[Tria nomina|used multiple names]]: a male citizen's name comprised three parts (this was mostly typical of the upper class, while others would usually have only two names): ''[[praenomen]]'' (given name), ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'' (clan name) and ''[[cognomen]]'' (family line within the clan)&nbsp;— the ''nomen'' and ''cognomen'' were almost always hereditary.<ref>[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], ''Dictionary of the Bible'', p. 2060.</ref>

Mononyms in other ancient cultures include the [[Celts|Celtic]] queen [[Boudica]] and the [[Numidia]]n king [[Jugurtha]]. However, the historical records of some of these figures are scanty or rely completely on the documentation of those outside the person's culture, so it is possible such figures may have had other names within their own cultures that have since been lost to history.

==Medieval uses==

===Europe===
During the [[early Middle Ages]], mononymity slowly declined, with northern and eastern Europe keeping the tradition longer than the south; an example is [[Edeko]], the [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic]] chieftain whose son ruled Italy as [[Flavius Odoacer]]. By the end of the period, surnames had become commonplace: [[Edmund Ironside]], for example, ruled England (although Ironside was an epithet added later in life), [[Brian Boru]] was [[High King of Ireland]], [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] had united Scotland, and even in [[Scandinavia]] surnames were taking hold. The [[Dutch Renaissance]] scholar and theologian [[Erasmus]] is a late example of mononymity; though sometimes referred to as "Desiderius Erasmus" or "Erasmus of Rotterdam", he was christened only as "Erasmus", after the [[martyr]] [[Erasmus of Formiae]].

===The Americas===
[[File:Pocahontas by Simon van de Passe 1616.jpg|thumb|[[Pocahontas]], Native American princess]]

Between Columbus' arrival in the New World and the late 19th century, most{{cn|date=January 2017}} [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were mononymous. Examples include [[Moctezuma I|Moctezuma]] (Mexico, 1398–1469), [[Anacaona]] (Haiti, 1464–1504), [[Agüeybaná I|Agüeybaná]] (Puerto Rico, died 1510), [[Diriangen]] (Nicaragua, fl. 1520), [[Urracá]] (Panama, died 1531), [[Guamá]] (Cuba, died 1532), [[Atahualpa]] (Peru, 1497–1533), [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (Honduras, died 1537), [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]] (Chile, 1534–1557), [[Tamanaco]] (Venezuela, died 1573), [[Pocahontas]] (United States, 1595–1617), [[Auoindaon]] (Canada, fl. 1623), [[Cangapol]] (Argentina, fl. 1735), and [[Tecumseh]] (United States, 1768–1813). 

Uniquely, the Dutch-Seneca diplomat [[Cornplanter]] received both a [[Seneca language|Seneca-language]] mononym (Kaintwakon, roughly "corn-planter") from his mother and a given name and surname (John Abeel) from his father, and he used both throughout his life.  His later descendants, such as [[Jesse Cornplanter]], used "Cornplanter" as the family name instead of "Abeel". 

In the 19th century, most chiefs involved in the [[Apache Wars]] had mononym birth names, and some replaced those with mononymous nicknames: [[Geronimo]] (born Goyaałé), [[Victorio]] (born Beduiat), [[Cochise]], and so on.

==Post-medieval uses==
Since the medieval period, mononyms in the West have almost exclusively been used to identify people who already had surnames. These [[nickname]]s were either adopted by the persons themselves or conferred by contemporaries.

===France===
[[File:Pierre Mignard - Portrait de Jean-Baptiste Poquelin dit Molière (1622-1673) - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Molière]], 17th-century French dramatist]]

Some French authors have shown a preference for mononyms. In the 17th century, the dramatist and actor Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622–73) took the mononym [[stage name]] [[Molière]].

In the 18th century, François-Marie Arouet adopted the mononym [[Voltaire]], for both literary and personal use, in 1718 after his imprisonment in Paris' [[Bastille]], to mark a break with his past. The new name combined several features. It was an [[anagram]] for a [[Latin]]ized version of his family [[surname]], "Arouet, l[e] j[eune]"; it reversed the syllables of the name of a family ''[[château]]'', Airvault; and it has implications of speed and daring through similarity to French expressions such as "voltige", "volte-face" and "volatile". "Arouet" would not have served the purpose, given that name's associations with "[[Breaking wheel#Metaphorical uses|roué]]" and with an expression that meant "for thrashing".<ref>[[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]], ''Sidetracks'', pp. 345–66; and "Voltaire's Grin", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', November 30, 1955, pp. 49–55.</ref>

The 19th-century French author [[Marie-Henri Beyle]] used many [[pen name]]s, most famously the mononym Stendhal, adapted from the name of the little [[Prussia]]n town of [[Stendal]], birthplace of the German art historian [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], whom Stendhal admired.<ref>F.W.J. Hemmings, "Stendhal", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 25, p. 680.</ref> 

In the 20th century, a fourth French writer, [[Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette]] (author of ''[[Gigi]]'', 1945), used her actual surname as her mononym pen name, Colette.<ref>Elaine Marks, "Colette", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 7, p. 230.</ref> Some French actors and singers have used their given name or surname as a stage mononym.

===Other Europe===
[[File:Franz Gareis - Novalis.jpg|thumb|[[Novalis]], 18th-century German philosopher]]

In the 17th and 18th centuries, most Italian [[castrato]] singers used mononyms as stage names (e.g. [[Caffarelli (castrato)|Caffarelli]], [[Farinelli]]). The German writer, mining engineer and philosopher, Georg Friedrich Philipp Freiherr von Hardenberg (1772–1801), became famous as [[Novalis]]. 

The 19th-century Dutch writer Eduard Douwes Dekker (1820–87), better known by his mononymous pen name [[Multatuli]] (from the [[Latin]] ''multa tuli'', "I have suffered [or ''borne''] many things"), became famous for the satirical novel, ''Max Havelaar'' (1860), in which he denounced the abuses of [[colonialism]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]). In 2002 Multatuli was proclaimed by the Society for Dutch Literature to have been the most important Dutch writer of all time. 

The Dutch writer Jan Hendrik Frederik Grönloh (1882–1961) wrote under the pseudonym [[Nescio]] (Latin for "I don't know").

The 20th-century British author [[Hector Hugh Munro]] became known by his [[pen name]], Saki. In 20th-century Poland, the [[theater of the absurd|theater-of-the-absurd]] [[playwright]], novelist, [[Painting|painter]], photographer and [[History of philosophy in Poland#Twentieth century|philosopher]] [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]] after 1925 often used the mononymous pseudonym Witkacy, a [[conflation#Language|conflation]] of his surname (''Witkiewicz'') and [[middle name]] (''Ignacy'').<ref>"[[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz|Witkiewicz, Stanisław Ignacy]]", ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', pp. 747–48.</ref>

A number of visual artists, such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Rembrandt]], are commonly known by mononyms. The modern Russian artist [[Erté]] formed his mononymous [[pseudonym]] from the initials of his actual name, as did the Belgian comics writers [[Hergé]] and [[Jijé]].

Italian painter [[Bernardo Bellotto]], who is now ranked as an important and original painter in his own right, traded on the mononymous pseudonym of his uncle and teacher, Antonio Canal ([[Canaletto]]), in those countries—Poland and Germany—where his famous uncle was not active, calling himself likewise "Canaletto". Bellotto remains commonly known as "Canaletto" in those countries to this day.<ref>"[[Bernardo Bellotto|Bellotto, Bernardo]]", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 3, p. 520.</ref>

[[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] (Gaspard-Félix Tournachon, 1820-1910) was an early French photographer.

==Royalty==
[[File:Emperor Akihito cropped Akihito 090710-1600b.jpg|thumb|[[Akihito]], Emperor of Japan]]

[[Monarch]]s and other [[Royal family|royalty]], for example [[Napoleon]], have traditionally availed themselves of the [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] of using a mononym, modified when necessary by an [[regnal number|ordinal]] or [[epithet]] (e.g., Queen [[Elizabeth II]] or [[Charles the Great]]). This is not always the case: King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] of Sweden has two names. While many European royals have formally sported [[Personal names#Feudal names|long chains]] of names, in practice they have tended to use only one or two and not to use [[surname]]s.{{efn|The names of a few European kings ''have'' included surname&nbsp;— for example, those of most of Poland's [[Monarchs of Poland|elected kings]], such as [[Stefan Batory|Stefan ''Batory'']].<ref>"Stephen Báthory", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 3, p. 346.</ref>}} 

In Japan, the emperor and his family have no surname, only a given name, such as [[Hirohito]], which in practice in Japanese is rarely used: out of respect and as a measure of politeness, Japanese prefer to say "the Emperor" or "the Crown Prince".<ref>Peter Wetzler, ''Hirohito and War: Imperial Tradition and Military Decision-Making in Prewar Japan'', preface, University of Hawaii Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8248-1166-6}}.</ref> Following an Emperor's death or retirement, he is renamed according to the era of his reign. In India, the first six [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors were known by just one name, adopted by each emperor upon his accession.

[[Roman Catholic]] [[pope]]s have traditionally adopted a single, [[regnal name]] upon their [[List of papal elections|election]] (except for [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]] and [[Pope John Paul II|II]]). The mononymous tradition reverted to form with the election and succession of Pope [[Benedict XVI]] in 2005 and Pope [[Pope Francis|Francis]] in 2013.

==Modern times==

===Mononym-normal===
The Western practice of combining a given name (Christian name or [[given name|forename]]) with a family name ([[surname]]) is not universal.

Surnames were introduced in [[Turkey]] only after [[World War I]], by that country's first president, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], as part of his westernizing and modernizing program.<ref>Jan Siwmir, "''Nieziemska ziemia''" ("An Unearthly Land"), ''[[Gwiazda Polarna]]'' [The Pole Star]: ''America's oldest independent Polish-language newspaper'', Stevens Point, Wisconsin, vol. 100, no 18, August 29, 2009, p. 1.</ref>  His own surname, Atatürk, which was bestowed by the Turkish parliament, means "Father Turk". Common people can be addressed semi-formally by their given name plus the title [[Bey]] or [[Khanum|Hanım]] (without surname), whereas politicians are often known by surname only ([[Bülent Ecevit|Ecevit]], [[Süleyman Demirel|Demirel]]). Many Turkish sportspeople, especially football players, wear jerseys with only their first name.

Mononyms are also common in Indonesia for [[Javanese name|Javanese individual]]s, both prominent government figures such as former presidents [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]] and commoners such as [[Triyatno]].

Most Icelanders do not have surnames, only [[patronymics]] (sometimes [[matronymic]]s), and they address each other by given name, even in formal situations.

===Asia===
In modern times, in countries that have long been part of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] (Japan, [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]] and China itself), mononyms are rare. An exception pertains to the [[Emperor of Japan]] (a common opinion being that there is no state{{huh|date=September 2018}} to give the [[Japanese name|family name]] ({{lang|ja|苗字}}) to the Emperor). 

Mononyms are common as [[stage name]]s in the [[entertainment industry]], usually when the performer's legal name is not publicly known; e.g., [[Ayaka]], [[Becky (television personality)|Becky]], [[Gackt]], [[Hide (musician)|hide]], [[Hyde (musician)|Hyde]], [[Mana (Japanese musician)|Mana]], [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]], [[Miyavi]], [[Tsunku]], and [[Yui (singer)|Yui]]. Also, Japanese baseball star [[Ichiro Suzuki]] is widely known in both Japan and North America as "Ichiro". In [[Hong Kong]], a few musicians are also known by mononyms, e.g., [[Janice Vidal|Janice]],<ref name="CDbook">All Janice Vidal albums are credited mononymously as "Janice".{{Cite book

Mononyms continue to be used in parts of India, especially the South. [[Mayawati]], former [[Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh|Chief Minister]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], chooses to use only a single name. Several Indian film personalities, such as [[Asin]], [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]], [[Rekha]], [[Kajol]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Rajnikanth]], [[Govinda (actor)|Govinda]] and [[Pran (actor)|Pran]],  are also mononymous. [[Govindjee]], Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Plant Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an Indian-American and an authority on photosynthesis, publishes his research under his singular name. In the northeastern India state of Mizoram, most people have a single name, mostly of three syllables (e.g., Lalthansanga, Thangrikhuma, Zorinmawia).  Everyone also has a tribal or clan name inherited from their father, but they do not include it in their official name.

Mononyms are also common in [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Javanese name]]s. In some cases, such as those of former Presidents [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]], the mononym is the full legal name. Other mononyms, such as [[Rossa (singer)|Rossa]], [[Chrisye]] and [[Tohpati]], are stage names taken from a nickname or are part of the full name.

Single names still also occur in [[Tibet]]<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4607454.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Tibets most famous woman blogger Woeser detained by police | first=Jane | last=MacArtney | date=August 26, 2008 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}</ref> and [[Mongolia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Most [[Afghanistan|Afghans]] have no [[surname]].<ref>[[National Public Radio]] report of 18 May 2009 about civilian Afghan victims of U.S. [[Drone aircraft|drone-aircraft]] bombings in the U.S.-[[Taliban]] war.

In [[Thailand]], people usually address each other in informal situations by nicknames ({{lang-th|ชึ่อเล่น|translit=chue-len}}). Given by parents or relatives in early childhood, these nicknames are typically one syllable (or worn down from two syllables to one). They may often be nonsense words or humorous, and usually have no relation to the person's actual name, although in some cases may be diminutive forms of their first name, like "Nok" for "Noknoi" which means respectively bird and little bird, the first used as nickname and the second being the first name. All Thais have such a name, even the [[Thai royal family|royal family]], and they are freely used in everyday life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Mononyms are common in [[Myanmar]]. [[U Thant]], a Myanmar diplomat, was the third [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] (1961–71).  "U" is an honorific in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], roughly equal to "Mr". "''Thant''" was his only name, per local convention. In Myanmar, he was known as ''Pantanaw U Thant'', in reference to his hometown, [[Pantanaw]].

In the [[Near East]]'s [[Arab]] world, the Syrian poet Ali Ahmad Said Esber (born 1930) at age 17 adopted the mononym pseudonym, [[Adunis]], sometimes also spelled "Adonis".  A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in literature, he has been described as the greatest living poet of the Arab world.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jan/27/adonis-syrian-poet-life-in-writing|title=Adonis: a life in writing|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=27 January 2012|accessdate=27 January 2012|quote=each autumn is credibly tipped for the Nobel in literature}}</ref>

===The West===
In the West, mononymity, as well as its use by royals in conjunction with titles, has been primarily a privilege of [[celebrity|famous]] persons such as prominent writers, [[artist]]s, [[entertainer]]s, musicians and [[athlete]]s.{{efn|"A mononym is a name consisting of a single word. They are generally favored by celebrities of sufficient stature to be identified in this way, such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Pelé]]."<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/mononym] "Mononym", on Answers.com</ref>}}{{efn|A [[Paris Hilton]] [[lookalike]], [[Chantelle Houghton]], nicknamed "[[Paris Travelodge]]", became famous "for not being famous" after winning an extraordinary ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. Lucy Rock writes: "It is a select band. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]], [[Pelé]], [[Thalía]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]... even, possibly, [[Katie Price|Jordan]].<!--She now uses her real name.--> People who wear their fame with such confidence that they have dispensed with the... concerns of having more than one name. They are the '''mononym brigade'''. Now there is one more.... Chantelle is... the apotheosis of that celebrity narrative that first gave us people who were famous for being good at something. Then came the people who were famous for simply... being famous. Now there is Chantelle, who is famous for not being famous at all."<ref>Lucy Rock, "From Nobody Much to Someone Special", ''[[The Observer]]'', January 29, 2006 [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/29/broadcasting.bigbrother]</ref>}}

Some persons, such as the artists [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent]] and [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]], the sculptor [[Chryssa]], and the singer-songwriter [[Basia]], have had polynymous names that were unwieldy, or unfamiliar and difficult to remember or to pronounce in the community in which they were currently active, but have not wanted to entirely change their names to something more familiar to the broad public at the cost of abandoning their sense of [[self-identification]], and so have used only a single part of their full names.

The case of the Icelandic musician [[Björk]] is similar, but her use of a single name also has roots in her native culture. Like most Icelanders, she [[Icelandic name|has no family name]]; the second part of her full name is a patronymic.  In her case, ''Björk Guðmundsdóttir'' literally translates to "''Björk, Guðmund's daughter''". Icelanders generally address one another solely by given names even in formal settings.

Some mononym stage names are the performer's [[given name]] (e.g., [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]], [[Zendaya]], [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], [[Selena]], [[Cher]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Beyoncé]]) while others may be the performer's [[middle name]] (e.g., [[Rihanna]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]), or [[surname]] (e.g. [[Liberace]], [[Mantovani]], [[Morrissey]]). Some mononym stage names are invented (e.g.  [[Eminem]], [[P!nk]], [[Lorde]]), adopted words (e.g. [[Capucine]], French for "[[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]]") or nicknames (e.g., [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Bono]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]).

In [[Lusophone]] countries such as [[Portugal]], [[Cape Verde]] and especially [[Brazil]], football players often adopt a mononym (e.g. [[Pelé]], [[Nani]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Eusébio]], [[Marta (footballer)|Marta]]<!-- four examples (2 x nicknames + 2 x given names) is plenty - please discuss on the talk page before changing the examples used - thanks -->). In Spain, mononyms for football players are also very common; they include the player's first name ([[Xavi]], [[Sergi Barjuán|Sergi]], [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]]), derivations of the player's surname ([[Ferran Corominas|Coro]], [[Guti (footballer)|Guti]]), derivations of the player's first name ([[Juanfran (footballer, born 1985)|Juanfran]], [[Kiko (Spanish footballer)|Kiko]]), diminutives ([[Juanito (footballer, born 1976)|Juanito]], [[Mista (footballer)|Mista]]), and nicknames ([[Míchel (footballer)|Michel]], [[Arteaga (footballer)|Arteaga]], [[Arzu (footballer)|Arzu]]). Because there are a few very common surnames in Spain (García, Pérez, López, Hernández), the use of mononyms makes it easier to distinguish between the many Garcías and Pérezes on each team. Mononyms are occasionally used by players from other countries, for example the [[Venezuela]]n [[Miku (footballer)|Miku]], the [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] [[Gervinho]] and the [[Serbia]]n-born [[United States|American]] [[Preki]]. Mononyms can be seen in other sports in these countries, with examples including Brazilian basketball players [[Hortência Marcari|Hortência]] and [[Nenê]].

Also in Brazil, former president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] is known as "Lula", a nickname he officially added to his full name. Such mononyms, which take their origin in [[given name]]s, [[surname]]s or [[nickname]]s, are used because [[Portuguese names]] tend to be rather long.

The American writer of non-fiction and fiction, [[Rodney William Whitaker]] (1931–2005), is best known for some novels that he wrote under the mononym [[pen name]], Trevanian. The Armenian-Canadian [[portrait photographer]] [[Yousuf Karsh]] was commonly known as "Karsh of [[Ottawa]]".

The [[comedian]] and [[illusionist]] [[Teller (entertainer)|Teller]], the silent half of the duo [[Penn & Teller]], legally changed his original polynym, Raymond Joseph Teller, to the mononym "Teller" and possesses a [[United States passport]] issued in that single name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/home/2007-11-15-teller-at-home_N.htm|title=At home: Teller's magical Vegas retreat speaks volumes|work=[[USA Today]]|author=della Cava, Marco R.|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/04/12/penn-and-teller-gerard-bakardy-rose-shadows-trick/|title=Penn & Teller: Rogue Magician Is EXPOSING Our Secrets!!!|publisher=[[TMZ.com]]|date=2012-04-12|accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref>

The professional wrestler [[The Ultimate Warrior|Warrior]] (born James Hellwig) legally changed his name to the mononym "Warrior" in an effort to boost his standing in a trademark dispute with his employer, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]. His children now use the Warrior name (as opposed to Hellwig) as their surname. [[Chyna]] did likewise when the [[World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.|now-WWE]] attempted to restrict her use of the name in pornographic titles; reports conflict as to whether she changed it back to her birth name, Joan Laurer, before she died.

Some have selected their mononym themselves, when they have been able to do so, because of its distinctiveness.  Others have come to be known by a mononym that has been applied to them by some segment of the public. [[Oprah Winfrey]], famed American talk show host, is usually referred to by only her first name, Oprah. The public has referred to President [[George W. Bush]] by the mononym "Dubya" ([[eye dialect]] of "W"), to distinguish from his father, President [[George H.W. Bush|George (H.W.) Bush]].

Both mechanisms contributed in the case of [[Hillary Clinton]], who has been called, and has publicly called herself, "Hillary". [[Peter Funt]], of ''[[Candid Camera]]'', wrote in a February 21, 2007 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' [[op-ed]] piece, "The Mononym Platform": "Someone has apparently decided that Mrs. Clinton will be the first major single-name candidate since 1952, when [[Dwight Eisenhower|Ike's]] P.R. gurus realized that 'Eisenhower' was tough to fit on a bumper sticker. ... In an apparent attempt to model her marketing on the likes of Madonna, Beyoncé and Cher, Mrs. Clinton's site proclaimed: 'Today, Hillary took the first step...'"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/opinion/21funt.html The Mononym Platform] ''New York Times''</ref> In an interview with Hillary Clinton published in [[Salon.com]], the interviewer acknowledged receiving reader accusations of sexism whenever he referred to Clinton in print as "Hillary" (in contrast with male candidates who were almost always referred to by their last names), although he stated it was primarily to avoid confusion with her husband, President [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/06/18/hillary_interview|title=Hillary's hard-won experience
|author=Walter Shapiro|publisher=Salon.com|date=Jun 18, 2007}}</ref>

Examples of mononyms also exist in modern popular culture. For instance, some characters on the [[NBC]] television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' are referred to only by their last names as a mononym, most prominently: [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]], played by [[Michael Richards]], and [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], played by [[Wayne Knight]]. Newman's name is clearly a true mononym, in that his first name is never used or even revealed. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, is revealed to the other characters and the audience, and so his name could be seen as less of a mononym. However, this does not occur until the show's sixth season, and after the revelation he is still referred to as Kramer. Additionally, on the [[ABC Studios|ABC]] television sitcom [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Home Improvement'']], the character Wilson, played by [[Earl Hindman]], a next-door neighbor of the central characters, is only referred to as Wilson. His full name, Wilson Wilson, is not revealed until the fourth season.
