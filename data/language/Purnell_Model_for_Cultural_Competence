The '''Purnell Model for Cultural Competence''' is a broadly utilised model for teaching and studying [[intercultural competence]],{{Sfn|Tortumluoğlu|2006|p=6}} especially within the [[nursing]] profession. Employing a method of [[systems theory]],{{Sfn|Xu|Shelton|Polifroni|Anderson|2006|p=391}} the model incorporates ideas about cultures, persons, healthcare and [[health professional]]s{{Sfn|Harper|2008|p=13}} into a distinct and extensive evaluation instrument used to establish and evaluate [[cultural competence in healthcare]].{{Sfn|Debiasi|Selleck|2017|p=39}} Although the Purnell Model was originally created for nursing students, the model can be applied in learning/teaching, management, study and practice settings,{{Sfn|Snider|2010|p=8}} within a range of countries and cultures.{{Sfn|Reid|2010|p=8}}

== History and Description ==
The '''"Purnell Model for Cultural Competence"''' was developed by [[Larry D. Purnell]] and [[Betty J. Paulanka]],{{Sfn|Whitman|2006|p=15}} as an outline to classify and arrange elements that have an affect on the [[culture]] of an individual.{{Sfn|Edwards|2007|p=9}} The framework uses an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] method to encourage cultural awareness and appreciation{{Sfn|Debiasi|Selleck|2017|p=39}} in relation to healthcare. It offers a basis for individual's providing care to gain knowledge around concepts and features that relate to various cultures{{Sfn|Albougami|Pounds|Alotaibi|2016|p=3}} in anticipation of assisting the performance of [[Cultural competence in healthcare|culturally competent care]] in clinical settings. The model has been recognised as a way to integrate [[Transcultural nursing|transcultural]] proficiency into the execution of [[nursing]]{{Sfn|Albougami|Pounds|Alotaibi|2016|p=3}} and in “primary, secondary and tertiary”{{Sfn|Tortumluoğlu|2006|p=6}} environments.

Cultural competence has been described as a process, which is constantly occurring and through which one slowly advances{{Sfn|NASA|2013}} from lacking knowledge to developing it. An [[individual]] begins as unconsciously unskilled{{Sfn|Whitman|2006|p=49}} due to their absence of personal knowledge that they are lacking awareness about other cultures. Next, an individual becomes aware of their incompetence due to their acknowledgement that they have insufficient comprehension of other [[culture]]s. Individuals then become deliberately competent (through learning about others’ cultures) so that they are able to apply personalised interventions. Finally, individuals gradually become oblivious to their competence{{Sfn|Whitman|2006|p=49}} due to their ability to instinctively provide patients with [[Cultural competence in healthcare|culturally competent care]].

In [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] societies, it is becoming essential for [[Health professional|healthcare professionals]] to be able to provide [[Cultural competence in healthcare|culturally competent care]] due to the results of enhanced personal health,{{Sfn|Suh|2004|p=93}} as well as the [[health]] of the overall population. The greater the overall knowledge a health practitioner has about cultures, the better their ability is to conduct evaluations and in turn provide culturally competent suggestions to [[patient]]s. Purnell's model requires the caregiver to contemplate the distinct identities of each patient and their views towards their treatment{{Sfn|Albougami|Pounds|Alotaibi|2016|p=3}} and care.

== The Purnell Model ==
[[File:Diagram_of_the_Purnell_Model.png|thumb|363x363px|This is diagram I have created to help illustrate the Purnell Model based on my article.]]
The model proposed by Purnell and Paulanka{{Sfn|Whitman|2006|p=15}} includes four circles of varying sizes that are representative of the [[Nursing theory#Common concepts of nursing modeling: a metaparadigm|metaparadigms]] that are applied to [[nursing]],{{Sfn|Albougami|Pounds|Alotaibi|2016|p=3}} as well as a twelve-part inner circle that illustrates the various “cultural domains”.{{Sfn|Brathwaite|2005|p=363}}

=== Metaparadigm ideas (outer circles) ===
The outer circles of the model are interconnected [[Nursing theory#Common concepts of nursing modeling: a metaparadigm|metaparadigm]] ideas that relate to nursing, and are involved within the process of providing an individual with care.{{Sfn|Gurung|2014|p=8}} The outermost (first) circle is used to represent the global [[society]],{{Sfn|NASA|2013}} the second circle represents the concept of [[community]], the third of [[family]], and the innermost (fourth) circle illustrates the [[individual]] person.

==== Global society ====
Global society relates to observing the world as an interconnected whole{{Sfn|Morrall|2009|p=10}} that consists of a range of individuals from various [[Culture|cultural]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] backgrounds. Concepts that are present and influence this unified world include globalisation forces and the rapid growth of [[Information and communications technology|communication technologies]] that impact upon how the global society is maintained. It is critical to consider a person's place within the diverse world [[community]]{{Sfn|Harper|2008|p=19}} as influencing forces on the global [[society]] can impact not only the civilisation, but also an individual's world outlook.

==== Community ====
[[File:Family_group_portrait_of_Mr_and_Mrs_M_Young_and_family_of_Waterloo_House,_Waterford,_1913.jpg|thumb|Family group portrait of Mr and Mrs M Young and family of Waterloo House, Waterford, 1913]]
[[Community]] is included in the model, as a [[Nursing theory#Common concepts of nursing modeling: a metaparadigm|metaparadigm]], as in the provision of [[Cultural competence in healthcare|culturally competent care]]; an individual's situation within a community must be addressed. Through considering a [[Patient|patient's]] sense of community, [[Health professional|care providers]] acknowledge that different communities may have divergent values, ethics and goals.{{Sfn|Hatzichristou|Lampropoulou|Lykitsakou|2008|p=109}}   

==== Family ====
An [[Individual|individual's]] relationship with their [[family]] is essential to consider in the deliverance of [[Health care|care]]. This is because each individual may want to differently consider/explain who constitutes family, and additionally the degree to which they want family members to be involved in their care may fluctuate.{{Sfn|Clay|Parsh|2016|p=41}}   

==== Person ====
[[Person]]s must be considered in the performance of [[Cultural competence in healthcare|culturally competent care]], as each individual has their own sense of self,{{Sfn|Xu|Shelton|Polifroni|Anderson|2006|p=391}} values, [[belief]]s and ideas. Due to every person having their own distinct way of relating to their environment, forming social relationships and communicating with others in their [[community]]{{Sfn|Tortumluoğlu|2006|p=6}} and broader [[society]]. Individual's beliefs and values may impact upon how they wish to be treated.

=== The Domains (Inner Circle) ===
[[File:Anker_Grossvater_erzählt_eine_Geschichte_1884.jpg|thumb|Passing on cultural heritage. 'Grandfather tells a story' Anker Grossvater erzählt eine Geschichte 1884]]
The twelve inner pieces of the model are cultural domains that are composed of concepts that should be focused upon when evaluating [[patient]]s. Each of the twelve domains should not be viewed as separate or diverse entities, instead it should recognised that they can influence and inform each other{{Sfn|Snider|2010|p=8}} and hence should be viewed as unified parts of a whole.  

==== Overview/Heritage ====
This domain refers to concepts such as one's origin{{Sfn|NASA|2013}} that are vital in the aptitude of an individual in understanding both themselves and their patients.

==== Communication ====
This construct relates to the interactions an individual has been exposed to throughout their life and [[Socialization|socialisation]] process, for example with [[family]], [[Peer group|peers]] and the wider [[community]]. It also conveys the importance of an individual's ability to provide [[Communication#Verbal|verbal cues]] such as volume/tone{{Sfn|Whitman|2006|p=51}} and [[Communication#Non-verbal|non-verbal cues]] such as [[body language]] and [[eye contact]].{{Sfn|Axford|2015|p=5}}  

==== Family roles and organisation ====
This domain refers to [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] and structures existent within [[Family|families]] that may be dependent on [[gender]] or age,{{Sfn|Albougami|2016|p=43}} which have the ability to influence not only family interactions but also the way in which an individual both communicates and acts.

==== Workforce issues ====
[[File:Burying_the_placenta,_C16_Chinese_painted_book_illustration_Wellcome_L0039985.jpg|thumb|Pregnancy custom in China. Burying the placenta. "It was believed that placing the placenta in a pit in the doorway helped the child to become healthy, powerful, strong, wise and unafraid of strangers.{{Sfn|Takayama|1999|p=5}}"
Burying the placenta, C16 Chinese painted book illustration Wellcome L0039985]]
Workforce issues denotes the way in which aspects present within a [[workplace]] such as language barriers,{{Sfn|NASA|2013}} may have an effect on an individual and their sense of being and belonging.

==== Biocultural ecology ====
The concept of biocultural ecology relates to disparities that exist between the diverse range of racial and cultural groups{{Sfn|NASA|2013}} such as biological variations,{{Sfn|Harper|2008|p=15}} which need to be considered to gain a greater understanding and appreciation for other [[culture]]s.

==== High-risk behaviours ====
High-risk behaviours like consumption of alcohol{{Sfn|Whitman|2006|p=51}} are vital to consider as they exist within all [[culture]]s but the degrees to which they are used and subsequent impacts fluctuate.   

==== Nutrition ====
[[Nutrition]] should be considered due to variations that exist between different [[culture]]s such as food intake and the values of certain foods.{{Sfn|Axford|2015|p=6}}   

==== Pregnancy and childbearing ====
This concept is important for an individual to understand whilst providing [[Cultural competence in healthcare|culturally competent care]] due to the presence of diverse cultural [[belief]]s about [[pregnancy]].{{Sfn|Whitman|2006|p=52}} There are also various practices and [[tradition]]s that exist within ethnocultural groups{{Sfn|Albougami|2016|p=44}} that need to be respected when providing care.

==== Death rituals ====
This domain is fundamental in the deliverance of [[Cultural competence in healthcare|culturally competent healthcare]], as the care provider must recognise patients’ opinions towards [[death]], and their customs towards occasions such as burial ceremonies.{{Sfn|NASA|2013}}   

==== Spirituality ====
[[File:Shrimad_Rajchandra_Spiritual_Centre.jpg|thumb|Spirituality and Prayer. Shrimad Rajchandra Spiritual Centre]]
[[Spirituality]] is essential to consider in the acquisition of knowledge about others’ [[culture]]s and their practices, for example an individual's views and habits of [[prayer]].{{Sfn|Gurung|2014|p=12}}   

==== Health care practices ====
This domain should be considered in the provision of culturally competent care, as practices like [[organ transplantation]]{{Sfn|Whitman|2006|p=52}} require the comprehension of an individual's situation and necessity for care as well as cultural considerations.   

==== Health care practitioner ====
This concept should be considered when providing an individual with care due to there being varying opinions and views that are existent among cultures, for example in relation to [[Health professional|health care providers]].{{Sfn|Axford|2015|p=6}}   

=== Centre of Model ===
The black circle featured in the centre of the diagram remains vacant to symbolise that which is still unknown.{{Sfn|NASA|2013}}   

=== Pointed Line ===
The line that is present under the circular figure is representative of the progressions and lapses, which occur to cultural proficiency, that are dependent on situations and occurrences{{Sfn|Harper|2008|p=15}} that individuals are confronted with.  

== Objectives   ==
The '''Purnell Model for Cultural Competence''' seeks to accomplish multiple goals towards achieving [[Intercultural competence|cultural competence]]. The model was initially created with the objective of offering a guide in which [[Health professional|healthcare professionals]] could use to aid them in acquiring knowledge about different cultures’ ideas and features. The model has been proposed as an approach to help explain situations and occurrences that have the ability to influence the way individual's view [[culture]] universally in regards to historical viewpoints.{{Sfn|Purnell|2002|p=196}} It is also intended to offer a way for social and ethnic data to be examined, through an outline that is representative of human attributes. The model is proposed as a basis for [[Health professional|healthcare practitioners]] to understand [[Patient|patient's]] interactions and connections in relation to their cultural setting. The overall goal the model was created to attain is to enable the individuals providing care to do so in a way which is thoughtful and skilled, as to encourage consistency as a result of being aware of interdependent cultural features.{{Sfn|Purnell|2002|p=196}}

== Applications ==

=== Practice ===
The Purnell Model is intended for application in a range of settings/professions including: nursing, physiotherapy, sociology, social work, and in general medical practice.{{Sfn|Tortumluoğlu|2006|p=6}} [[Health professional|Healthcare practitioners]] can employ the Purnell model in practice to aid in the provision of [[Cultural competence in healthcare|culturally competent care]] to [[patient]]s.{{Sfn|Albougami|2016|p=47}} The model can be applied to assist in the improvement and advancement of evaluation instruments, personalised healthcare plans and approaches to designing future strategies.{{Sfn|Tortumluoğlu|2006|p=6}} Purnell has noted himself, that the “[[Oncology Nursing Society|Oncology Nurses Society]]” have utilised the framework to create their principles.{{Sfn|Purnell|2002|p=196}}

=== Learning/Teaching ===
The Purnell Model is implemented within nursing programs through the inclusion of cultural outlines and has also been utilised to aid in the gathering of facts and statistics.{{Sfn|Tortumluoğlu|2006|p=6}} It has additionally been observed that the framework is employed within undergraduate educational settings and to guide in teaching how to appropriately evaluate a patient's wellbeing.{{Sfn|Lipson|Desantis|2007|p=13S}} The model is recognised within the coursework for a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's degree]] in nursing as an outline that can be incorporated into numerous programs.{{Sfn|Harper|2008|p=16}}

=== Administration ===
The model has been implemented to assist with [[employee training]] in several countries.{{Sfn|Brathwaite|2003|p=4}} Administrators in several [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] workplaces apply the model to encourage and endorse both recognition and acceptance of all staff members, non-dependent on their cultural and ethnic backgrounds.{{Sfn|Tortumluoğlu|2006|p=6}} The concept of workforce issues from within the model can be applied in professional settings, to benefit [[workplace]] culture and to find a solution to any complications that arise.  

=== Research ===
Multiple individuals completing requirements for their studies (e.g., [[Master's degree|Masters]] and [[Doctorate]]) have applied the model in order to maintain an [[Research#Research ethics|ethical approach]] to gathering information and conducting research.{{Sfn|Tortumluoğlu|2006|p=6}} 

== Strengths ==
The Purnell Model facilitates the potential to acquire information directly relevant to various [[culture]]s due to consideration given to each patient's circumstances.{{Sfn|Higginbottom|Richter|Mogale|Ortiz|2011|p=8}} Flexibility has been recognised as a critical quality of the model, as it is able to improve the prospective pertinence, of the model, to a range of settings like [[nursing]].{{Sfn|Albougami|2016|p=48}} The importance of the model is also acknowledged due to its ability to represent multiple outlooks on the world; that assist when providing individuals with [[Cultural competence in healthcare|culturally competent care]].{{Sfn|Brathwaite|2003|p=7}} The model has additionally been recognised to incorporate suppositions that are coherent in relation to the model's foundations, as well as containing well-defined explanations of the domains.{{Sfn|Harper|2008|p=16}}  

[[Angela Cooper Brathwaite]], who has conducted assessments on a variety of cultural competence models, has stated that the model is “comprehensive in content, very abstract, has logical congruence, conceptual clarity, demonstrates clinical utility and espouses the experiential-phenomenological perspective”.{{Sfn|Brathwaite|2003|p=7}} The utilisation of a [[systems theory]] model is considered to be a beneficial quality of the framework, as well as the non-sequential scale provided to attain cultural competence.{{Sfn|Harper|2008|p=20}} Purnell's model is also perceived to have precision and coherence in reference to the clarity of the structure and its comprehensibility for intended users.{{Sfn|Reid|2010|p=8}} 

== Limitations/Weaknesses ==
The Purnell Model does not account for the results that the provision of [[Cultural competence in healthcare|culturally competent care]] achieves/fails to achieve, in relation to the [[patient]] and their [[health]].{{Sfn|Shen|2014|p=314}}  This limitation results in a lack of authentication as to whether or not the model is successful in terms of the conduct of the care provider, and the consequences for patients.{{Sfn|Shen|2014|p=314}} The model's visual complexity can be seen as a limitation, as it may result in a lack of comprehension and diminish the model's function/value and its applicability.{{Sfn|Harper|2008|p=16}} As the framework is [[methodological]],{{Sfn|Stewart|DeNisco|2018|p=123}} it is considered to be quite abstract, which could detract from the model's utility in practice settings.{{Sfn|Shen|2014|p=315}} There is also a conceivable limitation in the instance that the model's material could be simplified beyond practical confines, so that the information provided/directed at an individual could mistakenly be used for an entire populous.{{Sfn|Snider|2010|p=9}} The intersecting concepts employed within the model can also be seen as a flaw, as only the minimum as to which is required to justify the concept should be used.{{Sfn|Harper|2008|p=16}}
