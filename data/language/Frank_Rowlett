'''Frank Byron Rowlett''' (May 2, 1908 – June 29, 1998) was an American [[cryptologist]].

==Life and career==
Rowlett was born in [[Rose Hill, Lee County, Virginia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ehc.edu/about/outcomes/notable-alumni|title=Notable Alumni|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2016}}</ref> and attended [[Emory & Henry College]] in [[Emory, Virginia]].  In 1929 he received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and chemistry. He was hired by [[William Friedman]] as a "junior cryptanalyst" for the [[Signals Intelligence Service]] (SIS) on [[April Fools' Day]] 1930; shortly after, he was followed into SIS by [[Abraham Sinkov]] and [[Solomon Kullback]].

During the 1930s, after a lengthy period of training, Rowlett and his colleagues compiled [[Code (cryptography)|code]]s and [[cipher]]s for use by the [[U.S. Army]] and began solving a number of foreign, notably [[Japan]]ese, systems. In the mid-1930s, they solved the first Japanese machine for [[encipher]]ment of [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] communications, known to the Americans as [[RED (cipher machine)|RED]]. In 1939–40, Rowlett led the [[Signals Intelligence Service|SIS]] effort that solved a more sophisticated Japanese diplomatic machine cipher, codenamed [[PURPLE]] by the U.S. Once, when asked what his greatest contribution to that effort had been, Rowlett said, "I was the one who believed it could be done."<ref>{{cite web|title=Frank B. Rowlett|url=https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/hall-of-honor/1999/frowlett.shtml|website=Cryptologic Hall of Honor|publisher=National Security Agency|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Rowlett also played a crucial role in protecting American communications during [[World War II]], making fundamental and innovative contributions to the design of the [[SIGABA]]  [[cipher|cipher machine]]. Its security was an important factor in saving American lives in combat. In 1964, Congress awarded Rowlett US$100,000, equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|100000|1964|r=-4|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}, as partial compensation for his classified cryptologic inventions.

In addition to having highly developed cryptanalytic skills, Rowlett was a good manager, and he rose quickly within the organization. In 1943–45 he was chief of the General Cryptanalytic Branch, and in 1945-1947 chief of the Intelligence Division. From 1949 to 1952, he was technical director in the Office of Operations of the [[Armed Forces Security Agency]], predecessor to the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA).

Rowlett differed with General [[Ralph J. Canine]], the first director of NSA, over personnel movements, including his own. Acting on his differences, he transferred to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in 1952 and worked there until 1958. At that time he returned to [[NSA]] as a Special Assistant to the Director. In 1965 Rowlett became commandant of the [[National Cryptologic School]]. In 1965, Rowlett was awarded the [[President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service]].<ref>http://www.lbjlibrary.org/collections/on-this-day-in-history/june.html</ref> He retired from federal service in 1966.  In 1965 he was awarded the [[National Security Medal]] by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] for his work on breaking the Japanese [[PURPLE|Purple]] cipher.

Rowlett has been inducted into the [[Military Intelligence Hall of Fame]].

Because of his importance in the protection of American communications, the [[Information Systems Security Organization]] has named its highest award the [[Frank Byron Rowlett Award]].

Frank Rowlett died June 29, 1998, at age 90.
