'''''Decoding Chomsky: Science and Revolutionary Politics''''' is a 2016 book by the left-wing activist and linguistic anthropologist [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]] on [[Noam Chomsky]]'s approach to science and politics. Knight admires Chomsky's politics, but argues that his linguistic theories were influenced in damaging ways by his immersion since the early 1950s in an intellectual culture heavily dominated by US military priorities, an immersion deepened when he secured employment in a Pentagon-funded electronics laboratory in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<ref>Letters, ''London Review of Books'', July 13, 2017</ref>

In October 2016, Chomsky dismissed the book, telling ''[[The New York Times]]'' that it was based on a false assumption since, in fact, no military "work was being done on campus" during his time at MIT.<ref>''Noam Chomsky and the Bicycle Theory.'' Sam Tanenhaus interviews Noam Chomsky. ''The New York Times'', October 31, 2016</ref> In a subsequent public comment, Chomsky on similar grounds denounced Knight's entire narrative as a "wreck ... complete nonsense throughout".<ref name="auto">Sam Fenn interviews Chris Knight and Noam Chomsky responds. ''Chomsky's Carburetor.'' Cited Podcast. http://citedpodcast.com/23-chomskys-carburetor/</ref> In contrast, a reviewer for the US ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' described ''Decoding Chomsky'' as perhaps "the most in-depth meditation on 'the Chomsky problem' ever published".<ref>''The Chomsky Puzzle. Piecing together a celebrity scientist'', by Tom Bartlett. ''Chronicle of Higher Education,'' August 25, 2016.</ref> In the UK, the ''[[New Scientist]]'' described Knight's account as "trenchant and compelling".<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23230980-800-the-value-of-everything-getting-radical-about-research/''New Scientist,'' November 2, 2016]</ref> The controversy continued in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', where the sociologist of science [[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]] cited ''Decoding Chomsky'' approvingly, provoking Chomsky to denounce what he called "Knight's astonishing performance" in two subsequent letters.<ref>[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n09/jackson-lears/mysterian Letters], ''London Review of Books'', June 1; June 15; July 13, 2017</ref> The debate has continued in the pages of Open Democracy.

Since the book was published, Knight has published evidence that Chomsky worked on a military sponsored "command and control" project for the [[MITRE Corporation]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2018/03/when-the-pentagon-looked-to-chomskys-linguistics-for-their-weapons-systems.html "When the Pentagon Looked to Chomsky's Linguistics for their Weapons Systems"], 3 Quarks Daily, 12 March 2018.</ref>

== The argument ==
[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|Noam Chomsky in 2017]]

''Decoding Chomsky'' begins with Chomsky's claim that his political and scientific outputs have little connection with each other. For example, asked in 2006 whether his science and his politics are related, Chomsky replied that the connection is "almost non-existent ... There is a kind of loose, abstract connection in the background. But if you look for practical connections, they're non-existent."<ref>''Decoding Chomsky'', p. 248, n. 20, citing ''Irish Times'', January 21, 2006.</ref>

Knight accepts that scientific research and political involvement are distinct kinds of activity serving very different purposes. But he claims that, in Chomsky's case, the conflicts intrinsic to his institutional situation forced him to drive an unusually deep and damaging wedge between his politics and his science.

Knight points out that Chomsky began his career working in an electronics laboratory whose primary technological mission he detested on moral and political grounds. Funded by the Pentagon, the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT was involved in contributing to the basic research required for hi-tech weapons systems.<ref>''Decoding Chomsky'', p. xi, citing 'Tri-Services Honor MIT Achievements in Military Electronics R&D', ''Army Research and Development News Magazine,'' Vol. 12 no.4, July-August 1971, p 68.</ref> Suggesting that he was well aware of MIT's role at the time, Chomsky himself recalls: {{quotation|"There was extensive [military] research on the MIT campus. ... In fact, a good deal of the [nuclear] missile guidance technology was developed right on the MIT campus and in laboratories run by the university."<ref>''Decoding Chomsky'', p. xiv, citing {{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=N.|title=Language and Politics|date=2004|publisher=AK Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=1-902593-82-0|page=216|edition=Second}}</ref>|}}

It was because of his anti-militarist conscience, Knight argues, that such research priorities were experienced by him as deeply troubling. By way of evidence, Knight cites this correspondence from ''The New York Review of Books'' in 1967:

{{quotation| '''[[George Steiner]]''': "Will Noam Chomsky announce that he will stop teaching at MIT or anywhere in this country so long as torture and napalm go on? ... Will he even resign from a university very largely implicated in the kind of 'strategic studies' he so rightly scorns?"

'''Noam Chomsky''': "I have given a good bit of thought to the specific suggestions that you put forth... leaving the country or resigning from MIT, which is, more than any other university, associated with activities of the department of 'defense.' ... As to MIT, I think that its involvement in the war effort is tragic and indefensible."<ref>Abbreviated in ''Decoding Chomsky'', p. 37; citing full text in ''The New York Review of Books'', March 23, 1967</ref>|}}

Chomsky's situation at MIT, according to Knight, is summed up by Chomsky when he describes some of his colleagues this way:

{{quotation| "It is appalling that a person can come through an MIT education and say the kinds of things that were quoted in the ''New York Times'' article on Sunday, November 9 [1969]... One student said, right along straight Nazi scientist lines: '''What I'm designing may one day be used to kill millions of people. I don't care. That's not my responsibility. I'm given an interesting technological problem and I get enjoyment out of solving it.''' You know perfectly well that we can name twenty faculty members who've said the same thing. ... This is an attitude that is very widely held and very widely expressed."<ref>Abbreviated in ''Decoding Chomsky'', p. xviii, citing full text in Chomsky, N. 2002. ''On Democracy and Education.'' Edited by C. P. Otero, p. 290.</ref>|}}

Chomsky, then, apparently felt that a number of his colleagues were no better than Nazi scientists. In order to maintain his moral and political integrity, Knight argues, Chomsky resolved to limit his cooperation to pure linguistic theory of such an abstract kind that it could not conceivably have any military use.

With this aim in mind, Chomsky's theoretical modelling became so abstract that not even language's practical function in social communication could be acknowledged or explored. One damaging consequence, according to Knight, was that scientific investigation of the ways in which real human beings use language became divorced from what quickly became the prevailing MIT school of formal linguistic theory.

Knight argues that the conflicting pressures Chomsky experienced had the effect of splitting his intellectual output in two, prompting him to ensure that any work he conducted for the military was purely theoretical—of no practical use to anyone—while his activism, being directed relentlessly ''against'' the military, was preserved free of any obvious connection with his science.

To an unprecedented extent, according to Knight, mind in this way became divorced from body, thought from action, and knowledge from its practical applications, these disconnects characterizing a philosophical paradigm which came to dominate much of intellectual life for half a century across the Western world.

== Reception ==

''Decoding Chomsky'' has been both criticised and acclaimed by wide variety of commentators.

===Negative===


* '''[[Norbert Hornstein]]''' and '''Nathan Robinson''' dismiss the book as betraying a complete misunderstanding of Chomsky's linguistic theories and beliefs. They question the motives of Yale University Press, asking why Yale considered it appropriate to publish Knight's critique, which they say attacks Chomsky through political conjecture rather than addressing his linguistic or political ideas. Comparing Knight's Marxist criticism to a conservative criticism that was released in the same year by Tom Wolfe, they speculate that both were published with similar motivations - that Chomsky's criticisms were a threat to the power behind the publishers.(''Current Affairs'').<ref name="currentaffairs.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/12/thousand-ways-to-misrepresent-noam-chomsky|title=1000 Ways To Misrepresent Noam Chomsky |work=Current Affairs}}</ref>

* '''[[Robert Barsky]]''' argues that since Knight was never formally trained in Chomsky's conception of theoretical linguistics, he has no right to comment on whether it stands up as science. ''Decoding Chomsky,'' claims Barsky, offers no original insights, consisting only of "a weak rehash of critiques from naysayers to Chomsky's approach". While Barsky concedes that Chomsky did work in a military laboratory, he argues that this cannot be significant since virtually all US scientists receive Pentagon funding one way or another. (''Moment'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.momentmag.com/book-review-decoding-chomsky/|title=Book Review // Decoding Chomsky |work=Moment Magazine |date=September 2016}}</ref>

* '''Peter Stone''' claims that  Knight hates Chomsky and "for that reason, he wrote ''Decoding Chomsky'' – a nasty, mean-spirited, vitriolic, ideologically-driven hatchet job". Stone states that, although Knight is on the Left, "the level of venom on display here exceeds that of all but the most unhinged of Chomsky’s detractors on the Right." He goes   to state that "Knight spares no opportunity to paint Chomsky’s every thought and deed in the blackest possible terms" and that: "''Decoding Chomsky'' is not a critique of a body of work in linguistics; it is an attempt to demonise a man for his perceived political deviations, even though that man happens to be on the same side of the political spectrum as the man who is demonising him. Reading ''Decoding Chomsky'' taught me something about the mindset of the prosecutors in the Moscow Show Trials."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/127/Decoding_Chomsky_by_Chris_Knight|title=Book Review // Decoding Chomsky |work=Philosophy Now|date=September 2018}}</ref>

* '''Wolfgang Sperlich''' targets Knight's explanation for the so-called "Chomsky problem", the supposedly striking disconnect between Chomsky the activist (working against the military) and Chomsky the scientist (working in a military lab). According to Sperlich, Knight insinuates that Chomsky was willing "to sell his soul for a fat salary package". Sperlich responds: "What does Chris Knight want from him? That he dress in rags and live in a hovel?" Sperlich claims that at no point did Chomsky collude with any of the Pentagon's plans to make use of his research.

In his book, Knight points out that the US military initially funded Chomsky's linguistics because they were interested in machine translation. Later their focus shifted and Knight cites Air Force Colonel Edmund Gaines’ statement that: "We sponsored linguistic research in order to learn how to build command and control systems that could understand English queries directly."<ref>''Decoding Chomsky'', pp. 53–72 and 16, citing Frederick Newmeyer, ''The Politics of Linguistics'', Chicago 1986, pp. 85–6.</ref>

In 1971, a former Air Force Colonel, Anthony Debons, wrote: "much of the research conducted at MIT by Chomsky and his colleagues [has] direct application to the efforts undertaken by military scientists to develop ... languages for computer operations in military command and control systems."
