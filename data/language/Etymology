'''Etymology''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|t|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i|}})<ref name="OED">[[The New Oxford Dictionary of English]] (1998) {{ISBN|0-19-861263-X}} – p. 633 "'''Etymology''' /ˌɛtɪˈmɒlədʒi/ the study of the class in words and the way their meanings have changed throughout time".</ref> is the study of the [[history]] of [[word]]s, their origins, and how their form and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] have changed over time.<ref name="OED"/> By extension, the term "the etymology (of a word)" means the origin of the particular word and for place names, there is a specific term, [[toponymy]].

For [[Greek language|Greek]]—with a long [[recorded history|written history]]—etymologists make use of texts, and texts about the language, to gather knowledge about how words were used during earlier periods and when they entered the language. Etymologists also apply the methods of [[comparative linguistics]] to reconstruct information about languages that are too old for any direct information to be available.

By analyzing related languages with a technique known as the [[comparative method]], linguists can make inferences about their shared parent language and its vocabulary. In this way, [[root (linguistics)|word roots]] have been found that can be traced all the way back to the origin of, for instance, the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]].

Even though etymological research originally grew from the [[philology|philological]] tradition, much current etymological research is done on [[language family|language families]] where little or no early documentation is available, such as [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]].

The word ''etymology'' derives from the Greek word {{wikt-lang|grc|ἐτυμολογία}} ({{grc-transl|ἐτυμολογία}}), itself from {{wikt-lang|grc|ἔτυμον}} ({{grc-transl|ἔτυμον}}), meaning "true sense", and the suffix ''-logia'', denoting "the study of".<ref>{{OEtymD|etymology}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|e)tumologi/a|ἐτυμολογία}}, {{LSJ|e)/tumos|ἔτυμον|ref}}.</ref> 

In [[linguistics]], the term ''etymon'' refers to a word or morpheme (e.g., stem<ref>According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the ultimate etymon of the English word ''machine'' is the Proto-Indo-European '''stem''' ''*māgh'' "be able to", see p. 174, {{cite book |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=978-1403917232}}</ref> or root<ref>According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the co-etymon of the Israeli word ''glida'' "ice cream" is the Hebrew '''root''' ''gld'' "clot", see p. 132, {{cite book |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=978-1403917232}}</ref>) from which a later word derives. For example, the Latin word ''candidus'', which means "white", is the etymon of English ''candid''.

==Methods==

Etymologists apply a number of methods to study the origins of words, some of which are:

* [[Philology|Philological]] research. Changes in the form and meaning of the word can be traced with the aid of older texts, if such are available.
* Making use of [[dialectology|dialectological]] data. The form or meaning of the word might show variations between dialects, which may yield clues about its earlier history.
* The [[comparative method]]. By a systematic comparison of related languages, etymologists may often be able to detect which words derive from their common ancestor language and which were instead later borrowed from another language.
* The study of [[semantic change]]. Etymologists must often make hypotheses about changes in the meaning of particular words. Such hypotheses are tested against the general knowledge of semantic shifts. For example, the assumption of a particular change of meaning may be substantiated by showing that the same type of change has occurred in other languages as well.

== Types of word origins ==

Etymological theory recognizes that words originate through a limited number of basic mechanisms, the most important of which are [[language change]], borrowing (i.e., the adoption of "[[loanwords]]" from other languages); [[word formation]] such as [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] and [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]]; and [[onomatopoeia]] and [[sound symbolism]], (i.e., the creation of imitative words such as "click" or "grunt").

While the origin of newly emerged words is often more or less transparent, it tends to become obscured through time due to sound change or semantic change. Due to [[sound change]], it is not readily obvious that the English word ''set'' is related to the word ''sit'' (the former is originally a [[causative]] formation of the latter). It is even less obvious that ''bless'' is related to ''blood'' (the former was originally a derivative with the meaning "to mark with blood").

[[Semantic change]] may also occur. For example, the English word ''bead'' originally meant "prayer". It acquired its modern meaning through the practice of counting the recitation of prayers by using beads.

== English language ==
{{Main|History of the English language}}

English derives from [[Old English]] (sometimes referred to as Anglo-Saxon), a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] variety, although its current vocabulary includes words from many languages.<ref>The American educator: a library of universal knowledge ..., Volume 3
 By Charles Smith Morris, Amos Emerson Dolbear</ref> The Old English roots may be seen in the similarity of numbers in [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], particularly ''seven/sieben,'' ''eight/acht,'' ''nine/neun,'' and ''ten/zehn.''  [[Pronoun]]s are also cognate: ''I/mine/me and ich/mein/mich''; ''thou/thine/thee and du/dein/dich''; ''we/wir and us/uns''; ''she/sie; your/ihr.
''
However, [[historical linguistics|language change]] has eroded many grammatical elements, such as the [[noun case]] system, which is greatly simplified in modern English, and certain elements of vocabulary, some of which are borrowed from [[French language|French]]. Although many of the words in the English lexicon come from Romance languages, most of the common words used in English are of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin.

When the [[Normans]] conquered England in 1066 (see [[Norman Conquest]]), they brought their [[Norman language]] with them. During the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] period, which united insular and continental territories, the ruling class spoke [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], while the peasants spoke the vernacular English of the time. Anglo-Norman was the conduit for the introduction of French into England, aided by the circulation of [[Langue d'oïl]] literature from France.

This led to many paired words of French and English origin. For example, ''[[beef]]'' is related, through borrowing, to modern French ''bœuf,'' ''[[veal]]'' to ''{{lang|fr|veau}},'' ''[[pork]]'' to ''{{lang|fr|porc}},'' and ''[[poultry]]'' to ''{{lang|fr|poulet}}.''  All these words, French and English, refer to the meat rather than to the animal. Words that refer to farm animals, on the other hand, tend to be cognates of words in other Germanic languages.  For example, ''swine/Schwein,'' ''cow/Kuh,'' ''calf/Kalb,'' and ''sheep/Schaf.''  The variant usage has been explained by the proposition that it was the Norman rulers who mostly ate meat (an expensive commodity) and the Anglo-Saxons who farmed the animals.  This explanation has passed into common [[folklore]] but has been disputed.

=== Assimilation of foreign words ===
{{Further|Loanword|Lists of English words by country or language of origin}}

English has proved accommodating to words from many languages.  Scientific terminology, for example, relies heavily on words of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, but there are a great many non-scientific examples. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] has contributed many words, particularly in the southwestern United States.  Examples include {{wikt-lang|en|buckaroo}}, {{wikt-lang|en|alligator}}, {{wikt-lang|en|rodeo}}, {{wikt-lang|en|savvy}}, and states' names such as {{wikt-lang|en|Colorado}} and {{wikt-lang|en|Florida}}.  {{wikt-lang|en|Albino}}, {{wikt-lang|en|palaver}}, {{wikt-lang|en|lingo}}, {{wikt-lang|en|verandah}}, and {{wikt-lang|en|coconut}} from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]; {{wikt-lang|en|diva}} and ''prima donna'' from [[Italian language|Italian]].  Modern French has contributed {{wikt-lang|en|café}}, {{wikt-lang|en|cinema}}, {{wikt-lang|en|naive}}, {{wikt-lang|en|nicotine}} and many more. 

{{wikt-lang|en|Smorgasbord}}, {{wikt-lang|en|slalom}}, and {{wikt-lang|en|ombudsman}} are from [[Scandinavian languages|Swedish, Norwegian and Danish]];  {{wikt-lang|en|sauna}} from [[Finnish language|Finnish]]; {{wikt-lang|en|adobe}}, {{wikt-lang|en|alcohol}}, {{wikt-lang|en|algebra}}, {{wikt-lang|en|algorithm}}, {{wikt-lang|en|apricot}}, {{wikt-lang|en|assassin}}, {{wikt-lang|en|caliber}}, {{wikt-lang|en|cotton}}, {{wikt-lang|en|hazard}}, {{wikt-lang|en|jacket}}, {{wikt-lang|en|jar}}, {{wikt-lang|en|julep}}, {{wikt-lang|en|mosque}}, {{wikt-lang|en|Muslim}}, {{wikt-lang|en|orange}}, {{wikt-lang|en|safari}}, {{wikt-lang|en|sofa}}, and {{wikt-lang|en|zero}} from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (often via other languages); {{wikt-lang|en|behemoth}}, {{wikt-lang|en|hallelujah}}, {{wikt-lang|en|Satan}}, {{wikt-lang|en|jubilee}}, and {{wikt-lang|en|rabbi}} from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; {{wikt-lang|en|taiga}}, {{wikt-lang|en|steppe}}, {{wikt-lang|en|Bolshevik}}, and {{wikt-lang|en|sputnik}} from [[Russian language|Russian]].  

{{wikt-lang|en|Bandanna}}, {{wikt-lang|en|bungalow}}, {{wikt-lang|en|dungarees}}, {{wikt-lang|en|guru}}, {{wikt-lang|en|karma}}, and {{wikt-lang|en|pundit}} come from [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]] and ultimately [[Sanskrit]]; {{wikt-lang|en|curry}} from [[Tamil language|Tamil]]; {{wikt-lang|en|honcho}}, {{wikt-lang|en|sushi}}, and {{wikt-lang|en|tsunami}} from [[Japanese language|Japanese]]; {{wikt-lang|en|dim sum}}, {{wikt-lang|en|gung ho}}, {{wikt-lang|en|kowtow}}, {{wikt-lang|en|kumquat}} and {{wikt-lang|en|typhoon}} from [[Cantonese]].  {{wikt-lang|en|Kampong}} and {{wikt-lang|en|amok}} are from [[Malay language|Malay]]; and ''[[boondocks]]'' from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for hills or mountains, {{wikt-lang|en|bundok}}. {{wikt-lang|en|Ketchup}} derives from one or more [[South-East Asia]] and [[East Indies]] words for [[fish sauce]] or [[soy sauce]], likely by way of Chinese, though the precise path is unclear: [[Malay language|Malay]] {{wikt-lang|en|kicap}}, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] {{wikt-lang|en|ketjap}}, [[Southern Min|Chinese Min Nan]] ''kê-chiap'' and [[cognate]]s in other [[Chinese dialects]].

Surprisingly few loanwords, however, come from other languages native to the British Isles.  Those that exist include  {{wikt-lang|en|coracle}}, {{wikt-lang|en|cromlech}} and (probably) {{wikt-lang|en|flannel}}, {{wikt-lang|en|gull}} and {{wikt-lang|en|penguin}} from [[Welsh language|Welsh]]; {{wikt-lang|en|galore}} and {{wikt-lang|en|whisky}} from [[Scottish Gaelic]]; {{wikt-lang|en|phoney}}, {{wikt-lang|en|trousers}}, and {{wikt-lang|en|Tory}} from [[Irish language|Irish]]; and {{wikt-lang|en|eerie}} and {{wikt-lang|en|canny}} from [[Scots language|Scots]] (or related [[Northern England English|Northern English]] dialects).

Many [[Canadian English]] and [[American English]] words (especially but not exclusively plant and animal names) [[List of English words from indigenous languages of the Americas|are loanwords from]] [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Indigenous American languages]], such as {{wikt-lang|en|barbecue}}, {{wikt-lang|en|bayou}}, {{wikt-lang|en|chili}}, {{wikt-lang|en|chipmunk}}, {{wikt-lang|en|hooch}}, {{wikt-lang|en|hurricane}}, {{wikt-lang|en|husky}}, {{wikt-lang|en|mesquite}}, {{wikt-lang|en|opossum}}, {{wikt-lang|en|pecan}}, {{wikt-lang|en|squash}}, {{wikt-lang|en|toboggan}}, and {{wikt-lang|en|tomato}}.

== History ==
The search for meaningful origins for familiar or strange words is far older than the modern understanding of linguistic evolution and the relationships of languages, which began no earlier than the 18th century. From [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] through the 17th century, from {{IAST | [[Pāṇini]]}} to [[Pindar]] to Sir [[Thomas Browne]], etymology had been a form of witty wordplay, in which the supposed origins of words were creatively imagined to satisfy contemporary requirements; for example, the [[Ancient Greek poetry | Greek poet]] [[Pindar]] (born in approximately 522 BCE) employed inventive etymologies to flatter his patrons. [[Plutarch]] employed etymologies insecurely based on fancied resemblances in [[sounds]]. [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]'' was an encyclopedic tracing of "first things" that remained uncritically in use in Europe until the sixteenth century. ''[[Etymologicum genuinum]]'' is a [[grammatical]] [[encyclopedia]] edited at [[Constantinople]] in the ninth century, one of several similar [[Byzantine]] works. The thirteenth-century ''[[Legenda Aurea]],'' as written by [[Jacobus da Varagine|Jacobus de Vorgagine]], begins each ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'' of a saint with a fanciful [[excursus]] in the form of an etymology.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ek1skuzIZH0C&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=legenda+aurea+etymology+beginning&source=bl&ots=Gh71mjgh98&sig=HKMa7iWIeemgitLEB39GTosb0f4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbu8m4nLTWAhXrjlQKHfpwC_gQ6AEISTAH#v=onepage&q=legenda%20aurea%20etymology%20beginning&f=false|title=Women of the Gilte Legende: A Selection of Middle English Saints Lives|last=Jacobus|last2=Tracy|first2=Larissa|date=2003|publisher=DS Brewer|isbn=9780859917711|language=en}}</ref>

===Ancient Sanskrit===
{{Main|Nirukta}}
The [[Sanskrit]] linguists and grammarians of [[History of India|ancient India]] were the first to make a comprehensive analysis of linguistics and etymology. The study of Sanskrit etymology has provided Western scholars with the basis of [[historical linguistics]] and modern etymology. Four of the most famous Sanskrit linguists are:

* [[Yaska]] (c. 6th–5th centuries BCE)
* {{IAST | [[Pāṇini]]}} (c. 520–460 BCE)
* [[Katyayana|{{IAST | Kātyāyana}}]] (2nd century BCE)
* [[Patanjali|{{IAST | Patañjali}}]] (2nd century BCE)

These linguists were not the earliest Sanskrit grammarians, however. They followed a line of ancient grammarians of Sanskrit who lived several centuries earlier like [[Sakatayana]] of whom very little is known. The earliest of attested etymologies can be found in [[Vedas|Vedic literature]] in the philosophical explanations of the ''[[Brahmana]]s'', ''[[Aranyaka]]s,'' and ''[[Upanishad]]s''.

The analyses of [[Vyakarana|Sanskrit grammar]] done by the previously mentioned linguists involved extensive studies on the etymology (called ''[[Nirukta]]'' or ''Vyutpatti'' in Sanskrit) of Sanskrit words, because the ancient [[Indo-Aryans]] considered sound and speech itself to be sacred and, for them, the words of the sacred ''[[Vedas]]'' contained deep encoding of the mysteries of the soul and God.

===Ancient Greco-Roman===
One of the earliest philosophical texts of the Classical Greek period to address etymology was the [[Socratic dialogue]] ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' (c. 360 BCE) by [[Plato]]. During much of the dialogue, [[Socrates]] makes guesses as to the origins of many words, including the names of the gods. In his [[Ode]]s [[Pindar]] spins complimentary etymologies to flatter his patrons. [[Plutarch]] (''Life of [[Numa Pompilius]]'') spins an etymology for ''[[Pontifex Maximus|pontifex]]'',  while explicitly dismissing the obvious, and actual "bridge-builder":
<blockquote> <!-- Should this begin with a capitalized T or an elipsis? Question posed May 2015, since there is no reference to answer it. -->the priests, called Pontifices.... have the name of Pontifices from ''potens'', powerful, because they attend the service of the gods, who have power and command over all. Others make the word refer to exceptions of impossible cases; the priests were to perform all the duties possible to them; if anything lay beyond their power, the exception was not to be cavilled at. The most common opinion is the most absurd, which derives this word from pons, and assigns the priests the title of bridge-makers. The sacrifices performed on the bridge were amongst the most sacred and ancient, and the keeping and repairing of the bridge attached, like any other public sacred office, to the priesthood. </blockquote>

===Medieval===
{{Main|Medieval etymology}}
[[Isidore of Seville]] compiled a volume of etymologies to illuminate the triumph of religion. Each saint's legend in [[Jacob de Voragine]]'s ''[[Legenda Aurea]]'' begins with an etymological discourse on the saint's name:
<blockquote> Lucy is said of light, and light is beauty in beholding, after that S. Ambrose saith: The nature of light is such, she is gracious in beholding, she spreadeth over all without lying down, she passeth in going right without crooking by right long line; and it is without dilation of tarrying, and therefore it is showed the blessed Lucy hath beauty of virginity without any corruption; essence of charity without disordinate love; rightful going and devotion to God, without squaring out of the way; right long line by continual work without negligence of slothful tarrying. In Lucy is said, the way of light.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/goldenlegend/GoldenLegend-Volume2.htm#Lucy Medieval Sourcebook: The Golden Legend:  Volume 2 (full text)]</ref> </blockquote>

===Modern era===
{{Further|Comparative method}}

Etymology in the modern sense emerged in the late 18th-century European academia, within the context of the wider "[[Age of Enlightenment]]," although preceded by 17th century pioneers such as [[Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn]], [[Gerardus Vossius]], [[Stephen Skinner (lexicographer)|Stephen Skinner]], [[Elisha Coles]], and [[William Wotton]].  The first known systematic attempt to prove the relationship between two languages on the basis of similarity of [[grammar]] and [[lexicon]] was made in 1770 by the Hungarian, [[János Sajnovics]], when he attempted to demonstrate the relationship between [[Sami languages|Sami]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (work that was later extended to the whole [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric language family]] in 1799 by his fellow countryman, [[Samuel Gyarmathi]]).<ref name="ssix">Szemerényi 1996:6</ref>

The origin of modern [[historical linguistics]] is often traced to [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], a Welsh [[Philology|philologist]] living in [[India]], who in 1782 observed the genetic relationship between [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. Jones published his ''The Sanscrit Language'' in 1786, laying the foundation for the field of [[Indo-European linguistics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencephoto.com/media/226197/view |title=
Sir William Jones, British philologist}}</ref>

The study of etymology in [[Germanic philology]] was introduced by [[Rasmus Christian Rask]] in the early 19th century and elevated to a high standard with the ''[[German Dictionary]]'' of the [[Brothers Grimm]]. The successes of the comparative approach culminated in the [[Neogrammarian]] school of the late 19th century. Still in the 19th century, German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] used etymological strategies (principally and most famously in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]],'' but also elsewhere) to argue that moral values have definite historical (specifically, cultural) origins where modulations in meaning regarding certain concepts (such as "good" and "evil") show how these ideas had changed over time—according to which value-system appropriated them. This strategy gained popularity in the 20th century, and philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], have used etymologies to indicate former meanings of words to de-center the "violent hierarchies" of Western [[philosophy]].
