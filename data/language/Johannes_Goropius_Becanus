'''Johannes Goropius Becanus''' (23 June 1519 – 28 June 1572), born '''Jan Gerartsen''', was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physician, linguist, and [[humanism|humanist]].

==Life==

He was born '''Jan Gerartsen van Gorp''' in the town of [[Gorp, Netherlands|Gorp]], in the [[municipality]] of [[Hilvarenbeek]].  As was the fashion of the time, Gerartsen adopted a [[Latin]]ized [[surname]] based on the name of his birthplace, ''Goropius'' being rendered from "Van Gorp"' and ''Becanus'' referring to "Hilvarenbeek."

He studied medicine in [[Leuven]], and became physician to two sisters of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]: [[Mary of Austria, Queen of Hungary|Marie]] and [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleonore]], who were based in [[Brussels]] at the time.  [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], the son of Charles V, wanted him also as his doctor and offered him a rich income.  Goropius refused and established himself as ''medicus'' (town doctor) of [[Antwerp]] in 1554. Here, free of courtly intrigues, Goropius dedicated himself completely to languages, studying antiquity; and became fluent in many languages.

Goropius died in [[Maastricht]], where he was buried in the old [[Franciscan|friars minor]] church.

==Linguistic theories==

Goropius theorized that Antwerpian [[Brabantic]], spoken in the region between the [[Scheldt]] and [[Meuse]] Rivers, was the [[Adamic language|original language]] spoken in [[Garden of Eden|Paradise]].  Goropius believed that the most ancient language on Earth would be the simplest language, and that the simplest language would contain mostly short words.  Since Brabantic has a higher number of short words than do [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Goropius reasoned that it was the older language.

A corollary of this theory was that all languages derived ultimately from Brabantic.  The Latin word for “oak,” ''quercus'', Goropius derived from ''werd-cou'' (“keeps out cold”); the Hebrew name “Noah” he derived from ''nood'' (“need”).  Goropius also believed that [[Adam and Eve]] were Brabantic names (from ''Hath-Dam'', or “dam against hate"; and ''Eu-Vat'', “barrel from which people originated,” or from ''Eet-Vat'', “oath-barrel,” respectively).  Another corollary involved locating the [[Garden of Eden]] itself in the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant region]].  In the book known as ''Hieroglyphica'', Goropius also allegedly proved to his own satisfaction that [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]ics represented Brabantic.

==''Origines Antwerpianae''==

In spite of his extensive travels in Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Britain, Goropius remained attached to his homeland, and reported on various curiosities and customs from his native region.  In his ''Origines Antwerpianae'' (1569), a treatise describing the antiquities of Antwerp, Goropius reports various curiosities, among them that a youth almost nine feet tall and a woman about ten feet tall lived near his home.  He also reports that [[Ters]], a deity who seems to have been an equivalent of [[Priapus]], was invoked by Antwerpian women when they were taken by surprise or sudden fear, and that there was a house in Antwerp adjoining the prison (see [[Het Steen]]) that bore a statue which had been furnished with a large worn away [[phallus]].

==Legacy==
[[Christoffel Plantijn]] had been a friend of Goropius's and the Antwerp-based printing house known as the [[Plantin Press]], which first published Goropius's works in 1569, printed the linguist-physician’s posthumous collected work in 1580 as a massive volume of more than a thousand pages.  Goropius's work was met with a mixture of ridicule and admiration.  Goropius is considered to have given Dutch linguistics, and Gothic philology in general, a bad name.  Though Goropius had admirers (among them [[Abraham Ortelius]] and [[Richard Hakluyt]]), his etymologies have been considered "linguistic chauvinism," and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] coined the term ''[[wikt:goropism|goropism]]'', meaning absurd etymological theories. [[Justus Lipsius]] and [[Hugo Grotius]] discounted Goropius's linguistic theories.  "Never have I read greater nonsense," the scholar [[Joseph Scaliger]] wrote of Goropius's etymologies.
