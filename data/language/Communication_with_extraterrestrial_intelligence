'''Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence''' or '''CETI''' is a branch of the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] that focuses on composing and [[decipher]]ing [[interstellar messages]] that theoretically, could be understood by another technological civilization.<ref name="NYT-20170628">{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Steven |title=Greetings, E.T.

There are multiple independent organizations and individuals engaged in CETI research; the generic application of abbreviations CETI and SETI ([[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]) in this article should not be taken as referring to any particular organization (such as the [[SETI Institute]]).

CETI research has focused on four broad areas: [[mathematics|mathematical]] languages, pictorial systems such as the [[Arecibo message]], algorithmic communication systems (ACETI), and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering "natural" language communication. There remain many [[undeciphered writing systems]] in human communication, such as [[Linear A]], discovered by archeologists. Much of the research effort is directed at how to overcome similar problems of decipherment that arise in many scenarios of interplanetary communication.

On 13 February 2015, scientists (including [[Douglas Vakoch]], [[David Grinspoon]], [[Seth Shostak]], and [[David Brin]]) at an annual meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] in the [[cosmos]] was a good idea.<ref name="NYT-20150213">{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2015-02-cosmos-risky.html|title=Should We Call the Cosmos Seeking ET?

== History ==

In the 19th century there were many books and articles about the possible inhabitants of other planets. Many people believed that intelligent beings might live on the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], and [[Venus]].<ref name="Launius">{{cite journal | last=Launius | first=Roger D. | title=Venus-Earth-Mars: Comparative Climatology and the Search for Life in the Solar System | journal=Life | publisher=MDPI AG | volume=2 | issue=3 | date=19 September 2012 | issn=2075-1729 | doi=10.3390/life2030255 | pages=255–273| bibcode=2012Life....2..255L }}</ref>

Since travel to other planets was not possible at that time, some people suggested ways to signal the extraterrestrials even before radio was discovered. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] is often credited with an [[Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal|1820 proposal]] suggested that a giant triangle and three squares, the [[Pythagoras]], could be drawn on the [[Siberia]]n tundra. The outlines of the shapes would have been ten-mile-wide strips of pine forest, the interiors could be rye or wheat.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Glenn|last=Garelik |first2=J. Madeleine|last2=Nash |first3=Richard|last3=Woodbury |title=Space: Onward to Mars|magazine=Time Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967915,00.html|date=July 18, 1988|page=50|subscription=yes|volume=132|issue=3}}</ref> [[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|'''The Pythagoras]] [[Joseph Johann Littrow]] proposed in 1819 to use the Sahara as a sort of blackboard. Giant trenches several hundred yards wide could delineate twenty-mile-wide shapes. Then the trenches would be filled with water, and then enough kerosene could be poured on top of the water to burn for six hours. Using this method, a different signal could be sent every night.<ref name="Moore2006">{{cite book | last=Moore | first=P. | title=Our Universe: An Introduction | publisher=AAPPL Artists & Photographers Press, Limited | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-904332-41-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XC2CrRW01bMC&pg=PA52 | access-date=23 July 2018 | page=52}}</ref>

Meanwhile, other astronomers were looking for signs of life on other planets. In 1822, [[Franz von Gruithuisen]] thought he saw a giant city and evidence of agriculture on the moon, but astronomers using more powerful instruments refuted his claims. Gruithuisen also believed he saw evidence of life on [[Venus]]. [[Ashen light]] had been observed on Venus, and he postulated that it was caused by a great fire festival put on by the inhabitants to celebrate their new emperor. Later he revised his position, stating that the Venusians could be burning their rainforest to make more farmland.<ref>Cattermole, P., & Moore, P. (1997). Atlas of Venus. Cambridge University Press.</ref>

By the late 1800s, the possibility of life on the moon was put to rest. Astronomers at that time believed in the [[Nebular hypothesis|Kant-Laplace hypothesis]], which stated that the farthest planets from the sun are the oldest—therefore Mars was more likely to have advanced civilizations than Venus.<ref name="ebsolar">Owen, T. C. (2001) "Solar system: origin of the solar system", ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Deluxe CDROM edition</ref> Subsequent investigations focused on contacting Martians. In 1877 [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] announced he had discovered "canali" ("channels" in Italian, which occur naturally, and mistranslated as "canals", which are artificial) on Mars—this was followed by thirty years of Mars enthusiasm.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chayka |first1=Kyle |title=A Short History of Martian Canals and Mars Fever |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a17529/a-short-history-of-martian-canals-and-mars-fever/ |website=popularmechanics.com |accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> Eventually the Martian canals proved illusory.

The inventor [[Charles Cros]] was convinced that pinpoints of light observed on Mars and Venus were the lights of large cities. He spent years of his life trying to get funding for a giant mirror with which to signal the Martians. The mirror would be focused on the Martian desert, where the intense reflected sunlight could be used to burn figures into the Martian sand.<ref name="Ley 1953 p. ">{{cite book | last=Ley | first=W. | title=Rockets, missiles, and space travel | publisher=Viking Press | year=1953 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZdTAAAAMAAJ | access-date=23 July 2018 | page=}}</ref>

Inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] mentioned many times during his career that he thought his inventions such as his [[Tesla coil]], used in the role of a [[Tesla coil#Utilization and production|"resonant receiver"]], could communicate with other planets,<ref>{{cite book| last =Seifer| first =Marc J.| title =Wizard: the life and times of Nikola Tesla: biography of a genius| publisher =Carol Pub.| year =1996| location =Secaucus, New Jersey|chapter=Martian Fever (1895-1896)| isbn = 978-1-55972-329-9 | oclc = 33865102| page =157}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| date=July 20, 1931| title=Tesla at 75| periodical=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|volume=18|issue=3|pages=3|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,742063-3,00.html| postscript=<!--None-->}}.</ref> and that he even had observed repetitive signals of what he believed were extraterrestrial radio communications coming from Venus or Mars in 1899. These "signals" turned out to be terrestrial radiation, however.

Around 1900, the [[Guzman Prize]] was created; the first person to establish interplanetary communication would be awarded 100,000 francs under one stipulation: Mars was excluded because Madame Guzman thought communicating with Mars would be too easy to deserve a prize.<ref>Ley, Willy.

==Mathematical and scientific languages==

===Lincos (Lingua cosmica)===
{{main|Lincos (artificial language)}}
Published in 1960 by [[Hans Freudenthal]], ''Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse'',  expands upon Astraglossa to create a general-purpose language derived from basic mathematics and logic symbols.<ref>{{cite book | editor=Freudenthal H |year=1960 |title=Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse. Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics (Book 28) | publisher=North-Holland, Amsterdam| ISBN=978-0-444-53393-7}}</ref> Several researchers have expanded further upon Freudenthal's work. A dictionary resembling Lincos was featured in the Carl Sagan novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'' and film adaptation.

===Astraglossa===
Published in 1963 by [[Lancelot Hogben]], "Astraglossa" is an essay describing a system for combining numbers and operators in a series of short and long pulses. In Hogben's system, short pulses represent numbers, while trains of long pulses represent symbols for addition, subtraction, etc.<ref>{{cite book | author=Hogben, Lancelot |title= Science in Authority |publisher= New York: W. W. Norton |year=1963 |ISBN=1245639935}}</ref>

=== Carl Sagan ===
In the 1985 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'', [[Carl Sagan]] explored in some depth how a message might be constructed to allow communication with an alien civilization, using [[prime number]]s as a starting point, followed by various universal principles and facts of [[mathematics]] and science.

Sagan also edited a nonfiction book on the subject.<ref>Sagan, Carl. [[Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence]]. MIT Press, 1973, 428 pgs.{{ISBN|0262191067}}</ref> An updated collection of articles on the same topic was published in 2011.<ref>Vakoch, Douglas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4oxZgRn3QFYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22communication+with+extraterrestrial+intelligence%22+vakoch&hl=en&ei=wrekTd_BGc7TiAKPupDjCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence]. SUNY Press, 2011, 500 pgs.</ref>

===Arrival (film)===
In 2016, [[McGill University]] Linguistics Professor, [[Jessica Coon]], spoke with Business Insider about how 2016 sci-fi blockbuster, [[Arrival (film)|''Arrival'']], properly portrayed how humans might actually communicate with aliens.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 'Arrival' nails how humans might actually talk to aliens, a linguist says|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/alien-language-in-arrival-linguist-2016-11|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2018-01-19}}</ref> To create this language, film producers consulted with [[Wolfram Research]] Founder and CEO, [[Stephen Wolfram]] - creator of the computer programming language known as the [[Wolfram Language]] - and his son, Christopher. Together, they helped analyze approximately 100 [[logograms]] that ultimately served as the basis for the [[alien language]] utilized throughout the film. This work, along with many other thoughts with regard to artificial intelligence communication has been documented in an interview published by Space.com.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 'Arrival', AI and Alien Math: Q&A with Stephen Wolfram|url = https://www.space.com/34783-stephen-wolfram-arrival-interview.html|website = Space.com|accessdate = 2018-01-19}}</ref> During production, Wolfram's personal copy of [[Lincos (artificial language)|''Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse'']] was also on set.

===A language based on the fundamental facts of science===
Published in 1992 by Carl Devito and Richard Oehrle, ''A language based on the fundamental facts of science'' is a paper describing a language similar in syntax to Astraglossa and Lincos, but which builds its vocabulary around known physical properties.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Devito, C. | author2=Oerle, R | last-author-amp=yes |title=A Language Based on the Fundamental Facts of Science| journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |year=1990| volume= 43 | pages=561–568 | PMID= 11540499}}</ref>

===Busch general-purpose binary language used in Lone Signal transmissions===
In 2010, Michael W. Busch created a general-purpose binary language <ref>{{cite journal|title=Testing SETI Messages Design |first1=Michael W. |last1=Busch |first2=Rachel M. |last2=Reddick |work=Astrobiology Science Conference 2010 |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2010/pdf/5070.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HnXxFGgj?url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2010/pdf/5070.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}; {{allow wrap|{{cite journal|title=Testing SETI Messages (Extended version) |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/lonesignal-prod-web/ENCODING-MWB_PAPER.pdf |first1=Michael W. |last1=Busch |first2=Rachel.

This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the Lone Signal hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the Lone Signal hailing message.<ref name="Extending the syntax used by the Lone Signal Active SETI project">{{cite journal|title=Extending the syntax used by the Lone Signal Active SETI project |first1=Charles R. |last1=Chapman |work= |url=http://sites.google.com/site/lonesignalactiveseti/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IqrYp0fX?url=https://sites.google.com/site/lonesignalactiveseti/ |archivedate=2013-08-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

==Pictorial messages==
Pictorial communication systems seek to describe fundamental mathematical or physical concepts via simplified diagrams sent as [[bitmap]]s. These messages presume that the recipient has similar visual capabilities and can understand basic mathematics and geometry. A common critique of these systems is that they presume a shared understanding of special shapes, which may not be the case with a species with substantially different vision, and therefore a different way of interpreting visual information. For instance, an arrow representing the movement of some object could be interpreted as a weapon firing.

===Pioneer probes===
The two [[Pioneer plaque]]s were launched on [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]] in 1972 and 1973, depicting the location of the Earth in the galaxy and the solar system, and the form of the human body.

===Voyager probes===
Launched in 1977, the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes carried two [[Voyager Golden Record|golden records]] that were inscribed with diagrams depicting the human form, our solar system, and its location. Also included were recordings of images and sounds from Earth.

===The Arecibo message===
The [[Arecibo message]], transmitted in 1974, was a 1679 [[pixel]] image with 73 rows and 23 columns. It shows the numbers one through ten, the atomic numbers of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus, the formulas for the sugars and bases in the nucleotides of DNA, the number of nucleotides in DNA, the double helix structure of DNA, a figure of a human being and its height, the population of Earth, a diagram of our solar system, and an image of the Arecibo telescope with its diameter.

===Cosmic Call messages===
The ''[[Cosmic Call]]'' messages consisted of a few digital sections - "Rosetta Stone", copy of Arecibo Message, Bilingual Image Glossary, the Braastad message, as well as text, audio, video, and other image files submitted for transmission by everyday people around the world. The "Rosetta Stone" was composed by [[Stephane Dumas]] and [[Yvan Dutil]] and represents a multi-page bitmap that builds a vocabulary of symbols representing numbers and mathematical operations. The message proceeds from basic mathematics to progressively more complex concepts, including physical processes and objects (such as a [[hydrogen]] atom). The message is designed with a noise resistant format and characters that make it resistant to alteration by noise. These messages were transmitted in 1999 and 2003 from [[Evpatoria Planetary Radar]] under scientific guidance of [[Alexander L. Zaitsev]]. Richard Braastad coordinated the overall project.

Star systems to which messages were sent, are the following:<ref name="cplire.ru">[http://www.cplire.ru/rus/ra&sr/VAK-2004.html Передача и поиски разумных сигналов во Вселенной<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Multi-modal messages==

===Teen-Age Message===
{{Main|Teen Age Message}}
The ''[[Teen Age Message|Teen-Age Message]]'', composed by [[Russia]]n scientists ([[Aleksandr Leonidovich Zaitsev|Zaitsev]], Gindilis, Pshenichner, Filippova) and teens, was transmitted from the [[Evpatoria Planetary Radar|70-m dish of Evpatoria Deep Space Center]] to six star systems resembling that of the Sun on August 29 and September 3 and 4, 2001. The message consists of three parts:

Section 1 represents a coherent-sounding radio signal with slow Doppler wavelength tuning to imitate transmission from the Sun's center. This signal was transmitted in order to help extraterrestrials detect the TAM and diagnose the radio propagation effect of the interstellar medium.

Section 2 is analog information representing musical melodies performed on the [[theremin]]. This electric musical instrument produces a quasi-monochromatic signal, which is easily detectable across interstellar distances. There were seven musical compositions in the First Theremin Concert for Aliens. The 14-minute analog transmission of the theremin concert would take almost 50 hours by digital means; see [http://www.faces-from-earth.net/images/Files/Zaitsev_JCTE1107.pdf The First Musical Interstellar Radio Message].

Section 3 represents a well-known Arecibo-like binary digital information: the logotype of the TAM, bilingual Russian and English greeting to aliens, and image glossary.

Star systems to which the message was sent are the following:<ref name="cplire.ru"/>

===Cosmic Call 2 (Cosmic Call 2003) message===
The [[Cosmic Call]]-2 message contained text, images, video, music, the Dutil/Dumas message, a copy of the 1974 Arecibo message, BIG = Bilingual Image Glossary, the AI program ''Ella'', and the Braastad message.

==Algorithmic messages==
Algorithmic communication systems are a relatively new field within CETI. In these systems, which build upon early work on mathematical languages, the sender describes a small set of mathematic and logic symbols that form the basis for a rudimentary programming language that the recipient can run on a [[virtual machine]]. Algorithmic communication has a number of advantages over static pictorial and mathematical messages,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009|reason=cite a reliable source that says this}} including: localized communication (the recipient can probe and interact with the programs within a message, without transmitting a reply to the sender and then waiting years for a response), [[forward error correction]] (the message might contain algorithms that process data elsewhere in the message), and the ability to embed proxy agents within the message. In principle, a sophisticated program when run on a fast enough computing substrate, may exhibit complex behavior and perhaps, intelligence.

===CosmicOS===
''[[CosmicOS]]'', designed by Paul Fitzpatrick at [[MIT]], describes a [[virtual machine]] that is derived from [[lambda calculus]].

===Logic Gate Matrices===
''Logic Gate Matrices'' (a.k.a. LGM), developed by Brian McConnell, describes a universal [[virtual machine]] that is constructed by connecting coordinates in an n-dimensional space via mathematics and logic operations, for example: (1,0,0) <-- (OR (0,0,1) (0,0,2)). Using this method, one may describe an arbitrarily complex computing substrate as well as the instructions to be executed on it.{{Clarify|date=March 2009|relevance to communication? Form of compression maybe?}}

==Natural language messages==
This research focuses on the event that we receive a signal or message that is either not directed at us (eavesdropping) or one that is in its natural communicative form. To tackle this difficult, but probable scenario, methods are being developed that first, will detect if a signal has structure indicative of an intelligent source, categorize the type of structure detected, and then decipher its content: from its physical level encoding and patterns to the parts-of-speech that encode internal and external ontologies.<ref name=Elliott04 /><ref name=Elliott01 />

Primarily, this structure modeling focuses on the search for generic human and inter-species language universals to devise computational methods by which language may be discriminated from non-language and core structural syntactic elements of unknown languages may be detected.<ref name=Elliott00a /> Aims of this research include: contributing to the understanding of language structure and the detection of intelligent language-like features in signals, to aid the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.<ref name=Elliott02a /><ref name=Elliott02b />

The problem goal is therefore to separate language from non-language without dialogue, and learn something about the structure of language in the passing. The language may not be human (animals, aliens, computers...), the perceptual space may be unknown, and we cannot presume human language structure, but must begin somewhere. We need to approach the language signal from a naive viewpoint, in effect, increasing our ignorance and assuming as little as possible.<ref name=Elliott00b /><ref name=Elliott07 />

If a sequence can be tokenized, that is, separated into "words", an unknown human language may be distinguished from many other data sequences by the frequency distribution of the tokens. Human languages conform to a [[Zipf's law|Zipfian distribution]], while many (but not all) other data sequences do not. It has been proposed that an alien language also might conform to such a distribution (<ref name=Elliott00b />). When displayed in a log-log graph of frequency vs. rank, this distribution would appear as a somewhat straight line with a slope of approximately -1. [[SETI]] scientist [[Laurance Doyle]] explains that the slope of a line that represents individual [[Tokenizing#Token|tokens]] in a stream of tokens may indicate whether the stream contains linguistic or other structured content. If the line angles at 45°, the stream contains such content. If the line is flat, it does not.<ref>{{cite news|last=Freeman|first=David|title='Through The Wormhole' Host Morgan Freeman: 'We Can't Be' Alone In The Universe (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/05/morgan-freeman_n_1322480.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=25 May 2013|date=March 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Through the Wormhole: Information Theory : Video : Science Channel|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/through-the-wormhole/videos/through-the-wormhole-information-theory.htm|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref>

== Interspecies communication ==
Some researchers have concluded that in order to communicate with extraterrestrial species, humanity must first try to communicate with Earth's intelligent animal species. [[John C. Lilly]] worked on with [[interspecies communication]] by teaching dolphins English (successful with rhythms, not with understandability, given their different mouth/blowhole shapes). He practiced various disciplines of spirituality and also  ingested [[psychedelic drug]]s such as [[LSD]] and (later) [[ketamine]] in the company of dolphins.<ref>[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-ketamine-secrets-of-segas-ecco-the-dolphin-347 /the-ketamine-secrets-of-segas-ecco-the-dolphin]</ref>  He tried to determine whether he could communicate non-verbally with dolphins, and also tried to determine if some extraterrestrial radio signals are intelligent communications.  Similarly, [[Laurance Doyle]],{{CN|date=November 2018}} [[Robert Freitas]]{{CN|date=November 2018}} and [[Brenda McCowan]]{{CN|date=November 2018}} compare the complexity of cetacean and human languages to help determine whether a specific signal from space is complex enough to represent a message that needs to be decoded.
