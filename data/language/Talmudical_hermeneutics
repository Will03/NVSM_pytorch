'''Talmudical hermeneutics''' ([[Hebrew]]: מידות שהתורה נדרשת בהן) defines the rules and methods for the investigation and exact determination of the meaning of the [[Tanakh|Scriptures]], within the framework of Rabbinic Judaism. This includes, among others, the rules by which the requirements of the [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]] and the [[Halakha]] are derived from and established by the written law.<ref name=je/>

These rules relate to: 
* grammar and exegesis
* the interpretation of certain words and letters and apparently superfluous and/or missing words or letters, and prefixes and suffixes
* the interpretation of those letters which, in certain words, are provided with [[Niqqud|points]]
* the interpretation of the letters in a word according to their numerical value (see [[Gematria]])
* the interpretation of a word by dividing it into two or more words (see [[Notarikon]])
* the interpretation of a word according to its consonantal form or according to its vocalization
* the interpretation of a word by transposing its letters or by changing its vowels
* the logical deduction of a halakhah from a Scriptural text or from another law<ref name=je/>

== Classes of rules ==
{{Eras of the Halakha}}
Compilations of such [[hermeneutic]] rules were made in the earliest times. The [[tannaitic]] tradition recognizes three such collections,<ref name=je/> namely: 
# the 7 Rules of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]]<ref name=je/><ref name="avision">{{cite book |last=Sion|first=Avi|editor-first=Andrew|editor-last=Schumann|contribution =Talmudic Hermeneutics|title=Logic in religious discourse|year=2010|publisher=Ontos-Verl.|location=Frankfurt, M. [i.e.] Heusenstamm [u.a.]|isbn=978-3-86838-061-3|pages=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqI6IpwXBdoC}}</ref>  ([[baraita]] at the beginning of [[Sifra]]; [[Avot of Rabbi Natan]] xxxvii.)
# the 13 Rules of [[Rabbi Ishmael]]<ref name=je/><ref name="avision" /> ([[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael]] at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is merely an amplification of that of Hillel)
# the 32 Rules of Rabbi [[Eliezer ben Jose HaGelili]].<ref name=je/><ref name="avision" /> These last-mentioned rules are contained in an independent baraita ([[Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules]]) which has been incorporated and preserved only in later works. They are intended for haggadic interpretation, but many of them are valid for the Halakah as well, coinciding with the rules of Hillel and Ishmael.<ref name=je/>

It must be borne in mind, however, that neither Hillel, Ishmael, nor Eliezer ben Jose sought to give a complete enumeration of the rules of interpretation current in his day. For some reason they restricted themselves to a compilation of the principal methods of logical deduction, which they called "[[middot (Talmud)|middot]]" (measures), although the other rules also were known by that term (comp. [[Sifre]], Num. 2 [ed. Friedmann, p.&nbsp;2a]).<ref name=je/>.

Those rules are traditionally studied and applied to the [[religious texts]] of some [[biblical canon]], which were commonly believed to be inspired by God himself, through the words and the actions of human people. Therefore, those rules were related in coordination with the four independent level of biblical reading, as in the acronym [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]].

== Dates of the rules ==
All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the [[Talmudim]] and [[Midrashim]] have been collected by [[Malbim]] in ''Ayyelet HaShachar,'' the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra, and have been reckoned at 613, to correspond with the 613 commandments. The antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them, meaning that they cannot safely be declared older than the [[tannaim|tanna]] to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot of Hillel and the 13 of Rabbi Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them. At all events, he did not invent them, but merely collected them as current in his day, though he possibly amplified them.<ref name=je/> They were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding. Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricting or expanding them, in various ways.<ref name=je/>

The Talmud itself gives no information concerning the origin of the middot, although the [[Geonim]] regarded them as Sinaitic (הלכה למשה מסיני, "Law given to [[Moses]] at [[Mount Sinai]]"; comp. Rabbi [[Samson of Chinon]] in his ''Sefer HaKeritot'').<ref name=je/>

==Rules of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael==

[[Rabbi Akiva]] and [[Rabbi Ishmael]] and their scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these rules. Rabbi Akiva devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and exegetical rules, while Rabbi Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles which guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different.<ref name=je/>

=== Superfluity in the text ===
According to Rabbi Akiva, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous. He established two principles broadening the scope of the rule of his teacher [[Nahum of Gimzo]], who had declared that certain particles, like את, גם and או, were inclusive and certain others, such as אך, רק and מן, were exclusive.<ref name=je/> These two principles are: 
* '''אין רבוי אחר רבוי אלא למעט''' (= "one inclusion added to another is equivalent to an exclusion"; Sifra, Ẓaw, Pereḳ, 11 [ed. [[I.H. Weiss]], p.&nbsp;34d])
* '''לשונות רבויין הן''' (= "words are amplifications"; [[Jerusalem Talmud]] [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] xix. 17a)<ref name=je/>
Hence he interprets the following forms of expression as amplifications: an infinitive before a finite verb, e.g., הכרת תכרת ([[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 64b); the doubling of a word, e.g., איש איש ([[Yeb.]] 71a); and the repetition of a term by a synonym, e.g., ודבר ואמר (Jerusalem Talmud [[Soṭah]] viii. 22b). Ishmael, on the contrary, lays down the principle, (דברה תורה כלשון בני אדם = "the Torah speaks in the language of men"; Sifre, Num. 112). The [[Bible]] may, therefore, have employed superfluous words and sounds; and forced values should not be assigned to them for the purpose of deducing new rules therefrom.<ref name=je/>

The same statement holds with regard to the repetition of an entire section. Ishmael is of the opinion that "the Torah at times repeats a whole section of the [[halakha|Law]] in order to give a new application to it" (כל פרשה שנאמרה במקום אחד וחזרו שנאה במקום אחר לא שנאה אלא בשביל דבר שנתחדש בה ; Sifre, Num. 2, according to the reading of [[Elijah of Vilna]]). It is not necessary, therefore, to draw a new inference from every repetition. Thus, for instance, in [[Num.]] v. 5-8 the Torah repeats the section on אשם גזלות in [[Lev.]] v. 20-26 (vi. 1-7, A. V.) for the purpose of teaching the new ruling that in certain cases recompense for sin shall be made directly to the priests. Akiva asserts, on the other hand (in Sifre, l.c., according to the reading of Elijah of Vilna), that "Everything that is said in a section so repeated must be interpreted" (= כל מה שנאמר בה צריך להדרש), and that new deductions may be drawn from it. According to this view, in [[Num.]] v. 5-8, for example, a new meaning must be sought in the repetition of the Law.<ref name=je/>

===Vocalization of words===
According to Akiva, the traditional vocalization in the Bible of a word which may be read in various ways is well founded (יש אם למקרא); and he deduces many rules from the meanings which such words have according to traditional pointing. This rule had been formulated before Akiva by a tanna named Rabbi Judah ben Ro'eẓ, who is not mentioned elsewhere, and of whom, consequently, nothing more is known (comp. Sanhedrin 4a). Ishmael, in opposition to Akiva, follows the principle יש אם למסורת, i.e., that the tradition regarding only the consonantal text is authoritative, and that rules may be deduced only from that text. A single example will serve to illustrate the difference between the methods of the two schools. In [[Lev.]] xxi. 11, in the law which forbids a priest to defile himself by touching a corpse, the word נפשת is written defectively. Since the traditional reading indicates the plural, "nafshot", Akiva draws the conclusion that a quarter-log of blood, the minimum quantity by which a priest may be rendered unclean through contact with a single corpse, also defiles him when it issues from two bodies. According to Ishmael, however, this minimum quantity defiles a priest only when it issues from a single corpse; for the word, according to the consonantal text, is to be read in the singular "nafshat" (comp. Sanhedrin 4a, b, [[Hullin]] 72a, and [[Tosafot]] to both passages).<ref name=je/>

===Juxtaposition of sections===
According to Akiva, laws may be deduced from the juxtaposition of two legal sections, since "every passage which stands close to another must be explained and interpreted with reference to its neighbor" (כל פרשה שהיא סמוכה לחבירתה למדה הימנה; Sifre, Num. 131). According to Ishmael, on the contrary, nothing may be inferred from the position of the individual sections, since it is not at all certain that every single portion now stands in its proper place. Many a paragraph which forms, strictly speaking, the beginning of a book and should stand in that position, has been transposed to the middle. Ishmael explains the occurrence of a section in a place where it does not properly belong (ולמה נכתב כאן) by declaring that "there is no first or last in the Scriptures" (אלא מפני שאין מקדם ומאחר בתורה), not as due to any special reason ([[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]], ed. Weiss, p.&nbsp;48a; [[Ecclesiastes Rabbah]] i.; comp. [[Pesahim]] 6b, where [[Rav Papa]] defines this principle in such a manner that it does not contradict Ishmael's rules concerning "Kelal uferat"). Eliezer ben Jose expanded this rule in his baraita ([[Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules]]) and divided it into two parts (Nos. 31 and 32).<ref name=je/>

Nonetheless, this method is utilized in many instances, for example: [[Deuteronomy]] 22:11 speaks of the commandment forbidding the wearing of [[shaatnez]], a specific mixture of [[wool]] and [[linen]]. The next verse discussed the directive to make [[tzitzit]], the fringes tied to four-cornered garments. The juxtaposition of these two verses is used to teach that the transgression of shaatnez is not violated when one wears a four cornered garment of linen bearing tzitzis of wool (the wool here is actually the thread(s) of [[tekhelet]], a blue-dyed woolen thread. While the white strings of the tzitzit could be of any material, the blue string must be wool, even when the subsequent garment would be a mixture of wool and linen.)

Juxtaposition through "exemplification" or  משל has recently been described by Talmudist [[Daniel Boyarin]] as the ''sine qua non'' of Talmudic hermeneutics (Boyarin 2003: 93), for "until Solomon invented the ''[[Mashal (allegory)|mashal]]'', no one could understand Torah at all" (''Song of Songs Rabba''). The phenomenon has been compared to the more recent phenomenon of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in modern popular music, especially hip-hop ([http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/gjtp/2010/00000018/00000002/art00004 Levy 2010]).

===Fusion of methodologies===
The opposition between the schools of Ishmael and Akiva lessened gradually, and finally vanished altogether, so that the later [[tannaim]] apply the axioms of both indiscriminately, although the hermeneutics of Akiva predominated.<ref name=je/>

== Detailed rules ==

===Kal va-chomer (קל וחומר)===
{{See also|A fortiori argument}}
The first rule of Hillel and of Rabbi Ishmael is "kal va-chomer" ({{lang-he|קל וחומר}}), called also "din" (conclusion). This is the argument "a minori ad majus" or "a majori ad minus". In the Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules this rule is divided into two (Nos. 5 and 6), since a distinction is made between a course of reasoning carried to its logical conclusion in the [[Tanakh|Holy Scriptures]] themselves ("kal va-chomer meforash") and one merely suggested there ("kal va-chomer satum"). The completed argument is illustrated in ten examples given in Genesis Rabbah xcii.<ref name=je/>

The full name of this rule should be "kal va-chomer, chomer ve-kal" (simple and complex, complex and simple), since by it deductions are made from the simple to the complex or vice versa, according to the nature of the conclusion required. The major premise on which the argument is based is called "nadon", or, at a later period, "melammed" (that which teaches); the conclusion resulting from the argument is termed בא מן הדין ("ba min ha-din", that which "comes from the rule") or, later, "lamed" (that which learns). The process of deduction in the kal va-chomer is limited by the rule that the conclusion may contain nothing more than is found in the premise. This is the so-called "dayyo" law, which many teachers, however, ignored. It is formulated thus: דיו לבא מן הדין להיות כנדון ("The conclusion of an argument is satisfied when it is like the major premise").<ref name=je/>

There is a dispute regarding the thirteen principles: Either the kal va-chomer is unique among the thirteen rules in that it may be applied by anyone in any circumstance in which it logically applies and the remaining twelve rules may only be applied with a tradition of application descending from [[Moses]] (or another authoritative legal board of the era) or all thirteen except a gezerah shava are open to all and only the latter is restricted in its application.

For example, one may make the following logical reasoning and support it using the basis of this rule: If, as a given, a parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. The reasoning is based on pure logic: if the parent is so upset about one item of clothing, surely he or she will be at least that upset about the child's entire ensemble. A somewhat easier construct would be to assert "if a junior varsity basketball player can make a [[Three-point field goal|three-pointer]], surely an excellent professional basketball player could make the same three-pointer," but this might be attacked as a poor analogy because not everyone can make every shot.

However, one must be careful of falling into the trap of an illogical deduction, as explained above by "dayyo". An example of this would be as follows: If a parent will punish his or her child with a minor punishment should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child with a major punishment should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. This is an illogical deduction; although it might be a fair speculation, it cannot be proven with logic. All that can be proven is at least the result of the lesser offense. This would be akin to asserting "if a junior varsity basketball player can make a three-pointer, surely an excellent professional basketball player could make a half-court shot."

The discovery of a fallacy in the process of deduction is called "teshuvah" (objection), or, in the terminology of the [[amoraim]], "pirka". The possibility of such an objection is never wholly excluded, hence the deduction of the kal va-chomer has no absolute certainty. The consequences of this are: (a) that the conclusions have, according to many teachers, no real value in criminal procedure, a view expressed in the axiom that the conclusion is insufficient to punish the violator of an inferred prohibition (אין עונשין מן הדין ; Sifre, Num. 1); (b) that very often a passage is interpreted to mean something which may be inferred by means of a kal va-chomer (מילתא דאתיא בק"ו טרח וכתב לה קרא ; Pesahim 18b; [[Yoma]] 43a).<ref name=je/>

An example of a situation in which transgressions are specifically not punished according to 
kal va-chomer is as follows: [[Leviticus]] 18:21 speaks of the prohibition of worshiping [[Molech]], a form of worship in which children were passed through fire (presumably until dead). Now, one would assume that if it were prohibited to pass some of one's children through the fire, surely it would be prohibited to pass ''all'' of one's children through the fire –- a kal va-chomer. However, it is derived from the verse's use of the word "ומזרעך", lit. "and from your seed", that this prohibition is only when ''some'' of one's children are sacrificed in this worship; when all of one's children are sacrificed, this is not punishable. This is explained with the reasoning that the intention of the Molech worship is to improve the health and well-being of one's remaining children, whereas complete sacrifice defeats the purported purpose of the service, rendering it unpunishable by lack of intent to perform it properly.

===Gezerah shavah (גזירה שוה)===
The ''gezerah shavah'' ("Similar laws, similar verdicts") is the second rule of Hillel and of Rabbi Ishmael, and the seventh of Eliezer ben Jose HaGelili. This may be described as argument by [[analogy]], which infers from the similarity of two cases that the legal decision given for the one holds good for the other also. The term ''gezerah shavah'' originally included arguments based on analogies either in word or in fact. Before long, however, the latter class was designated as ''hekkesh'', while the phrase ''gezerah shavah'' was limited to analogy in the case of two different Biblical laws containing a word common to both. The ''gezerah shavah'' was originally restricted to a δὶς λεγόμενον (bis legomenon), i.e., a word occurring only in the two passages offering the analogy. Since such a word is found nowhere else, there is no reason to assume that it bears different meanings in the two passages. The ''gezerah shavah'' consequently attaches to the word in the one passage the entire sequence of ideas which it bears in the other. Such a ''gezerah shavah'' is purely lexicographical, as seeking to determine the exact signification of a word by comparison with another passage in which the full meaning of such word is clear. The rule thus demonstrates itself.<ref name=je/>

An example will illustrate this more clearly. The phrase מלק את ראשו ("to wring off the head") occurs only twice in the [[Pentateuch]], namely, in Leviticus i. 15 and ib. v. 8. In the latter passage, however, the meaning of the phrase is more closely defined by ממול ערפו ("from the neck"). The Sifra (ed. Weiss, p.&nbsp;9a) concludes, therefore, that the nearer definition, "from the neck", in the second passage, is part of the concept of the word מלק, and, consequently, that in the former passage, also, מלק means "to wring the head from the neck". At a later period, however, the gezerah shavah emerged from these narrow bounds and inferred the identity of legal requirements from the identity of their terminology, even when such terminology occurred in many passages besides the two which formed the analogy. Thereby the gezerah shavah lost its inherent power of demonstration; for it is wholly unreasonable to attribute to a word a meaning which happens to be associated with it in a single passage, when various other passages connect ideas entirely different with the same word. Since, moreover, each individual teacher might choose which two expressions he would select for a ''gezerah shavah'', contradictory conclusions might be drawn, which would each have the same claim to validity, since both were obtained by a ''gezerah shavah''. Consequently, in order to be binding, a ''gezerah shavah'' was obliged to conform to two requirements which, on the one hand, greatly restricted its application, and, on the other, gave legal decisions thus obtained the value of those deduced from a superfluous word in the Holy Scriptures.<ref name=je/> These conditions are:

* אין אדם דן גזירה שוה מעצמו ("No one may draw a conclusion from analogy upon his own authority"; [[Pes.]] 66a; [[Niddah]] 19b). This rule, however, is not to be regarded as implying that every gezerah shavah must have been handed down from [[Mt. Sinai]], as [[Rashi]] (on the various passages) and many expositors who followed him explained it, but that the use of this method of hermeneutics is to be permitted only to an entire board or council, and is to be employed only when its results agree with the traditional [[halakah]], which thereby acquires the importance of a law implied in the [[Tanakh|Scriptures]]. In [[Jerusalem Talmud|Yerushalmi]] this rule reads: אדם דן גזירה שוה לקיים תלמודו ואין אדם דן גזירה שוה לבטל תלמודו  ("From a gezerah shavah conclusions may be deduced which support tradition, but not such as are opposed to tradition"; comp. [[Maimonides]] in the introduction to his ''Mishneh Torah'').<ref name=je/>
* The words of the text which form the basis of the deduction from analogy must be free, i.e., they must be superfluous and non-essential, or they may not be used (מופנה להקיש ולדין הימנו גזירה שוה). This limitation of the gezerah shavah, however, to superfluous words is not generally recognized. Akiva considers the gezerah shavah valid when neither of the two words is superfluous (אינו מופנה כלל). According to Rabbi Ishmael, it is sufficient if the analogy is free on one side (מופנה מצד אחד), i.e., if one of the two words forming the basis of the analogy is pleonastic. Rabbi Eliezer alone requires both words to be superfluous (מופנה משני צדדים; comp. [[David Zvi Hoffmann]], ''Zur Einleitung in die Halachischen Midraschim,'' p.&nbsp;6).<ref name=je/>

===Binyan ab mi-katuv echad (בנין אב מכתוב אחד)===
In "binyan ab mi-katub echad" ("A standard from a passage of Scripture") a certain passage serves as a basis for the interpretation of many others, so that the decision given in the case of one is valid for all the rest.<ref name=je/>

===Binyan ab mi-shene ketubim (בנין אב משני כתובים)===
By this rule of "binyan ab mi-shene ketubim" ("A standard from two passages of Scripture")   a decision in two laws having a characteristic in common (הצד השוה) is applied to many other laws which have this same characteristic. Rabbi Ishmael unites rules 2 and 4 in his third rule, while the same combination forms the eighth rule of Rabbi Eliezer.<ref name=je/>

===Kelal u-perat and perat u-kelal (כלל ופרט ופרט וכלל)===
The rules of "Kelal u-perat" and "perat u-kelal" ("General and particular, particular and general") is a  limitation of the general by the particular and vice versa. According to Rabbi Ishmael, this principle has eight special applications, and thus includes eight separate rules in his scheme (Nos. 4-11). This method of limitation is one of the main points of difference between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the former, who follows his teacher Rabbi [[Nehunya ben HaKanah]], the particular is only an elucidation of the preceding general expression, so that the latter includes only what is contained in the particular (כלל ופרט אין בכלל אלא מה שבפרט). But if still another general follows the particular, the two general expressions are defined by the intermediate particular, so that the law applies only to what is like the particular (כלל ופרט וכלל אי אתה מרבה אלא כעין הפרט). Akiva, on the contrary, applies the rule of increase and decrease (רבוי ומיעוט) which had been taught him by his teacher Nahum of Gimzo. According to this principle, the general followed by a particular subsumes everything which is like the particular (Sanhedrin 45b, 46a). If, however, another general term follows the particular, the former subsumes also what is not similar to the latter. The two general terms are decreased in only one respect by the intermediate particular (רבוי ומיעוט ורבוי ריבה הכל ומאי מיעט דבר אחר ; [[Shebu.]] 26a; comp. also [[Rashi]] on Sanhedrin l.c.).<ref name=je/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.primidi.com/talmudical_hermeneutics/detailed_rules/kelal_u-perat_and_perat_u-kelal_%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9C_%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%98_%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%98_%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9C|title=Talmudical Hermeneutics - Detailed Rules - Kelal U-perat and Perat U-kelal (כלל ופרט ופרט וכלל)
}}</ref>

The difference between ''kelal u-perat u-kelal'' (כלל ופרט וכלל) and ''ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui'' (רבוי ומיעוט ורבוי) is exemplified in the following example: [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:31 states ועשית מנרת זהב טהור מקשה תיעשה המנורה, "You shall make a ''[[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]'' of pure gold, hammered out shall the ''Menorah'' be made."  The repetitive fashion of the statement can be explained by the ''kelal u-perat u-kelal'' or the ''ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui''.

Whichever method of deduction is employed, the word ועשית ("You shall make") is an objective generalization, the words מנרת זהב ("pure [[gold]]") are an objective specification and the word תיעשה (shall be made") is again an objective generalization.  The rule of ''kelal u-perat u-kelal'' works to teach that anything similar to the specification is deemed appropriate, while the rule of ''ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui'' is more inclusive, allowing everything ''except'' the thing ''most dissimilar'' to the specification.

Thus, [[Rashi|Rashi's]] commentary in ''[[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|Rosh Hashanah]]'' 24b asserts that, according to the former method of learning this verse, the ''Menorah'' could, when necessary, be constructed of any metal (deemed in the same category of and thus similar to gold), whereas use of the latter method of learning would allow the ''Menorah'' to be constructed of anything but [[clay]] (deemed the material most dissimilar to gold).  This argument arose because the ''[[gemarah]]'' made reference to a wooden ''Menorah'' overlaid with [[tin]] that was constructed in the times of the ''[[Hasmonean|Chashmunaim]]'' and used in the Temple service.

===Ka-yotze bo mi-makom acher (כיוצא בו ממקום אחר)===
The rule "Ka-yotze bo mi-makom acher" ("Like that in another place") refers to explaining a Biblical passage according to another of similar content.<ref name=je/>

===Davar ha-lamed me-inyano (דבר הלמד מעניינו)===
Dabar ha-lamed me-inyano ("Something proved by the context") refers to definition from the context. Rabbi Ishmael omits rule 6 entirely, and has another (No. 13) instead which is not found in [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], and which reads thus: שני כתובים המכחישים זה את זה, עד שיבוא הכתוב השלישי ויכריע ביניהם ("If two passages contradict each other, this contradiction must be reconciled by comparison with a third passage"). The method of solution of such opposing statements by the help of a third passage is a point of divergency between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the latter, the third sentence decides in favor of one of the two contradictory statements (Mekhilta, ed. [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]], 6a); according to the former, it modifies the interpretation of both. With regard to the meaning of words which are pointed in the text, [[Simeon ben Eleazar]] laid down the rule that if the pointed part of the word (נקודה) is equal to the unpointed part (כתב) in length, the word must not be interpreted at all; but if one part is longer than the other, such part must be interpreted ([[Genesis Rabbah]] lxxviii.). Concerning the interpretation of words by a change of letters or vowels the rule is: אל תקרא ("Do not read so, but so"). Under this rule the integrity of the text itself is not assailed, the changes made being only for the purpose of explanation.<ref name=je/>

To support a [[halakic]] decision, and more especially to find a point of departure in the [[aggadah]], the traditional reading of a word is altered by transposition of its consonants or by substitution of others which are related to them, or the consonant-group is retained with alteration of its vowels, the last method being the most frequent. A halakic example of this form of hermeneutics is the interpretation of the word "kapot" (bough; [[Leviticus]] 23:40) as though it were "kaput" (bound; Sifra, ed. Weiss, p.&nbsp;102d; [[Sukkah (Talmud)|Sukkah]] 32a). It is noteworthy, moreover, that only the tannaim derived new halakot with the aid of these rules, while the [[amoraim]] employed them only in advancing haggadic explanations or in establishing the old halakhot of the Tannaim.<ref name=je>{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=Talmud Hermeneutics|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14215-talmud-hermeneutics|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Bacher|authorlink1=Wilhelm Bacher|first2=Jacob Zallel|last2=Lauterbach|authorlink2=Jacob Zallel Lauterbach|accessdate=Mar 1, 2016}}
