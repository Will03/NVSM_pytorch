{{Linguistics}}

In [[linguistics]], '''code-switching''' or '''language alternation''' occurs when a speaker alternates between two or more [[language]]s, or language [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]], in the context of a single conversation. [[Multilingualism|Multilinguals]], speakers of more than one language, sometimes use elements of multiple languages when conversing with each other. Thus, code-switching is the use of more than one linguistic variety in a manner consistent with the [[syntax]] and [[phonology]] of each variety.

Code-switching is distinct from other [[language contact]] phenomena, such as [[Loanword|borrowing]], [[pidgin]]s and [[Creole language|creoles]], [[Calque|loan translation (calques)]], and [[language transfer]] (language interference). Borrowing affects the [[lexicon]], the words that make up a language, while code-switching takes place in individual [[utterance]]s.<ref name="Gumperz">{{Cite book |last=Gumperz |first=John J. |year=1982 |title=Discourse Strategies |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUJNgHWl_koC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22code-switching%22&f=false|isbn=9780521288965 }}</ref><ref name="Poplack 1984 99–136">{{Cite journal |last=Poplack |first=Shana |author2=David Sankoff |year=1984 |title=Borrowing: the synchrony of integration |journal=Linguistics |volume=22 |pages=99–136 |issue=269 |doi=10.1515/ling.1984.22.1.99|hdl=10315/2840 }}</ref><ref name="Muysken 1995 177–98">{{Cite book |last=Muysken |first=Pieter |year=1995 |chapter=Code-switching and grammatical theory |editor=L.

In the 1940s and the 1950s, many scholars considered code-switching to be a substandard use of language.<ref name="Weinreich">{{Cite book |last=Weinreich |first=Uriel |year=1953 |title=Languages in Contact |location=The Hague |publisher=Mouton}}</ref> Since the 1980s, however, most scholars have come to regard it as a normal, natural product of bilingual and multilingual language use.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1044/0161-1461(2005/026) |last=Goldstein |first=B. |author2=Kohnert, K. |year=2005 |title=Speech, language and hearing in developing bilingual children: Current findings and future directions |journal=Language, Speech and Hearing Services in Schools |volume=36 |pages=264–67 |issue=3}}

The term "code-switching" is also used outside the field of linguistics. Some scholars of literature use the term to describe literary styles that include elements from more than one language, as in novels by Chinese-American, Anglo-Indian, or Latino writers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Torres |first=Lourdes |title=In the Contact Zone: Code-Switching Strategies by Latino/a Writers |journal=Melus |volume=32 |year=2007 |pages=75–96 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/melus/32.1.75}}</ref> In popular usage, ''code-switching'' is sometimes used to refer to relatively stable informal [[Code-mixing#As fused lect|mixtures of two languages]], such as [[Spanglish]], [[Taglish]], or [[Hinglish]].<ref name=Zentella/> Both in popular usage and in sociolinguistic study, the name code-switching is sometimes used to refer to switching among [[dialect]]s, [[style-shifting|styles]] or [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Demby|first1=Gene |title=How Code-Switching Explains The World |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/04/08/176064688/how-code-switching-explains-the-world |accessdate=20 September 2016 |date=3 April 2013}}</ref> This form of switching is practiced, for example, by speakers of [[African American Vernacular English]] as they move from less formal to more formal settings.<ref>{{Cite book |last=DeBose |first=Charles |year=1992 |chapter=Codeswitching: Black English and Standard English in the African-American linguistic repertoire |editor-last=Eastman |editor-first=Carol |title=Codeswitching |location=Clevedon |publisher=Multilingual Matters |pages=157–167 |isbn=978-1-85359-167-9}}</ref> Such shifts, when performed by public figures such as politicians, are sometimes criticized as signalling [[Authenticity (philosophy)|inauthenticity]] or insincerity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kanngieser|first=Anja|title=A sonic geography of voice: Towards an affective politics|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=36|issue=3|pages=336–353|year=2012|doi=10.1177/0309132511423969}}</ref>

==Social motivations==<!-- [[Code mixing]] links here -->

Code-switching relates to, and sometimes [[Indexicality|indexes]] social-group membership in bilingual and multilingual communities. Some sociolinguists describe the relationships between code-switching behaviours and [[Social class|class]], [[ethnicity]], and other social positions.<ref>See:

In addition, scholars in [[interactional linguistics]] and [[conversation analysis]] have studied code-switching as a means of structuring speech in interaction.<ref name="Li1998">{{Cite book |first=Li |last=Wei |authorlink= Li Wei (linguist) |year=1998|chapter=The 'Why' and 'How' Questions in the Analysis of Conversational Codeswitching |title=Code-Switching in Conversation: Language, Interaction, and Identity |editor=P.

===Markedness model===
{{main|Markedness model}}
The Markedness Model, developed by [[Carol Myers-Scotton]], is one of the more complete theories of code-switching motivations. It posits that language users are [[Rationality|rational]] and choose to speak a language that clearly marks their rights and obligations, relative to other speakers, in the conversation and its setting.<ref name="CMS1993">{{Cite book |last=Myers-Scotton |first=Carol |year=1993 |title=Social Motivations for Codeswitching: Evidence from Africa |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqD-y_IF3SwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780198239239 }}</ref> When there is no clear, [[markedness|unmarked]] language choice, speakers practice code-switching to explore possible language choices. Many sociolinguists, however, object to the Markedness Model’s postulation that language-choice is entirely rational.<ref name="Auer1998">{{Cite book |last=Auer |first=Peter |year=1998 |title=Code-Switching in Conversation |location=London |publisher=Routledge}}</ref><ref name="Woolard2004">{{Cite book |last=Woolard |first=Kathryn |authorlink=Kathryn Woolard |year=2004 |chapter=Codeswitching |editor=A. Duranti |title=A Companion to Linguistic Anthropology |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell |pages=73–94}}</ref>

===Sequential analysis===
Scholars of conversation analysis such as Peter Auer and [[Li Wei (linguist)|Li Wei]] argue that the social motivation behind code-switching lies in the way code-switching is structured and managed in conversational interaction; in other words, the question of why code-switching occurs cannot be answered without first addressing the question of how it occurs. Using conversation analysis (CA), these scholars focus their attention on the sequential implications of code-switching. That is, whatever language a speaker chooses to use for a conversational turn, or part of a turn, impacts the subsequent choices of language by the speaker as well as the hearer. Rather than focusing on the social values inherent in the languages the speaker chooses ("brought-along meaning"), the analysis concentrates on the meaning that the act of code-switching itself creates ("brought-about meaning").<ref name="Li1998"/><ref name="Auer1998"/>

===Communication accommodation theory===
The [[communication accommodation theory]] (CAT), developed by [[Howard Giles]], professor of communication at the University of California, Santa Barbara, seeks to explain the cognitive reasons for code-switching, and other changes in speech, as a person either emphasizes or minimizes the social differences between himself and the other person(s) in conversation.  Giles posits that when speakers seek approval in a social situation they are likely to converge their speech with that of the other speaker.  This can include, but is not limited to, the language of choice, accent, dialect, and para-linguistic features used in the conversation. In contrast to convergence, speakers might also engage in divergent speech, in which an individual person emphasizes the social distance between himself and other speakers by using speech with linguistic features characteristic of his own group.

===Diglossia===

In a diglossic situation, some topics are better suited to the use of one language over another.

==Types of switching==
Scholars use different names for various types of code-switching.

*'''Intersentential switching''' occurs ''outside'' the sentence or the clause level (i.e. at sentence or clause boundaries).<ref name=LiWei>{{cite book |title=The Bilingualism Reader |editor=Li Wei |place=London |publisher=Routledge |year=2000}}</ref> It is sometimes called '''"extrasentential" switching'''.<ref name=Types>{{Cite journal |last=Myers-Scotton |first=Carol |year=1989 |title=Codeswitching with English: types of switching, types of communities |journal=World Englishes |volume=8 |pages=333–346 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-971X.1989.tb00673.x |issue=3}}</ref> In Assyrian-English switching one could say, "''Ani wideili.''

*'''Intra-sentential switching''' occurs ''within'' a sentence or a clause.<ref name=LiWei/><ref name=Types/> In Spanish-English switching one could say, "''La onda'' is to fight ''y jambar.''" ("''The latest fad'' is to fight ''and steal.''")<ref name=Woolford>Woolford, Ellen. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4178342 Bilingual Code-Switching and Syntactic Theory]." Linguistic Inquiry. Vol. 14. Cambridge: MIT, 1983. 520-36. Print.</ref>
*'''Tag-switching''' is the switching of either a tag phrase or a [[word]], or both, from one language to another, (common in ''intra-sentential switches'').<ref name=LiWei/> In Spanish-English switching one could say, "''Él es de México y así los criaron a ellos,'' you know." ("''He's from Mexico, and they raise them like that,'' you know.")<ref name="Winford">Winford, Donald. "Code Switching: Linguistic Aspects." An Introduction to Contact Linguistics. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2003. 126-167. Print.</ref>
*'''Intra-word switching''' occurs ''within'' a word itself, such as at a [[morpheme]] boundary.<ref name=Types/> In [[Shona language|Shona]]-English switching one could say, "''But ma''-day-s ''a-no a-ya ha-ndi-si ku-mu-on-a.''  ("''But these'' days ''I don't see him much.''") Here the English plural morpheme -''s'' appears alongside the Shona prefix ''ma''-, which also marks plurality.<ref name=Winford/>

Most code-switching studies primarily focus on intra-sentential switching, as it creates many hybrid grammar structures that require explanation. The other types involve utterances that simply follow the grammar of one language or the other.  Intra-sentential switching can be alternational or insertional.  In alternational code-switching, a new grammar emerges that is a combination of the grammars of the two languages involved. Insertional code-switching involves "the insertion of elements from one language into the morphosyntactic frame of the other."<ref name=Winford/>

== Reasons ==
There are several reasons to switch codes in a single conversation:
* '''A particular topic:''' People generally switch codes during discourse about a particular topic, since it requires specific language; varieties related to a particular topic may be better able to convey or communicate issues surrounding it. 
* '''Quoting someone:''' People have to switch codes while quoting another person.
* '''Solidarity and gratitude:''' While expressing gratitude or solidarity, people may speak in ways that express these feelings.
* '''Clarification:''' Speakers may alter their speech when listeners have trouble understanding how they communicated a thought or idea before. Same can be said for speakers who do not know of (or don't remember) the appropriate words to use in their native language.
* '''Group identity:''' People may alter their language to express group identification. This can happen, for example, when introducing members of a particular group to others.<ref>Hult, F.M. (2014).  Covert bilingualism and symbolic competence: Analytical reflections on negotiating insider/outsider positionality in Swedish speech situations. ''Applied Linguistics, 35''(1), 63-81.</ref> 
* '''To soften or strengthen command:''' While asking someone to do something, code switching works to mark emphasis or provide inspiration. 
* '''Lexical need:''' People often use some technical terms or words written in another language. In that case, if people try to translate those words, that might distort the exact meaning and value of the word or term. In this case, code switching occurs to maintain the exact meaning of the word.

==Grammatical theories==
{{criticism section|section|date=June 2016}}
In studying the syntactic and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] patterns of language alternation, linguists have postulated specific [[Grammar|grammatical]] rules and specific syntactic boundaries for where code-switching might occur.

===Poplack's model===

[[Shana Poplack]]'s model of code-switching is the best known theory of the underlying grammar of code-switching.<ref name="Winford" /> In this model, code-switching is subject to two constraints. The ''free-morpheme constraint'' stipulates that code-switching cannot occur between a lexical stem and bound morphemes. Essentially, this constraint distinguishes code-switching from borrowing. Generally, borrowing occurs in the lexicon, while code-switching occurs at either the syntax level or the utterance-construction level.<ref name="Gumperz" /><ref name="Poplack 1984 99–136"/><ref name="Muysken 1995 177–98"/> The ''equivalence constraint'' predicts that switches occur only at points where the surface structures of the languages coincide, or between sentence elements that are normally ordered in the same way by each individual grammar.<ref name="Winford" /> For example, the sentence: "I like you ''porque eres simpático''" ("I like you ''because you are nice''") is allowed because it obeys the syntactic rules of both Spanish and English.<ref name="SanPop1981">{{Cite journal |last=Sankoff |first=David |author2=Shana Poplack |year=1981 |title=A formal grammar for code-switching |journal=Papers in Linguistics |volume=14 |pages=3–45 |issue=1–4 |doi=10.1080/08351818109370523|citeseerx=10.1.1.667.3175 }}</ref> Cases like the noun phrases ''the casa white'' and ''the blanca house'' are ruled out because the combinations are ungrammatical in at least one of the languages involved. Spanish noun phrases are made up of determiners, then nouns, then adjectives, while the adjectives come before the nouns in English noun phrases. ''The casa white'' is ruled out by the equivalence constraint because it does not obey the syntactic rules of English, and ''the blanca house'' is ruled out because it does not follow the syntactic rules of Spanish.<ref name="Winford" />

Critics cite weaknesses of Sankoff and Poplack's model. The free-morpheme and equivalence constraints are insufficiently restrictive, meaning there are numerous exceptions that occur. For example, the free morpheme constraint does not account for why switching is impossible between certain free morphemes. The sentence: "The students had ''visto la película italiana''" ("The students had ''seen the Italian movie''") does not occur in Spanish-English code-switching, yet the free-morpheme constraint would seem to posit that it can.<ref name="Belazi">{{Cite journal |last=Belazi |first=Heidi |author2=Edward Rubin |author3=Almeida Jacqueline Toribio  |year=1994 |title=Code switching and X-Bar theory: The functional head constraint |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=25 |pages=221–37 |issue=2}}</ref> The equivalence constraint would also rule out switches that occur commonly in languages, as when Hindi postpositional phrases are switched with English prepositional phrases like in the sentence:  "John gave a book ''ek larakii ko''" ("John gave a book ''to a girl''"). The phrase ''ek larakii ko'' is literally translated as ''a girl to,'' making it ungrammatical in English, and yet this is a sentence that occurs in English-Hindi code-switching despite the requirements of the equivalence constraint.<ref name="Winford" /> The Sankoff and Poplack model only identifies points at which switching is blocked, as opposed to explaining which [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] can be switched and why.<ref name="Winford" />

===Matrix language-frame model===
{{technical|section|date=November 2013}}
[[Carol Myers-Scotton]]'s Matrix Language-Frame (MLF) model is the dominant model of insertional code-switching.<ref name="Winford" /> The MLF model posits that there is a '''Matrix Language''' (ML) and an '''Embedded Language''' (EL). In this case, elements of the Embedded Language are inserted into the morphosyntactic frame of the Matrix Language. The hypotheses are as follows (Myers-Scotton 1993b: 7):

The Matrix Language Hypothesis states that those grammatical procedures in the central structure in the language production system which account for the surface structure of the Matrix Language + Embedded Language [[constituent (linguistics)]] are only Matrix Language–based procedures. Further, the hypothesis is intended to imply that frame-building precedes content [[morpheme]] insertion. A Matrix Language can be the first language of the speaker or the language in which the morphemes or words are more frequently used in speech, so the dominant language is the Matrix Language and the other is the Embedded Language. A '''Matrix Language island''' is a constituent composed entirely of Matrix Language morphemes.<ref>Scotton, Carol. Duelling languages: grammatical structure in codeswitching. Oxford, Eng.: Clarendon Press ;, 1993. Print.</ref>

According to the '''Blocking Hypothesis''', in Matrix Language + Embedded Language constituents, a blocking filter blocks any Embedded Language content morpheme which is not congruent with the Matrix Language with respect to three levels of abstraction regarding subcategorization. "Congruence" is used in the sense that two entities, linguistic categories in this case, are congruent if they correspond in respect of relevant qualities.

The three levels of abstraction are:
* Even if the Embedded Language realizes a given grammatical category as a content morpheme, if it is realized as a system morpheme in the Matrix Language, the Matrix Language blocks the occurrence of the Embedded Language content morpheme. (A content morpheme is often called an "open-class" morpheme, because they belong to categories that are open to the invention of arbitrary new items. They can be made-up words like "smurf", "nuke", "byte", etc. and can be nouns, verbs, adjectives, and some prepositions. A system morpheme, e.g. function words and inflections, expresses the relation between content morphemes and does not assign or receive thematic roles.)
* The Matrix Language also blocks an Embedded Language content morpheme in these constituents if it is not congruent with a Matrix Language content morpheme counterpart in terms of [[theta role]] assignment. 
*Congruence between Embedded Language content morphemes and Matrix Language content morphemes is realized in terms of their discourse or [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] functions.

;Examples
# Hindi/English
#* life ko face kiijiye with himmat and faith in apane aap. (Code-switching) 
#* "Face life with courage and faith in self." (Translation) 
# Swahili/English
#* hata wengine nasikia washawekwa cell. (Code-switching) 
#* "Even others I heard were put [in] cells." (Translation)

We see that example 1 is consistent with the Blocking Hypothesis and the system content morpheme criteria, so the prediction is that the Hindi equivalents are also content morphemes. Sometimes non-congruence between counterparts in the Matrix Language and Embedded Language can be circumvented by accessing bare forms. "Cell" is a bare form and so the thematic role of "cell" is assigned by the verb ''-wek-'' 'put in/on'; this means that the verb is a content morpheme.

The '''Embedded Language Island Trigger Hypothesis''' states that when an Embedded Language morpheme appears which is not permitted under either the Matrix Language Hypothesis or Blocking Hypothesis, it triggers the inhibition of all Matrix Language accessing procedures and completes the current constituent as an Embedded Language island. Embedded Language islands consist only of Embedded Language morphemes and are well-formed by Embedded Language grammar, but they are inserted in the Matrix Language frame. Therefore, Embedded Language islands are under the constraint of Matrix Language grammar.

;Examples
# Swahili/English
#* *Sikuona your barau ambayo uliipoteza. (Code-switching ungrammatical) 
#* "I didn't see your letter which you lost." (Translation)
# Swahili/English 
#* *Nikamwambia anipe ruhusa niende ni-ka-check for wewe. (Code-switching, ungrammatical) 
#* "And I told him he should give me permission so that I go and check for you." (Translation)
#* Nikamwambia anipe ruhusa niende ni-ka-check for you. (Code-switching, grammatical)

Example 1 is ungrammatical (indicated by the leading asterisk) because "your" is accessed, so the Embedded Language Island Trigger Hypothesis predicts that it must be followed by an English head (e.g., "your letter") as an Embedded Language island. The reason is that possessive adjectives are system morphemes. We see the same thing happen in example 2, which is therefore ungrammatical. However, the correct way to finish the sentence is not "for wewe", switching back to Swahili; rather, it should end with "for you", which would be an Embedded Language island.

The '''Embedded Language Implicational Hierarchy Hypothesis''' can be stated as two sub-hypotheses: 
# The farther a constituent is from the main arguments of the sentence, the freer it is to appear as an Embedded Language island. 
# The more formulaic in structure a constituent is, the more likely it is to appear as an Embedded Language island. Stated more strongly, choice of any part of an idiomatic expression will result in an Embedded Language island.<ref name="Winford" />

The '''Implication Hierarchy of Embedded Language Islands''':
# Formulaic expressions and [[idioms]] (especially prepositional phrases expressing time and manner, but also as verb phrase complements)
# Other time and manner expressions
# [[Quantifier (linguistics)|Quantifier]] expressions
# Non-quantifier, non-time [[noun phrase]]s as [[verb phrase]] complements
# [[Agent (grammar)|Agent]] Noun phrases
# [[Theme (linguistics)|Theme]] role and case assigners, i.e. main finite verbs (with full [[inflections]])

;Examples
# Wolof/French
#* Le matin de bonne heure ngay joge Medina pour dem juilli. Suba tee nga fa war a joge. (Code-switching)
#* "Early in the morning you leave Medina to go to pray. Early in the morning you should leave then." (Translation)
# Swahili/English
#* Ulikuwa ukiongea a lot of nonsense. (Code-switching)
#* "You were talking a lot of nonsense." (Translation)

We see example 1 work because the French Embedded Language island ''Le matin de bonne heure'', "early in the morning", is a time expression. (Also, it is repeated in Wolof in the second sentence.) In example 2, we see the quantifier ''a lot of'' is a predicted Embedded Language island. Here we see an objective complement of a finite verb begin with the quantifier.

===Constraint-free===
[[Jeff MacSwan]] has posited a ''constraint-free approach'' to analyzing code-switching. This approach views explicit reference to code-switching in grammatical analysis as [[tautology (logic)|tautological]], and seeks to explain specific instances of grammaticality in terms of the unique contributions of the grammatical properties of the languages involved. MacSwan characterizes the approach with the refrain, "Nothing constrains code-switching apart from the requirements of the mixed grammars."<ref name=Jeff>MacSwan, Jeff (2000). "The architecture of the bilingual language faculty: Evidence from codeswitching". Bilingualism: Language and Cognition 3 (1): 37–54.</ref> The approach focuses on the repudiation of any rule or principle which explicitly refers to code-switching itself.<ref name=MacSwan>MacSwan, Jeff (2013). "Code-switching and grammatical theory". In T. Bhatia and W. Ritchie. Handbook of Multilingualism (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Blackwell.</ref> This approach does not recognize or accept terms such as "matrix language", "embedded language", or "language frame", which are typical in constraint-based approaches such as the MLF Model.

Rather than posit constraints specific to language alternation, as in traditional work in the field, MacSwan advocates that mixed utterances be analyzed with a focus on the specific and unique linguistic contributions of each language found in a mixed utterance.  Because these analyses draw on the full range of linguistic theory, and each data set presents its own unique challenges, a much broader understanding of linguistics is generally needed to understand and participate in this style of codeswitching research.

For example, Cantone and MacSwan (2009)<ref name=Cantone>{{cite book| last1=Cantone| first1=K. F.| last2=MacSwan| first2=J. |date=2009 |chapter= The syntax of DP-internal codeswitching |pages= 243–278 |editor1-last=Isurin |editor1-first=L. |editor1-link= |editor2-last=Winford |editor2-first=D. |editor2-link= |editor3-last=de Bot |editor3-first=K. |editor3-link= |title=Multidisciplinary Approaches to Codeswitching |location=Amsterdam |publisher=John Benjamins}}</ref> analyzed word order differences for nouns and adjectives in Italian-German codeswitching using a typological theory of Cinque that had been independently proposed in the syntax literature; their account derives the word order facts of Italian-German codeswitching from underlying differences between the two languages, according to Cinque's theory.{{citation needed | reason= Who is Cinque?

===Controversies===
Much remains to be done before a more complete understanding of code-switching phenomena is achieved. Linguists continue to debate apparent counter-examples to proposed code-switching theories and constraints.<ref name=Bokamba /><ref name="Winford" /><ref name=Bhatt>{{cite book| last=Bhatt |first=Rakesh M. |date=1995 |chapter=Code-switching and the functional head constraint| editor=Janet Fuller |display-editors=etal |title=Proceedings of the Eleventh Eastern States Conference on Linguistics |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics |pages=1–12}}</ref>

The ''Closed-class Constraint'', developed by [[Aravind Joshi]], posits that [[closed class]] items (pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, etc.) cannot be switched.<ref name=Joshi>{{cite book| last=Joshi |first=Aravind |date=1985 |chapter=How much context-sensitivity is necessary for assigning structural descriptions: Tree adjoining grammars |editor1-last=Dowty |editor1-first=D. |editor1-link=David Dowty |editor2-last=Karttunen |editor2-first=L. |editor2-link=Lauri Karttunen |editor3-last=Zwicky |editor3-first=A. |editor3-link=Arnold Zwicky |title=Natural Language Parsing |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press }}</ref> The ''Functional Head Constraint'' developed by Belazi et al. holds that code-switching cannot occur between a [[Function word|functional]] [[Head (linguistics)|head]] (a [[complementizer]], a [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiner]], an [[inflection]], etc.) and its complement (sentence, noun-phrase, verb-phrase).<ref name="Belazi" /> These constraints, among others like the Matrix Language-Frame model, are controversial among linguists positing alternative theories, as they are seen to claim universality and make general predictions based upon specific presumptions about the nature of syntax.<ref name="Bokamba" /><ref name="Bhatt" />

Myers-Scotton and MacSwan debated the relative merits of their approaches in a series of exchanges published in 2005 in ''[[Bilingualism: Language and Cognition]]'', issues 8(1) and 8(2).

==Examples==
In this section, segments that are switched from the primary language of the conversation are shown in red.

===Spanish and English===
Researcher [[Ana Celia Zentella]] offers this example from her work with Puerto Rican Spanish-English bilingual speakers in New York City.<ref name="Zentella">{{Cite book |last=Zentella |first=Ana Celia |year=1997 |title=Growing Up Bilingual |location=Malden, MA |publisher=Blackwell}}</ref> In this example, {{Smallcaps|Marta}} and her younger sister, {{Smallcaps|Lolita}}, speak Spanish and English with {{Smallcaps|Zentella}} outside of their apartment building.
:{{Smallcaps|Lolita}}: Oh, I could stay with Ana?
:{{Smallcaps|Marta}}: — but you could ask <span style="color:red">''papi''</span> and <span style="color:red">''mami''</span> to see if you could come down.
:{{Smallcaps|Lolita}}: OK.
:{{Smallcaps|Marta}}: Ana, if I leave her here would you send her upstairs when you leave?
:{{Smallcaps|Zentella}}: I’ll tell you exactly when I have to leave, at ten o’clock. <span style="color:red">''Y son las nueve y cuarto.''</span> ("And it’s nine fifteen.")
:{{Smallcaps|Marta}}: Lolita, <span style="color:red">''te voy a dejar con Ana.''</span> ("I’m going to leave you with Ana.") Thank you, Ana.

Zentella explains that the children of the predominantly Puerto Rican neighbourhood speak both English and Spanish: "Within the children’s network, English predominated, but code-switching from English to Spanish occurred once every three minutes, on average."<ref name="Zentella"/>

===French and Tamil===
This example of switching from [[French language|French]] to [[Tamil language|Tamil]] comes from [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] Sonia Das's work with immigrants from [[Jaffna]], [[Sri Lanka]], to [[Quebec]].<ref name="Das">{{Cite journal |last=Das |first=Sonia |title=Rewriting the past and reimagining the future: The social life of a Tamil heritage language industry |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=774–789 |year=2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-1425.2011.01336.x}}</ref>

<!-- Non-standard French as given in the original; please do not correct it to standard French. -->
:{{Smallcaps|Selvamani}}: {{As written|Parce que n’importe quand quand j’enregistre ma voix ça l’{{sic|aire|hide=yes}} d’un garçon.}} ([in French] "Because whenever I record my voice I sound like a guy.")
::::Alors, {{As written|TSÉ, je me {{sic|ferrai|hide=yes}} pas poigné}}  ("So, you know, I’m not going to be had.")
:[laughter]
:{{Smallcaps|Selvamani}}: <span style="color:red">''ennatā, ennatā, enna romba ciritā?''</span> ([in Tamil] "What, what, what's so funny?")
::::Alors, qu’est-ce que je disais? ([in French] "So, what was I saying?")

{{Smallcaps|Selvamani}}, who moved from Sri Lanka to Quebec as a child and now identifies as [[Québécois (word)|Québécois]], speaks to Das in French. When Selvamani's sister, Mala, laughs, {{Smallcaps|Selvamani}} switches to Tamil to ask Mala why she is laughing. After this aside, {{Smallcaps|Selvamani}} continues to speak in French. {{Smallcaps|Selvamani}} also uses the word ''tsé'' ("you know", contraction of ''tu sais'') and the expression ''je me {{sic|ferrai|hide=yes}} pas poigné'' ("I will not be handled"), which are not standard French but are typical of the working-class Montreal dialect [[Joual]].<ref name="Das" />

===Hopi and Tewa===
Researcher [[Paul Kroskrity]] offers the following example of code-switching by {{Smallcaps|three elder [[Arizona Tewa]] men}}, who are trilingual in [[Tewa language|Tewa]], [[Hopi language|Hopi]], and [[English language|English]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kroskrity |first=Paul V |year=2000 |chapter=Language ideologies in the expression and representation of Arizona Tewa identity |editor=P. V. Kroskrity |title=Regimes of Language: Ideologies, Polities, and Identities |pages=329–59 |location=Santa Fe, New Mexico |publisher=[[School of American Research Press]]}}</ref> They are discussing the selection of a site for a new high school in the eastern [[Hopi Reservation]]:
:{{Smallcaps|Speaker A}}: <span style="color:red">''Tututqaykit qanaanawakna.''</span> ([in Hopi] "Schools were not wanted.")
:{{Smallcaps|Speaker B}}: Wédít’ókánk’egena’adi imbí akhonidi. ([in Tewa] "They didn’t want a school on their land.")
:{{Smallcaps|Speaker C}}: Naembí eeyae nąeląemo díbít’ó’ámmí kąayį’į wédimu::di. ([in Tewa] "It’s better if our children go to school right here, rather than far away.")

In their two-hour conversation, the {{Smallcaps|three men}} primarily speak Tewa; however, when {{Smallcaps|Speaker A}} addresses the Hopi Reservation as a whole, he code-switches to Hopi. His speaking Hopi when talking of Hopi-related matters is a conversational norm in the Arizona Tewa speech community. Kroskrity reports that these Arizona Tewa men, who [[culturally]] identify themselves as Hopi ''and'' Tewa, use the different languages to linguistically construct and maintain their discrete ethnic identities.
