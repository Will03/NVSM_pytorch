In [[linguistics]], '''diglossia''' ({{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|ɡ|l|ɒ|s|i|ə}}) is a situation in which two [[dialects]] or [[languages]] are used by a single language community. In addition to the community's everyday or [[vernacular]] language variety (labeled "L" or "low" variety), a second, highly codified variety (labeled "H" or "high") is used in certain situations such as literature, formal education, or other specific settings, but not used for ordinary conversation.<ref name=Ferguson>{{cite journal|last=Ferguson |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles A. Ferguson |year=1959 |title=Diglossia |journal=Word |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=325–340 |doi=10.1080/00437956.1959.11659702 }}</ref> In most cases, the H variety has no native speakers.

The high variety may be an older stage of the same language (as in medieval Europe, where Latin remained in formal use even as [[Romance languages|colloquial speech]] diverged), an unrelated language, or a distinct yet closely related present day dialect (e.g. [[Standard German]] alongside [[Low German]]; or [[Chinese language|Chinese]], with [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as the official, literary standard and local [[varieties of Chinese]] used in everyday communication). Other examples include literary [[Katharevousa]] versus spoken [[Demotic Greek]]; literary [[Tamil language|Tamil]] versus spoken Tamil and Indonesian, with its ''Baku'' and ''Gaul'' forms;<ref>{{cite journal|first=James N.|last=Sneddon|title=Diglossia in Indonesian|journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|volume=159|issue=4|year=2003|pages=519–549}}</ref> and [[Literary Welsh morphology|literary]] versus [[Colloquial Welsh morphology|spoken]] [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

The [[Garifuna language]] is unusual in that it has gender-based diaglossia, with men and women having different words for the same concepts.

== Etymology ==

The [[Greek language|Greek]] word διγλωσσία (''diglōssia'') normally refers to bilingualism in general, but was first used in the specialized meaning explained by [[Emmanuel Rhoides]] in the prologue of his ''Parerga'' in 1885.  The term was immediately adapted into [[French language|French]] as ''diglossie'' by the Greek linguist and [[Demotic Greek|demoticist]] [[Ioannis Psycharis]], with credit to Rhoides. The [[Arabist]] [[William Marçais]] used the term in 1930 to describe the linguistic situation in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking countries. The [[sociolinguist]] Charles A. Ferguson introduced the English equivalent ''diglossia'' in 1959, using the word as the title of an article. The article has become such a classic that it has been cited over 4,000 times according to [[Google scholar]].<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=ferguson+diglossia&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C44&as_sdtp= Google scholar citation]</ref>

==Language registers and types of diglossia==
<!--Endoglossia and Exoglossia redirect here -->

In his 1959 article, [[Charles A. Ferguson]] defines diglossia as follows:

{{quote|DIGLOSSIA is a relatively stable language situation in which, in addition to the primary dialects of the language (which may include a standard or regional standards), there is a very divergent, highly codified (often grammatically more complex) superposed variety, the vehicle of a large and respected body of written literature, either of an earlier period or in another speech community, which is learned largely by formal education and is used for most written and formal spoken purposes but is not used by any sector of the community for ordinary conversation.<ref name=Ferguson />}}

Here, diglossia is seen as a kind of [[bilingualism]] in a society in which one of the languages has high prestige (henceforth referred to as "H"), and another of the languages has low prestige ("L"). In Ferguson's definition, the high and low variants are always closely related.

Ferguson gives the example of standardized Arabic and says that, "very often, educated Arabs will maintain they never use L at all, in spite of the fact that direct observation shows that they use it constantly in ordinary conversation" <ref name="Ferguson" />

[[Joshua Fishman]] expanded the definition of diglossia to include the use of unrelated languages as high and low varieties.<ref name=Fishman>{{cite journal|last=Fishman |first=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Fishman |title=Bilingualism with and without diglossia; diglossia with and without bilingualism |year=1967 |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=29–38 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1967.tb00573.x}}</ref> For example, in [[Alsace]] the [[Alsatian language]] (Elsässisch) serves as (L) and [[French language|French]] as (H). [[Heinz Kloss]] calls the (H) variant ''exoglossia'' and the (L) variant ''endoglossia''.<ref>{{cite conference |first=Heinz |last=Kloss |author-link=Heinz Kloss |title=Notes concerning a language-nation typology |pages=69–85 |book-title=Language Problems of Developing Nations |editor-first=Joshua A. |editor-last=Fishman |editor-first2=Charles A. |editor-last2=Ferguson |editor-first3=Jyotirindra |editor-last3=Das Gupta |publisher=Wiley |year=1968}}</ref>

In some cases (especially with [[creole languages]]), the nature of the connection between (H) and (L) is not one of diglossia but a [[Post-creole speech continuum|continuum]]; for example, [[Jamaican Creole]] as (L) and Standard [[English language|English]] as (H) in Jamaica.

(H) is usually the written language whereas (L) is the spoken language. In formal situations, (H) is used; in informal situations, (L) is used. Sometimes, (H) is used in informal situations and as spoken language when speakers of 2 different (L) languages and dialects or more communicate each other (as [[lingua franca]]), but not the other way around.

One of the earliest examples was that of [[Middle Egyptian]], the language in everyday use in Ancient Egypt during the Middle Kingdom (2000 - 1650 BC). By 1350 BC, in the New Kingdom (1550 -1050 BC), the Egyptian language had evolved into [[Late Egyptian]], which itself later evolved into [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] (700 BC - AD 400). These two later forms served as (L) languages in their respective periods. But in both cases, Middle Egyptian remained the standard written, prestigious form, the (H) language, and was still used for this purpose until the fourth century AD, more than sixteen centuries after it had ceased to exist in everyday speech.

Another historical example is Latin, [[Classical Latin]] being the (H) and [[Vulgar Latin]] the (L); the latter, which is almost completely unattested in text, is the tongue from which the [[Romance languages]] descended.

The (L) variants are not just simplifications or "corruptions" of the (H) variants. In phonology, for example, (L) dialects are as likely to have phonemes absent from the (H) as vice versa. Some [[Swiss German]] dialects have three phonemes, /e/, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/æ/}}, in the phonetic space where Standard German has only two phonemes, {{IPA|/ɛ(ː)/}} (''Berlin'' 'Berlin', ''Bären'' 'bears') and {{IPA|/eː/}} (''Beeren'' 'berries'). Jamaican Creole has fewer vowel phonemes than standard English, but it has additional palatal {{IPA|/kʲ/}} and {{IPA|/ɡʲ/}} phonemes.

Especially in endoglossia the (L) form may also be called "[[basilect]]", the (H) form "[[acrolect]]", and an intermediate form "[[mesolect]]".

Ferguson's classic examples include Standard German/Swiss German, Standard [[Arabic language|Arabic]]/[[varieties of Arabic|Arabic vernacular]]s, Standard French/[[Haitian Creole language|Creole]] in Haiti, and [[Katharevousa]]/[[Modern Greek|Dimotiki]] in [[Greece]].<ref name=Ferguson /> Creole is now recognized as a standard language in Haiti. Swiss German dialects are hardly languages with low prestige in Switzerland (see Chambers, Sociolinguistic Theory).{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} And after the end of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|military regime]] in 1974, Dimotiki was made into Greece's only standard language (1976). Nowadays, Katharevousa is (with a few exceptions) no longer used. Harold Schiffman writes about Swiss German: "it seems to be the case that Swiss German was once consensually agreed to be in a diglossic hierarchy with Standard German, but that this consensus is now breaking."<ref>{{cite web|author=Schiffman, Harold. |title=Classical and extended diglossia |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/messeas/diglossia/node6.html |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref> There is also common [[code-switching]] especially in the Arabic world; according to Andrew Freeman this is "different from Ferguson's description of diglossia which states that the two forms are in complementary distribution."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.innerbrat.org/Andyf/Articles/Diglossia/digl_96.htm |title=Andrew Freeman's Perspectives on Arabic Diglossia |author=Freeman, Andrew |date=9 December 1996 |work=Andy Freeman's Homepage |accessdate=8 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527030448/http://innerbrat.org/Andyf/Articles/Diglossia/digl_96.htm |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2010}}</ref> To a certain extent, there is code switching and overlap in all diglossic societies, even German-speaking Switzerland.

Examples where the High/Low dichotomy is justified in terms of social prestige include [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]] as (L) and [[Italian language|Standard Italian]] as (H) in Italy and German dialects and standard German in Germany. In Italy and Germany, those speakers who still speak non-standard dialects typically use those dialects in informal situations, especially in the family. In German-speaking Switzerland, on the other hand, Swiss German dialects are to a certain extent even used in schools and to a larger extent in churches. Ramseier calls German-speaking Switzerland's diglossia a "medial diglossia", whereas Felicity Rash prefers "functional diglossia".<ref>{{cite book|last=Rash |first=Felicity |year=1998 |title=The German Language in Switzerland: Multilingualism, Diglossia and Variation |location=Berne |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=0-8204-3413-2}}</ref> Paradoxically, Swiss German offers both the best example of diglossia (all speakers are native speakers of Swiss German and thus diglossic) and the worst, because there is no clear-cut hierarchy.

In most African countries, a European language serves as the official, prestige language, and local languages are used in everyday life outside formal situations. For example, [[Wolof language|Wolof]] is the everyday ''lingua franca'' in Senegal, French being spoken only in very formal situations; English is spoken in formal situations in Nigeria, native languages like [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] are spoken in ordinary conversations. However, a European language that serves as an official language is also spoken in informal situations if speakers of 2 different languages or more communicate each other. In [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], standard [[Standard French|European French]] is the prestige language used in business, politics, etc. while [[african French#Abidjan French vocabulary|Ivorian French]] is the daily language in the street, on the markets, and informal situations in general; in Mozambique, standard [[European Portuguese]] is the language used in the formal situations, while [[Mozambican Portuguese]] is the spoken language in the informal situations; [[British English]] is the language used in the formal situations in Nigeria, while [[Nigerian English]] is the spoken language in the informal situations. In the countryside, local African dialects prevail. However, in traditional events, local languages can be used as prestige dialects : for example, a wedding ceremony between two young urban Baoulés with poor knowledge of the Baoulé language would require the presence of elder family members as interpreters in the Baoulé language so as to conduct the ceremony in that language and not in French. There are European languages in Africa, particularly North Africa, without official status that are used as prestige language: for example, in Morocco, while Modern Standard Arabic is the only official language and used in formal situations and Moroccan dialects are spoken in informal situations, French and Spanish are also spoken in formal situations by code-switching, and educated Moroccans are simultaneous bilinguals/trilinguals in Modern Standard Arabic and French/Spanish, with Moroccan dialects.

===Gender-based diglossia===

In Ghana, a language called ‘Student pidgin" is traditionally used by men (this "masculine code" is, despite disapproval, found to be used by female students due to social change)<ref>https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_url?url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jane_Sunderland/publication/290978203_Language_and_gender_in_African_contexts_Towards_a_research_agenda/links/57091ba308ae8883a1fa4ed7/Language-and-gender-in-African-contexts-Towards-a-research-agenda&hl=en&sa=X&scisig=AAGBfm2hfGTJeg5JRStg3x5mCdO5CM4dJQ&nossl=1&oi=scholarr</ref>. 

Gender-based oral speech variations are found in Arabic-speaking communities. Makkan males  are found to adopt more formal linguistic
variants in their WhatsApp messages than their female counterparts, who prefer to use informal "locally prestigious" linguistic variants<ref>http://cla-acl.ca/wp-content/uploads/Azhari.pdf</ref>. 



==Greek diglossia==
[[Greek language question|Greek diglossia]] belongs to the category whereby, while the living language of the area evolves and changes as time passes by, there is an artificial retrospection to and imitation of earlier (more ancient) linguistic forms preserved in writing and considered to be scholarly and classic.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Apanta (Άπαντα) (vol.5)|last = Triandaphyllidis|first = Manolis|publisher = Aristotle University, Institute for Modern Greek Studies (Manolis Triandaphyllidis Foundation)|year = 1963|isbn = |location = Thessaloniki|pages = 491}}</ref> One of the earliest recorded examples of diaglossia was during the first century AD, when Hellenistic Alexandrian scholars decided that, in order to strengthen the link between the people and the glorious culture of the [[Classical Greece|Greek “Golden Age”]] (5th c. BC), people should adopt the language of that era. The phenomenon, called “[[Atticism]]”, dominated the writings of part of the [[Hellenistic_Greece|Hellenistic period]], the [[Byzantine Greece|Byzantine]] and Medieval era. Following the [[Greek War of Independence]] of 1821 and in order to “cover new and immediate needs” making their appearance with “the creation of the Greek State”,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Ελληνοϊνδικά Μελετήματα|last = Σετάτος|first = Μιχάλης|publisher = Κωνσταντινίδης|year = 1969|isbn = |location = Θεσσαλονίκη|pages = 15}}</ref> scholars brought to life “Κatharevousa” or “purist” language. Katharevousa did not constitute the natural development of the language of the people, the “[[Koine Greek|Koine]]”,  “Romeika”, [[Demotic Greek]] or Dimotiki as it is currently referred to. It constituted an attempt to purify the language from vulgar forms such as words of foreign origin, especially Turkish and Slavic languages, but also French or Italian and substitute them with ancient Attic forms and even by reaching down to Homeric ''cleansed'' and ''refined'' words.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Sociolinguistics ==
As an aspect of study of the relationships between codes and [[social structure]], diglossia is an important concept in the field of [[sociolinguistics]]. At the social level, each of the two dialects has certain spheres of social interaction assigned to it and in the assigned spheres it is the only socially acceptable dialect (with minor exceptions). At the grammatical level, differences may involve pronunciation, [[inflection]], and/or [[syntax]] (sentence structure). Differences can range from minor (although conspicuous) to extreme. In many cases of diglossia, the two dialects are so divergent that they are distinct languages as defined by [[linguistics|linguists]]: they are not [[mutually intelligible]].

Thomas Ricento, an author on language policy and political theory believes that there is always a "socially constructed hierarchy, indexed from low to high." <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ricento|first1=Thomas|title=Political economy and English as a 'global' language|journal=Critical Multilingualism Studies|date=2012|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31-56|url=http://cms.arizona.edu/index.php/multilingual/article/view/11/30|access-date=2017-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304114108/http://cms.arizona.edu/index.php/multilingual/article/view/11/30|archive-date=2017-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref> The hierarchy is generally imposed by leading political figures or popular media and is sometimes not the native language of that particular region. The dialect that is the original [[mother tongue]] is almost always of low [[prestige dialect|prestige]]. Its spheres of use involve informal, interpersonal [[communication]]: conversation in the home, among friends, in marketplaces. In some diglossias, this vernacular dialect is virtually unwritten. Those who try to use it in literature may be severely criticized or even persecuted. The other dialect is held in high esteem and is devoted to written communication and formal spoken communication, such as university instruction, primary education, sermons, and speeches by government officials. It is usually not possible to acquire proficiency in the formal, "high" dialect without formal study of it. Thus in those [[diglossic]] societies which are also characterized by extreme [[economic inequality|inequality]] of [[social classes]], most people are not proficient in speaking the high dialect, and if the high dialect is grammatically different enough, as in the case of Arabic diglossia, these uneducated classes cannot understand most of the [[public speeches]] that they might hear on television and radio. The high prestige dialect (or language) tends to be the more formalised, and its forms and vocabulary often 'filter down' into the vernacular though often in a changed form.

In many diglossic areas, there is controversy and [[Attitude polarization|polarization]] of opinions of native speakers regarding the relationship between the two dialects and their respective [[Social status|statuses]]. In cases that the "high" dialect is objectively not [[Mutual intelligibility|intelligible]] to those exposed only to the [[vernacular]], some people insist that the two dialects are nevertheless a common language. The pioneering scholar of diglossia, [[Charles A. Ferguson]], observed that [[native speakers]] proficient in the high prestige dialect will commonly try to avoid using the vernacular dialect with foreigners and may even deny its existence even though the vernacular is the only socially appropriate one for themselves to use when speaking to their relatives and friends. Yet another common attitude is that the low dialect, which is everyone's [[native language]], ought to be abandoned in favor of the high dialect, which presently is nobody's native language.

== 'Critical diglossia' and 'lifestyle diglossia' ==

Mukul Saxena has taken the term "diglossia" and applied it to different data, adding both a critical perspective from the Sociolinguistics of Periphery and also making a distinction between linguistic capital and language capital. It is too soon to tell whether this will become a widely used application of "diglossia".

‘Critical diglossia’,<ref name="Saxena, Mukul 2014 Pages 91">Saxena, Mukul (2014) “Critical diglossia” and “lifestyle diglossia”: development and the interaction between multilingualism, cultural diversityand English. International Journal of the Sociology of Language. Volume 2014, Issue 225, Pages 91–112, ISSN (Online) 1613–3668, ISSN (Print) 0165-2516</ref> a revised notion of diglossia, underpins the state sponsored ideological dimension of the High and Low functional distribution of languages and the attitudes towards languages. In contrast to the language-centric notion of classical diglossia, the revised notion contends that diglossia is primarily a socio-cultural, economic and political phenomenon not necessarily accepted as a natural state of affairs by all the minority groups, the speakers of Low languages/varieties. Critical diglossia not only describes how language varieties and languages in a particular linguistic market are functionally distributed in formal and informal domains and their linguistic and language capitals are valued as High and Low, but also studies the reasons why the asymmetrical relationship between the language varieties and languages develops, as well as the role that historical and current political, economic and socio-cultural processes play in its construction.

While it draws on the earlier contribution of sociolinguistics of periphery in acknowledging diglossia as imposed from above, it goes further in incorporating the role of agency as proposed in another revised concept, ‘lifestyle diglossia’.<ref name="Saxena, Mukul 2014 Pages 91" /> Lifestyle diglossia contends how and why diglossia can also develop from below in the way individuals’ everyday socio-cultural practices and projection of identities shape their language practices.

Alternative lifestyles reflected in these practices are facilitated by the unprecedented nature of the flows of ideas, people, goods and language practices that are associated with 21st century globalization. This focus on people’s everyday practices allows for observing the language choices people make as inextricably linked to their chosen lifestyles. By capturing the micro-level practices, the ‘lifestyle diglossia’ suggests that people actively project their group affiliations and individuality by drawing on the global flows of lifestyles and local structural arrangements.

For example, when German speakers use English, they are doing more than speaking a foreign language. According to Passmore: <blockquote>The use of English doesn’t express some asymmetrical power relationship between German and English, nor is it related to class or race or whatnot. Sure, there are poseurs, but it’s stupid to think Germans who can speak the language of cars in English because they race them or the language of music because they consume and/or play music are living out some desperate [[wikt:wannabe|wannabe]] existence by using and knowing English terms for these things. It’s probably because with the English knowledge of these terms, one can find an even larger pool of interlocutors about a specific subject (or “lifestyle” object) online or even within Germany itself. These words become native to the speaker of that “lifestyle diglossia” in ways that those words are not “native” to the speakers of the language where these words ostensibly come from.<ref>{{cite web|author=Passmore, Ashley|title=In the New German, English is a "lifestyle diglossia"|url=http://www.60pages.com/in-the-new-german-english-is-a-lifestyle-diglossia/|access-date=2014-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233341/http://www.60pages.com/in-the-new-german-english-is-a-lifestyle-diglossia/|archive-date=2014-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref></blockquote>
