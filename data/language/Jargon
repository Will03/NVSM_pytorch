'''Jargon''' is a type of [[language]] that is used in a particular context and may not be well understood outside that context. The context is usually a particular occupation (that is, a certain trade, profession, or academic field), but any [[ingroups and outgroups|in group]] can have jargon. The main trait that distinguishes jargon from the rest of a language is special vocabulary—including some words specific to it, and often different [[word sense|senses]] or meanings of words, that out groups would tend to take in another sense—therefore misunderstanding that communication attempt. Jargon is thus "the technical terminology or characteristic idiom of a special activity or group".<ref name=m-w>{{cite web |title=Jargon |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jargon |work=Merriam Webster |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=29 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FTtjox9D?url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jargon |archivedate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Most jargon is '''technical terminology''' ('''technical terms'''), involving '''terms of art'''<ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Term of art}}</ref> or '''industry terms''', with particular meaning within a specific industry. A main driving force in the creation of technical jargon is precision and [[wikt:concise#Adjective|efficiency of communication]] when a discussion must easily range from general themes to specific, finely differentiated details without [[circumlocution]]. A side-effect of this is a higher threshold for comprehensibility, which is usually accepted as a [[trade-off]] but is sometimes even used as a means of [[social exclusion]] (reinforcing ingroup-outgroup barriers) or social aspiration (when intended as a way of showing off).

The philosopher [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] observed in 1782 that "every science requires a special language because every science has its own ideas". As a rationalist member of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], he continued: "It seems that one ought to begin by composing this language, but people begin by speaking and writing, and the language remains to be composed."<ref>Quoted by [[Fernand Braudel]], in discussing the origins of ''[[Capital (economics)|capital]]'', ''[[capitalism]]'', in ''The Wheels of Commerce'', vol. II of ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th–18th Century'', 1979:234. Originally found in Condillac's work [http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/Condillac/Commerce.html ''Le Commerce et le gouvernement considérés relativement l'un à l'autre'' (1776)].</ref>

Various kinds of language peculiar to ingroups can be named across a [[semantic field]]. [[Slang]] can be either culture-wide or known only within a certain group or subculture. [[Argot]] is slang or jargon [[obfuscation|purposely used to obscure meaning]] to outsiders. Conversely, a [[lingua franca]] is used for the opposite effect, helping communicators to overcome unintelligibility, as are [[pidgin]]s and [[creole language]]s. For example, the [[Chinook Jargon]] was a pidgin.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/jargon-linguistics</ref> Although technical jargon's primary purpose is to aid [[technical communication]], not to exclude outsiders by serving as an argot, it can have both effects at once and can provide a technical ingroup with [[shibboleth]]s. For example, medieval [[guild]]s could use this as one means of informal [[protectionism]]. On the other hand, jargon that once was obscure outside a small ingroup can become generally known over time. For example, the terms ''[[bit]], [[byte]],'' and ''[[hexadecimal]]'' (which are [[glossary of computer terms|terms from computing jargon]]<ref name="CB">{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=10866| title=Buzzwords– bang * splat !| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=2009-12-31| publisher=Criminal Brief|work=Don Martin School of Software}}</ref>) are now recognized by many people outside [[computer science]].

==Etymology==
The French word is believed to have been derived from the Latin word {{lang|la|gaggire}}, meaning "to chatter", which was used to describe [[speech]] that the listener did not understand. Middle English also has the verb {{lang|enm|jargounen}} meaning "to chatter", which comes from the French word.<ref name="etymonline">{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/jargon|title=Jargon|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref> The word may also come from [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|jargon}} meaning "chatter of birds".<ref name="etymonline" />

===Fields using the term===
The term is used, often interchangeably, with the term [[buzzword]]<ref>https://books.google.ca/books?id=eQ9UAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:xjw1HfQuPYAC&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjYksve5YngAhWE94MKHUCQD1QQ6AEIKjAA</ref> when examining [[organizational culture]]<ref>Martin, J. and Frost, P., 2011. The organizational culture war games. Sociology of organizations: Structures and relationships, 315.</ref>.

In linguistics, it is used to mean "specialist language,"<ref>https://books.google.ca/books?id=tppMDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&dq=linguistics+jargon+definition&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmw7aZ5ongAhUJ34MKHScfB9wQ6AEIRTAE</ref> with the term also seen as closly related to [[slang]] [[argot]] and cant<ref>https://books.google.ca/books?id=4Xdv4FTyXfkC&pg=PP7&dq=linguistics+jargon+definition&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmw7aZ5ongAhUJ34MKHScfB9wQ6AEISTAF</ref>.

==Industry term==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
"An industry term... is a type of technical terminology that has a particular meaning in a specific industry. It implies that a word or phrase is a typical one in a particular industry and people working in the respective industry or business will be familiar with and use the term."<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-4061994981/challenges-and-perspectives-in-teaching-specialised |last1=Peterlicean |first1=Andrea |title=Challenges and perspectives in teaching specialised languages|journal=The Journal of Linguistic and Intercultural Education|date=2015|volume=8|pages=149–162 |accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref>

Precise technical terms and their definitions are formally recognised, documented, and taught by educators in the field. Other terms are more colloquial, coined and used by practitioners in the field, and are similar to [[slang]]. The boundaries between formal and slang jargon, as in general English, are quite fluid. This is especially true in the rapidly developing world of computers and networking. For instance, the term ''[[Firewall (networking)|firewall]]'' (in the sense of a device used to filter network traffic) was at first technical slang. As these devices became more widespread and the term became widely understood, the word was adopted as formal terminology.

Technical terminology evolves due to the need for experts in a field to communicate with precision and brevity, but often has the effect of excluding those who are unfamiliar with the particular specialized language of the group. This can cause difficulties as, for example, when a patient is unable to follow the discussions of medical practitioners, and thus cannot understand his own condition and treatment. Differences in jargon also cause difficulties where professionals in related fields use different terms for the same phenomena.

==Accessibility issues==
With the rise of the [[self-advocacy]] movement within the disability movement, ''jargonised'' language has been much objected to by advocates and self-advocates. Jargon is largely present in every day language, in newspapers, government documents, and official forms. Several advocacy organisations work on influencing public agents to offer accessible information in different formats.<ref name="northampton">{{cite web|url=http://www.northampton.gov.uk/info/200041/equality_and_diversity/1309/jargon_buster| title=Jargon buster – Accessible Information * splat !| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=2013-04-05| publisher=Northampton Borough Council|work=Northampton Borough Council}}</ref> One accessible format that offers an alternative to jargonised language is [[Easy_Read|Easy Read]], which consists of a combination of plain English and images. Other resources include online glossaries of technical jargon, also known as a "jargon busters." <ref name="involve">{{cite web|url=http://www.invo.org.uk/resource-centre/jargon-buster/| title=Jargon buster – Involve * splat !| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=2013-04-05|work=Involve}}</ref> There is a balance to be struck, as excessive removal of technical terminology from a document leads to an equally undesirable outcome—[[dumbing down]].{{citation needed |date=January 2018}}

==Examples==
Many examples of jargon exist because of its use among specialists and subcultures alike. In the professional world, those who are in the business of filmmaking may use words like "vorkapich" to refer to a montage when talking to colleagues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/filmterms20.html|title=Cinematic Terms – A FilmMaking Glossary|work=filmsite.org}}</ref> In Rhetoric, rhetoricians use words like "arete" to refer to a person of power's character when speaking with one another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/arete|title=Dictionary.com - Find the Meanings and Definitions of Words at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}</ref>
